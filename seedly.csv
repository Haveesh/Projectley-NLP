4,"No frills telco, but do give existing customers something to look forward to too. Looking to switch to giga if it doesn't improve."
5,"APPLICATION PROCESS  The application process was really smooth. I just need my phone and my bank card ready. Applied online and waited for my new sim to arrive. It actually arrived next day despite applying on a Sunday afternoon!  CONNECTION IN MRT I travelled the red line daily, played Mobile Legend while on train, didn't experience much of a connection drop as compared to my previous telco. Signal in underground is pretty strong and fast, but definitely not as good as above the ground.   PRICE As I've ported in from other telco, I get an additional 2GB/month free. For only $28/month! With no contract somemore. Many other telco are starting to offer SIM-ONLY plans, but the reason to stay with Circle is because they offer 500MB/month for every 6 months staying with them. Meaning that, in ur 2 years contract with other telco, I'll be getting additional 2GB/month free for staying with Circle. "
4,Impressive branding at the start. App has a great UI.   Signed up for my family because it was convenient to track how much data they've consumed. 
4,"I haven‚Äôt started yet, and I really would have if it wasn‚Äôt for M1‚Äôs latest 30GB plan. But, still giving a 4 stars because I love that they were one of the pioneers to shake things up for the giants to react.   Wouldn‚Äôt mind giving it a shot if I‚Äôm ever done with my M1 plan. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
5,"2 years on Circles.Life and their Customer Support and Marketing folks are awesome. Hear us rant and give us data with surprises.  But that‚Äôs not all. They are the 1st Telco that truly listens.  2 years, 2 extra GB of data, many more years to come!"
4,Have always wanted to swap over to Circles but I'm still stuck in my contract. Love the marketing and design direction of the product. Glad to see a new telco competitor in the Singaporean market. 
5,Signed up for the $0 no contract 1 GB data plan. I am happy so far and would highly recommend to anyone who wants to cut down expenses. 
5,"Been on Circles Life for 2 Years now. I would say no much difference in term of call usage and data connectivity with compared to other telcos.  What makes it a winner is the no contract Circles Life‚Äôs base plan $28 + $20 for 20Gb(Now revised to unlimited data). This is one of the cheapest plan you can get for unlimited data usage in Singapore.  However there is a catch, it has a fair usage policy attached that will throttle your data speeds after you surpass 20GB each month.   My plan currently:  For $50 per month, this is what i get - Base data 6GB + 20GB(add on) at 4G speed, subsequently at managed speed good for basic app use and surfing net.  - Outgoing calls 100 minutes - SMS 25 - Free Incoming calls   Conclusion: If you are looking for monthly subscription with add on data plan at affordable price, Circle‚Äôs Life is the telco for you.   "
5,"Circles.Life offers great plans! Using their 1 GB $0 flat plan and it was absolutely fuss free.  Used their plan to hop over from my legacy Singtel plan and they took care of everything. Even when i was using my dads line, he just had to sign his signature on the app to transfer ownership and provide his NRIC. No need to go down to the service centre! Yesssss. "
5,"Circles life offering best plan to the customers, they allowing customer to change their data plan according to their monthly needs monthly. Again, it‚Äôs not one month or two months, it is every month!  Circles life partnering with a lot of company throughout the years, and resulting in a lot of different interesting promotion to customers. SOme examples are EZ-Link, SP Power and etc.  "
5,Next customer service ever unlike other telco sometimes Circles.Life will surprise customer with reward and stuff
4,"Pros : - no infra lightweight low cost operating model. So all service / add on via self service app. Which is must better than have to call CSO and wait for donkey years. best value for price paid and data   Cons: -no SMS when needed as some services still required. . So it becomes hidden cost. - renting infra from M1, so inherit the same problem, no data 2 to 3 stations up and down Serangoon mrt.   -. - Overall still better than old boys except the inherited problem from M1"
5,"It has been a great experience so far after switching away from Singtel (Customer Service was bad, response time was bad and I could not even understand the customer service officer)  Except for the poor coverage network while on the tunnels, it has been a great experience so far (as compared to Singtel)"
5,"I've been with Circles Life since they first came to Singapore. And I've never had an issue with them. Their customer service is not only easily reachable via their chat, they are very helpful and do their best to help you in any way possible. I've recommended them to a number of people who are now paying half of what they used to pay with their previous telcos and are currently enjoying more freedom and benefits with Circles Life's customizable and affordable plans. Looking forward to many more years with Circles Life. "
5,"An unbiased review, as I've been a Singtel, Starhub and M1 subscriber before.   Initially, when Circles came into the market, I was rather skeptical. I was on M1 then, and was rather pleased with their services compared to the other 2 Telcos stated. Didn't think or moving over to them at the time, that's until my workplace sent out an email stating that they have a CIS package.   Curious, I tried it out for a month since there's no contract. Registration was straightforward and received my SIM card from the post office. Hassle-free, base plan was decent. I was only concerned of the coverage though.   After a month using their services, I was pretty much sold to them. Their online chat made it easy to seek clarifications and doubts, and their turnaround time is way better than the 3 other Telcos. I have had to wait for more than 15 mins the least before I manage to get someone on the line,  and that is before I have to go through the frustrating process of listening to the teleprompter.   As for data usage, it is very decent, with circles will add on thru their daily polls, tie-ins with ezylink and also occasionally giving free unlimited data like the one ongoing for National Day.   All in all, what made them better is that they do listen to their user base, unlike the other 3 Telcos. Try them out for a month or two like what I did, and you be the judge. "
5,"I felt trapped initially with fixed plans, with no hope for the future of bountiful data. Until circles life came along, with customisable plans, and great data options. Life is worth living again. Along with great CS and plans, what else more can one want?"
4,"Honestly it has good customer service, decent internet speed (from M1) although there are numerous other cheaper alternatives for unlimited data elseway for cheaper prices! "
4,"Been using Circles for close to a year now.  For data hungry users who are never able to resist clicking on the clickbaity video on Facebook, or the ones who have too much time to spare but no access to WiFi, their ""$20 for 20GB"" add-on is perfect. Coupled with the $3 for unlimited data for 24h (resets at 00:00) when you run out of data again not so accidentally, you are able to get more than 25GB of data for ~$50 a month.  My only qualm with this Telco is the initial delivery of SIM cards which a lot of people, inclusive of myself, have faced. Thankfully, I was able to get the card the next working day without further problems."
4,"I've been with Circles.Life for a couple of months, and I'm happy to say that I'm pleased so far. The plan is very affordable for $28, and if you require any add-ons, you can do so with the CirclesCare app. The CirclesCare app is sleek and easy to maneuver around. One of the common complaints of Circles.Life is that its network connection can become weak when your MRT goes underground, however I've not experienced this before. Personally, one of the greatest virtue of Circles.Life is how the company always has the welfare of the public at heart. Not only is it constantly having promotions to attract potential new users to join, it is also coming up with more activities and deals for existing users too. This is something that I really appreciate of Circles.Life."
5,"When my Singtel contract was up, I was looking for a more affordable alternative that is able to fit my needs. I stumbled upon Circles.Life, and I was shook. If you're someone who is comfortable with up to 6GB per month, you would love Circles.Life too. You only need to pay $28! Furthermore, there is free bonus data too. For every 6 months you stay with Circles.Life, you will receive an additional PERMANENT 500mb of data. Also, if your friends and family members use your referral code to hop on Circles.Life, you'll get an additional PERMANENT 200mb of data. Shiok right?   If you feel that you need to boost certain features such as more capacity for data or SMS, the base plan allows for customisation too. Similar to how we choose our sides in Astons (e.g. my fav mac & cheese with potato wedges), you can pick your preferred choice such as boosting your data in blocks of 500mb, 1GB or 2GB depending on your data usage for that month.  You can easily do so with the CirclesCare app with a few thumb clicks.  From my experience, the porting is convenient and hassle free. More importantly, with no contract comes no obligations. You can simply jump to another telco if a better deal pops out, or if Circles.Life isn't up to your standard. However, all that glitters is not gold, there are users of Circles.Life who experienced a slower network especially in ulu places. Personally, I've been using Circles.Life for close to half a year, and I don't have such a problem. So you may want to give it a try if you're keen! :)"
4,"I've been on Circles for 3 months now and it has been such a refreshing experience. I really love the intuitve layout of the app and how things such as temporary suspension could be done easily. I especially love the reminders they send occassionally on the loyalty bonus, it keeps users like myself excited. But most importantly, cared about. That's why Circles wins my hearts because this is a product that is marketed and created to serve our needs. I'm really happy with all the services but since is a honest review, I shall name some bad too. Connection are bad in underground stations- There was once I lost my connection in the train from Outram to Hougang. It is only when i stepped out of the train, did I had connection. But since I stay in the West and takes the EWL, that was just one small issue. Also, the extra charge during the first month was a little shocking. Especially for me as I got the bill just 3 days after I'm with Circles, I immediately second think if I made a wrong decision haha. But nonethless, all's good, all's good! Circles please continue doing all these great stuff and I'll continue to stay loyal, get my friend onboard to earn those data heehee ‚ù§"
4,"One of the best no contract signups that i ever had and with the data bundle, is great for mobile game players like me.  Coverage seems much better then SingTel and though at times, the network coverage and performance takes a dip in certain rural areas.  Overall - good job and keep the competition on SingTel and the rest!"
5,The best telco I‚Äôve ever used. It‚Äôs been well over a year and I haven‚Äôt encountered any issues with circles. Very pleased. 
5,"Very affordable with a lot of data. However sometimes data connection is a bit slow. App is also very informative regarding bills, data plans & even events going on in Singapore."
5,"Been using Circle.Life since 2017 and I've gotta say, it is awesome. The payment, delivery, processing of the SIM card, and switching it on my mobile is freaking smooth. I didn't even require anyone to help me out. To add on, the connection is great! I didn't have any problem with it. And what's great about it is, I have plenty of data to use and I don't need to worry about the cost! I'm really happy that I switched to Circle.Life. Previously, I've been struggling on the amount of data that I've used and the expensive bills that pile up but now, I don't have to worry about it! I am a 100% happy being on board with Circle.Life! "
5,I was a pioneer with circlelife. Was with them since then till now. For more than 3 years I'm saving alot on my bills. Coverage was excellent throughout Singapore. What I appreciate most is when they extended the 20gb for $28 base plan for existing customers. Will not consider changing telco and will always stick with circlelife.
4,"they are a telco that listen to customer needs, easy to change your plans settings on the go with the app. no complicated deals and packages. Easy to understand terms and condition.   HOWEVER, im not sure if its circles only or its a problem faced by other telco or an iphone with a thick casing issue. Whenever im travelling past certain MRT station of singapore, my data connection gets cut off.  overall, its been a good telco compare to the other telco that i have used before or currently using as my 2nd number."
5,"VALUE FOR MONEY: 5/5 20GB for 18/month is the best value for money right now in Singapore.  APPLICATION PROCESS: 5/5 Submitted application in the morning and received my SIM within 3 hours! The SIM was activated within 24 hours of receiving it.  ADD ONS: 3/5 They offered free caller ID for Corporate customers, which was great. However, they charge $2 for unlimited incoming calls. Not a big fan of that decision.  Also, there is an option to pay $20 for unlimited data. However, ""unlimited"" means you still have a cap around 40 GB.   APP EXPERIENCE: 5/5 Their app is sleek and very useful unlike other telcos in Singapore.  OVERALL: 4.5/5 Amazing telco. I have subscribed to 2 other telcos in the past, so far Circles beats them by a huge margin."
5,"Circles.Life is a beacon of hope in the generally derided telco space. Excellent coverage and service plans (gotta love that bonus data!), and a quirky brand personality that really sets them apart.  They're one of the (very) few companies that I've fallen in love with twice over. I was in SG for a short stint last year, and opted for them because they were cost-effective, but went on to be super impressed by the quick and effortless registration/activation process, and their very awesome Customer Support team, which made them the no-brainer choice when I moved back here again. I'm a delighted customer, and can't recommend them enough! "
5,Really love circle life. Have been using it 1 years plus and really love it. And how they give National Day gift as unlimited date which I love it so much hahaha!! That I can use data freely for about one week. Thank you circle life and I really wish to wish this $50 grab voucher because it really help me a lot to travel around as I working need to travel a lot. And this $50 can really save my life for maybe a few trips 
5,"APPLICATION PROCESS I was the pioneer batch of 4GB before they started the current 20GB base plan. The application process was really smooth. You just need to move the slider around to customise your mobile plan. All the on-screen instructions and procedures are clear. You just need your phone and bank card ready. I applied online and waited for my new SIM card to arrive. It arrived 3 days later via a courier to your door, both the new phone and SIM card. There's tracking system on where the delivery stage is as well. Especially for those who are new to this MVNO that doesn't have any existing shop, this ensures there's some reliability and assurance. During this period, you're also given a temporary number during the porting process. Though the old number is still available for call.  NETWORK CONNECTIVITY I travelled throughout the whole Singapore most of the time. Back then the dead zone was in Yishun area, so I feedback to them via their Facebook page. While on train, there isn't much issue. Possible ones are only when moving across signal towers, like Jurong East to Clementi. There's connection in the underground as well, way better than it started off. And definitely much better than other Big 3, that will even drop to 3G network. Signal in underground is pretty strong and fast, managed to watch a Running Man episode as well underground in the Downtown Line.  CUSTOMER SERVICE They have a 24-hours service helpline there, if there's no one, it will still be logged on their side and addressed immediately. They are very helpful in answering your questions and doubts. Back then for the Yishun network dead zone, they solve it after you have pinpoint them the exact location that you have found. They will add another repeater in that area. The other time was, during my reservist period. My second phone was still using the whole 2G network under Singtel, before they announced eliminating the network entirely to move towards 3G baseline network. So I asked them if they give another SIM card under the same line, and they said it's possible!   PRICE As I've ported in from other telecom, they will give you another 1GB for only $28/month! No strings attached, no contract liability, as compared to others with a minimal of 2 years contract. What's more, Circles.Life will give 500MB for every 6 months loyalty. Now they introduced a 20GB base plan. Back then I thought old existing users won't get it, just like other telecom that forces you to recontract with them again. But NO, they in fact give you the 20GB as well to enjoy with the rest of the community.   BONUS All your mobile plan are controlled inside an app by theirs. So you can mix-and-match anytime to change and suit your needs. Likewise, if you are planning to go JB, just turn on your data roaming on the app. They are activated a few minutes later! No more asking for roaming services via some website and wait for weeks to process. They now have a quiz section, that if you answered by the majority you get extra data as well! Gone the times you have to struggle, and think of how much data limit you have to plan out for this week, just so you have enough for the remaining days. Going green, the monthly bill payment are stored in the app, no more fussy monthly bill posted to you. And occasionally they will offer event-based bonus data, like 500MB extra data on your birthday, and now even a 12 days of unlimited data during the National Day season! Where to get this kind of stuffs, you tell me! "
5,"APPLICATION The application process is completed online. I left my work e-mail on the CIS website and received a CIS code within the day. The CIS code stacked with the $120 cashback when I opted to port over my number from StarHub. I opted to collect my SIM card from SingPost, and could track when the port over would take place online. Meanwhile, I had no problems with using my existing SIM card. The whole process was seamless and fuss free.  CONNECTIVITY There were no teething issues with connectivity. While there were some difficulty accessing 4G in certain locations (e.g. between certain stations on the NEL or in the underground passageway at the Singapore Indoor Stadium), by and large the connection was stable and strong. By signing up through CIS, I got an additional 6GB of data for a year along with 3 additional months of bill credits (capped at $28/month). This made Circles.Life the most value-for-money telco in the market for me.  SUPPORT I was able to reach customer support easily, even on weekends or weekday nights, through their Facebook page. I got prompt replies, within minutes at times.  APP From the Circles.Life app, I am able to easily view my past and upcoming bills and track my data, call, and SMS usage. I am also able to easily change my credit card number. Most importantly, I am able to activate add ons to boost my data or activate roaming boosts for overseas travel. I can also set data spending alerts and caps. I am thankful that Circles.Life also runs promotions such as the most recent NDP promo which gave free unlimited data for over 10 days in August.  OVERALL Having tried other traditional operators and VMNOs, I find that Circles.Life has done extremely well in meeting my data hungry needs and continues to reward existing users. I highly recommend Circles.Life for data heavy users and those with CIS plans. 5/5!"
5,"Application Process: It was a smooth one, I would say. It only took 2days for my simcard to be shipped which I collected at SingPost.  Network Connection: There's no perfect Telco Provider. So there were times when the data reception is quite bad. But it never lasts for long. It would also prolly be because of the area, which is common to telcos.  Customer Service: They don't have a contact # to call in case you want to ring them for an enquiry, issue etc.. Instead, they have a live chat. Though again, there's no perfect telco provider, so I've already experienced shady officers which the good thing about CirclesLife is that, they will get back to you to sort things out when they feel thay you're not happy with the outcome of your concern.  Value-For-Money: Unlimited data is something everyone would surely prefer. Though their gadgets are a bit pricey, their services on the other hand are affordable."
5,"Great mobile plan! Have been with circles for over 2 years and I can say I haven't been disappointed once with their prices, connection and also the amount of days given.  Am currently on their $28/month and it is the cheapest I have ever paid ever since secondary school. Would recommend! "
5,"Circles offers great plans, especially during their promotions! Application process is seamless, and customer service is good"
5,registration is hassle free. 18sgd a month for 20+ gb data is a great deal. awesome customer support
5,"So happy that i decided to switch to circles life, it was the best decision ever üôåüèª I used to only have 3GB of data every month and would always overshot and be forced to pay an extra $10 just for an extra GB. But now with circles life, I have 20 GB every month and my data never runs out anymore. I could even on it 24/7 and still wouldn‚Äôt be able to finish using it. Esp with the current National Day special where there is unlimited date from 7-19 August, which makes it even more worthwhile. So what are you waiting for? Join Circles. Life now and reap the benefits instantly!! Not to mention there are also weekly giveaways on the Circles.Life app, what more could I ask for? ü§©üíò"
5,"value for money !! def worth it to sign here, but could have given more data and voicecall, otherwise all is good! customer service isnt bad too every problem solved within minutes ! give this a thumbs up boys"
5,The best telco in Singapore. Service is fast and excellent. All members of my family has switch to Circle.Life
5,"Thanks for the free GBüòç got them from caroysell land, internet connection was really good and fuss free sign up! "
5,"Switched from Starhub, which I paid roughly $25/month for 2GB data. Now I'm paying less for almost 10 times the monthly data. Most importantly, I'm no longer bound by contracts that starts with a minimum of 12 months. Good signal coverage most of the time, awesome telco to subscribe to."
4,"Quite a smooth and direct process in application, and the plans are attractive too. Had some difficulties with the bill breakdown and misunderstanding of charges but customer service (chat service) was very prompt to resolve the issue. Service officer was polite and knowledgeable in offering solutions, which then changed my intention from termination to continuing my service with Circles. I had plenty of questions towards the fees and policies but he could explain each part in clear details + examples. So kudos in that, didn't have to get confused further. Probably the downside would be the lack in call centre which would have save a lot of time since talking could just get things clear within minutes, rather than chatting through app/email which could take hours or even days for each other to reply at different timings. Hopefully Circles continue to keep up with their quick customer service and valuable plans. "
5,"Love circles life telco! Honestly is the best, as u can customise all you want in your line. They will always check with you about their services and how to improve them by giving its users surveys. "
5,"Really appreciate the presence of no contract data! Circle life first started this program, and it's benefitting to alot of Singaporeans. Slowly, other telecom joins as well.  Additionally, I really like the interface of the apps. It's bug free, from my experience! Great job!"
5,Cheap cost and lots of data. Been using this since their launch and no regrets ever since. They have a many different options for how you want to use your data and the versatility is something that I can appreciate greatly. They are constantly coming up with better promotions to one up competitors so you never lose out in terms of pricing. Great Telco!
5,Circles life are the best telco platform that I ever use. Best internet plan and good network coverage! support.
5,Customising to your telco needs as and when and save $.. Its even better now that it has roaming data plan at lower rates. What's best is that the loyalty and referral programs!! Wohoo!! 
5,"For only $28/month! With no contract somemore. Many other telco are starting to offer SIM-ONLY plans, but the reason to stay with Circle is because they offer 500MB/month for every 6 months staying with them. It means during your 2 years contract with other telco, You‚Äôll  be getting additional 2GB/month free for staying with Circle. Highly recommend to use it!!"
5,"I was a bit worried initially when I ported over to Circles Life because Circles Life seemed ""cheap"" in comparison to major players like Singtel and Starhub, but the data connectivity and amazing customer service only made me regret why I did not make the switch earlier.  APPLICATION PROCESS - User friendly and easy application process - Managed to port in to Circles Life without any disruptions - They helped to cancel my previous line with Starhub, and made the transition very smooth - Delivery of my new SIM card was available within 1-2 working days and was right on time  COST & VALUE - $20/month - 20 GB of data (free data surprises at times) - 100 mins outgoing calls - UNLIMITED incoming calls - 25 SMS (if you ever need it)  CONVENIENCE - Extensive FAQ which can answer most of my queries - 24/7 customer service team that is contactable via live chat or email anytime - Automated bill payment via my credit card every month"
5,Circles Life has cut down my entire family‚Äôs mobile telecom bill by a few hundred dollars a month. A no brainer to move from other telcos. 
3,"Overall it's well but not considered as good enough , the most disappointing is new port in member could get lower price package even just for certain period , but how can be old member need to paid higher for same package , since you are having promotion , just let the new and old member could enjoy it  , it's unfair to old member ."
4,"I was an early adopter of $0/mth Flexi-Plan in June 2018. This plan has 1GB data, 30 minutes talktime, 10 SMS, free caller ID. Though no overseas roaming service available. Those who are frequent travellers would need to take note.   Signup can only be done on Circlelife website as there is no retail or agent stores.   Signing up on their website was quite simple. Just create a new Circlelife account with personal particulars, choose $0/mth Flexi Plan, upload my digital copy of NRIC and lastly fill in a Credit Card number. Delivery of SIM card by courier cost $6, there was no self-collection site.   Porting from other telcos is available during signup and there is an option to port at a later stage after activation. I choose not to port over first as I wanted to try on their network before deciding.   Received my Circlelife SIM card within a week, pop in the SIM card into my mobile phone and was immediately activated ready to use.   I could download the Circlelife app to check on data, talktime, SMS usage for the month and to boost/topup my data or talktime at a cost if I ever need to. I could also do a port in from other telco, on this line, at some other time with the app itself. This is great flexibility!  Also, the app has a online Live Chat function with their customer serivce staff when I have an enquiry. The Live Chat does not respond immediately when activated, there will still be some minutes of waiting time before someone respond to my enquiry.   Reception wise for 4G network is good at outdoor and indoor buildings as Circlelife piggy bank on M1 network. There was fast data connection speed outdoor and no drop call connections ever experience before.  However, whenever I was in a moving train along North East MRT, especially Kovan to Serangoon, 4G data reception and 4G data speed in was non-existence. This still happening in 2019.  I would need to manually switched to 3G on my mobile phone to get a usable data connection.   I have already used this Flexi-Plan on my spare phone for more than 12 months and Circlelife is still continuing this $0/mth plan with no changes in plan price yet. According to the Circlelife's customer service staff on livechat, as long I have usage on this line, either data or talktime in the last 3 months, this line will not be suspended or terminated.   Overall, other than the non-existence 4G data network along some North East MRT line, which was bearable as I don't commute that line often. I would recommend this Flexi-Plan to any low data/talktime usage users, such as the elderly or for usage in a spare phone or tablet.   "
5,"Circles.Life has an easy application process just by doing it online. It is fuss-free, just taking a few minutes to fill up my particulars, make payment and viola, their staff processes the application within a few days and got back to me on the delivery of my SIM card. They have excellent customer service, even through the Facebook Messenger channel which I prefer since I‚Äôm busy working during the office hours and couldn‚Äôt really make a call. Even though there was a hiccup with the payment for registration initially causing a double charge to my card, the staff handled it situation well and were quick to process a refund for me and provide me with regular updates for the refund. Amazing telco with the customer in mind!"
4,"It was great to have that no-contract.  get bonus datas for no reasons pretty much!  super helpful customer service!! That was superb  only thing was that new customers seemed to be getting better deals etc.. which felt bad, but then again we would get more data and freebies etc... (for me it was about price, as never manage to fulfil data caps) "
4,The ability to have live chat is a good option. I solved many of my queries via live chat. Generally their app is good. Ability to switch on and off roaming quickly is also Good!
5,Really good the application process was really easy to install and use and the mobile plans great üëçüèº 
4,circles is reasonably reliable and offers competitive pricing for its services. the one downside is that there is no hotline to call when you feel like screaming at someone. great way to train your capacity for patience. 8/10.
5,I have been a user of circle line since May 2018 when they launch a free 1GB data line. The line is stable and never face any problem. I like it very much hope to continue using it.
5,"I signed on with Circles 2 years back and I have been very pleased with their services since and it is definitely value for money for the amount of data I get. The app's UX/UI design is great, love it!  I also love that there are options to boost your data by their partnership programs such as linking your EZLINK to the app. Something I recommend to my friends looking to switch telcos.   Love to see more perks from Circles for sure!    "
5,"Basically excellent plan for no-frills, low-cost data and mobile usage.  Super value for money - I only pay $30ish/mth for 20++GB of data, sufficient call time and text.  Easy to use app to monitor and customize plan. Can tweak plan requirements on demand. Now with added options for easier use of data bundle while traveling even.   Good responsive customer service.  If you are not in need of the latest cell phone, and don't want to be bound by contract , this is definitely the plan for you! "
4,At times connection is poor but overall it was good. The plan does help to save alot and it is affordable. Convenient for users to customize according to own needs. I will recommend thid plan to my friends. 
5,"Sign up was easy Network wise along NEL there will be some disconnection, not sure if it's device or network despite showing 4G network  Overall experience is good, service replies are quick if you have any questions/doubts "
5,"Circle Life is one the rare MVNO which have excellent CRM and responsive to subscribers. Plus their Circle.Life APP which is easily to use and have other useful functions. Last but no t least, they have their own Insider facebook closed group , which organised activities for CL""s insiders,. I think it is awesome and one of the kind MVNO out here! "
5,"Great affordable fuss free sim only plan. Great customer support as well, the interface is user - friendly as well. Truly a remarkable feat"
5,"Have been a fan since I onboarded with Circles.Life in 2016!  [On-boarding Process] Simple and hassle free. Ported with old M1 number over as well.   [Customer Service]  No need to queue for hours at M1 just to change payer for mobile bill? Another big win for me.   [Data Connectivity]  So far, so good!   [Customer Perks]  500MB extra for birthdays, and now UNLIMITED DATA DAILY in August until 19th August! #streamvideosalldaylong  [Flexibility] Love the flexibility of being able to add data boosts on the Circles app on a as-needed basis.   [Community] Last but not least, I absolutely LOVE how their team really looks at fostering the community. Have been to a few of their Inner Circles events, and we've done things from archery to acai bowl workshops! Loads and loads of fun <3  Verdict: Super satisfied customer and advocate!  "
4,"A lot of people look at the price/value proposition of the service and concluded that it is not as good as the other providers. True. They are a MVNO, using another telco's network to provide the service but that's where things started to be different.   They have at least taken care of the current customers a bit more than the competition.   How do you get FREE unlimited data for a whopping 10 days just because they want to?   In the end, i shifted from TWO telcos and both lines are now with Circles.Life.   Do understand that not all services will be perfect. There are spotty connections in some odd places in Singapore. The best part is that there is no contract to tie you down so you can change to another service provider should the connection be bad.  To me the best customer service is the one that allows you to leave if they are not up to your standard. For that Circles.Life gets full points from me."
5,"One month into Circles.Life, so far it's all good. If you are greed for data, you should definitely go for Circles.Life! I also really like how you can customise your data plan every month!"
5,"SIM delivery arrived exactly as scheduled. No fuss on the number porting, hardly any service disruption. Just switch your phone SIM on midnight of the next business day. Free 20 GB for the month of August for National Day too!"
5,"If you don't qualify for the CIS promo but still want an additional 2GB on top of the 6GB (total 8GB), plus free incoming calls (so no impact on the 100 min talk time), PM me for the code. Limited quantity, until Dec 2018.  Application process was simple and extremely convenient, the app is easy to use and helps me keep track of everything easily, great interface."
2,"To be honest; registration was fast, delivery of SIM card was fast.. but getting hold of them on call is not as fast.  I remembered getting a connection issue @ AMK mrt station and contacting the team wasn't as easy. Also, I had wanted to give 3 stars but reduced to 2 because despite the high gb data given by circles life; their data tracking is just truly off the charts.  I measure my usage as less than 3gb on starhub & singtel; but on circles I always uses up my 21gb data. Now that's totally explainable. I have feedback and because it's been months since I switched back to Starhub (who have thankfully improved on their data roaming reliability) so hopefully circles has improved in this aspect."
5,"Circles life has been great so far for me. The porting process is hassle free and the connectivity is good while using 4G, now I get so much data and I‚Äôm paying way cheaper then my previous telco I would definitely recommend it"
4,"I just switched from Singtel to Circles recently. What really attracted me was the extra data I am getting for just $28/month. However,I do feel that my connectivity was better with Singtel even though it isn‚Äôt much of a concern to me. The unlimited WhatsApp was a game changer for me with 70% of my data being used to connect with my clients. Till date,I still believe that it is a good switch and I do not see myself switching to any other competing telcos. "
2,"Used it for 2 years, then decided to port over to Singtel as singtel had more competitive rates. Good whilst it lasted, but when porting, they didn't cancel my account and continued to charge sgd 28 every month for 2 months, although the overseas-based email customer service have said they terminated my line. Still waiting for the refund to happen (been 2 mths) and hoping they don't charge me a 3rd month. Avoid."
4,"My first non contract plan I signed after being tied with SingTel for donkey years.   The pros: - Considered cheap back then when there are no other competitors like Zero1  - Very very very good customer support. Speedy reply and very patient and understand.  - Their loyalty bonus data and mini games that gives bonus data   The cons: - When other telco start to up their game, the price plan for circles life doesn‚Äôt seem so attractive anymore.  -Tap on M1 network which is pretty slow at certain places. Like underground MRT, shopping Malls.  Changed to Zero1 after a few months due to a better pricing. Check out my review over there."
4,"Been with Circles for 1.5 years.  Initially had a lot of issues with connectivity/stability with 4G. Customer service although painful, was still a whole lot better as compared to other mobile carriers'. My major issues would be data connectivity when overseas - it works fine 1-2 days, after that, it's dead. Happened to me in China (exorbitant rates with no tie up partners), and Japan. I look forward to when they offer more competitive and comprehensive data roaming packages/partnerships. Otherwise, it's a breeze to use in Singapore - data usage without a second thought."
3,"Thought I want to share with the community my recent experience. I changed from Starhub (over 4 years now with them) to Circles Life. Mainly because Circles Life offers more data for much chearper.  6 September Thursday - I signed up on their website and paid the fees due for the package that I chose. Immediately got a welcome email etc. The process was very smooth and very easy.  Circles Life will give you 2 options for the delivery of the SIM card 1) Send to your house/office 2) Self Pick Up at a post office of your choice. I chose to Self Pick Up at Post Office.  7 September Friday - Got an email to remind me that I can pick up the SIM card at the post office from 11 Sept to 14 Sept. Ok noted.  10 September Monday - Got another reminder email of my pickup date etc.  So this is when it got strange.  I got a call, I guess from one of their staff to confirm the delivery address. The delivery address is obviously the address of the post office because from the drop down menu on the website, you just choose which post office you want to pick it up from. So this staff asked if I worked at the post office......  I said huh? What do you mean? So he said since its delivery to a post office address he thought I worked at the post office. I said no! I choose the option on the website to self pick up at post office la! Like seriously..  So I think they were confused on how to get me the simcard, he asked me to text my house address and maybe they will send it to me personally. Also asked me what time will I be at home. But now that I think about it, why would they ask me for my house address?? They should have all those details which I provided when I signed up on their website right?? Suspicious.  So I waited, but no call or anything. The next thing I knew I got an email saying ""We could no longer hold onto your Welcome Pack at your pick-up location....Please click on the button below to reschedule your pick-up / delivery........Please note that if you can't pick-up your Welcome Pack in time, each rescheduled pick-up / delivery will be charged $15""  So basically my ""scheduled delivery/pick up"" was cancelled not because of me and to reschdule I have pay additional SGD15??  Then I went to their website to Live Chat with someone at Circles Life. Ok I must say there was a person on the other side chatting to me and she was quite professional in the way she answered my question etc. She managed to waive the SGD15 charge because not my fault that this happened.  So this lady said she needs to bring this up to the team to check further what happened. Of course this is fine because it was already close to 8PM.   However the email to me did say they were going to get back to me on why this has happened.  Anyway, now the delivery/pick up was rescheduled to 12 September. 1 day gone already.  11 September - Got a call Circles Life late evening around 7PM asking me to confirm my IC number and date of issue. I happened to be in the middle of something that I didn't have wallet with me. But really? Shouldn't they already have such information??? I said to the person I am in the middle of something now I don't have the Issue Date of my IC. He said this is really urgent he's at the warehouse and needs these details to send the package out. I said I don't have the Issue Date, but I can give him my IC number la...he said ok. So gave him my IC number.  12 September - I got an email on the tracking number, and I was able to pick up my new SIM card at my chosen post office. Number was ported over the same night.  I still didn't get an email from them explaining why original delivery was cancelled.   So I have been using Circles Life a little over a day now, no issues with the speed, connection etc. However I experienced some connection problems with one of my mobile games. Another weird problem which I can't figure out.  But I have to say I never experienced like this with Starhub, basically you go to their store, they give you sim card on the spot and that's it.  All in all, I will save around SGD40 in my phone bill with Circles Life as compared to Starhub with alot more data, but perhaps the above problems shouldn't have happened as they have been around for some time now. Furthermore they shouldn't be asking for all this personal data when they should have all this in the first place right?  Also for those who sign up, when you first sign up at the website its really not much especially with the promo code etc. However what is not so clear from the beginning is that once your sign up is successful, your first bill will be the current month pro rated charges and the next months bill combined. So you will be paying quite alot on your first bill. You will only pay what you signed up for the second month after."
4,"In itself, Circles.Life is a customer-centric, marketing-focused company.   It leverages on product marketing to differentiate itself, and has been experimenting with various ways to talk to their customers, especially whenever there are inquiries.   I have been a customer since 2016 as an early adopter.   So far so good..."
5,"What is better than cheap stuff? FREE STUFF OF COURSE. I registered as an early user and even delivery was free, though you have to pay $6 now. It is still worth it as a supplementary phone card with free 1GB Data per month. Satisfied user so far."
5,"Very good and efficient service! In the long term, it helps saves money as well, since i don't have the habit of changing phones every year/every 2 years.  "
5,"Tip: check if you have CIS plan under your company, you get 2gb more under CIS, on top of the 2gb port in bonus. This could effectively give you 8gb if you are under corporate plan.  Love this plan because it gives 6gb for $28, with the flexibility of adding more options (ie, data) according to how much more I want/need.  Phone bill is billed straight to your credit card (so unfortunately you can't use this as one of the bills to pay to hit your bank account criterias). "
5,Ported my number in last year from M1 and never looked back. Super star service and more GB than I can ever imagine. Highly recommend their service.
5,"Definitely happy with the network on Circles.Lift so far.  What I love the most are:  - No contract obligations  - Flexible plans (can change your monthly plans at any point of time)  - Quick online response (no need to hold on the line)  - The app is easy to use and gives you a clear overview on how much you used (e.g. data, call times, SMS).   Without them, big telcos will forever offer 2 years contracts.  Keep going, Circles.Life! "
4,Just switched from StarHub to Circles Life about a week ago. I'm expecting my current Circles Life bill to be $28 for 8GB. This is a huge improvement from StraHub which I had to pay > $50 for just 6GB. This switch allowed me to use data more liberally. Connectivity isn't the best but I can live with it for now. Hopefully it remains competitive :)
5,"There's a widget for your Android mobile phone that displays remaining data, if you installed the CirclesCare App. Best deal in the history of trade deals. 5/7 would recommend."
3,"Switched over from M1 since 1 year ago. Perfect for local use as I only use data mainly so I pay about 28 bucks/month.however,atrocious when you go Malaysia and try to use data. I switched to celcom as recommended by them, turned on all my data roaming on the circles life app and on my iPhone but data just doesn‚Äôt work. I had some important stuff which could have ruined my holiday but managed to resolve them because I‚Äôm resourceful. Totally horrible and I see 12.7kB of roaming so I will wait and see if they charge me $10/100mb for this."
4,"I've been a customer of Circle.Life for 1 year and 3 months now! Here are some of the things I like and dislike about it:  Connectivity: For most part of Singapore it's ok, except during a couple of occasions I've had connectivity issues while in a mall or underground (MRT) whereas my SingTel/M1 friends did not.  Customer Service: Communication with customer service is done via the Circles.Life app. Generally they have been prompt in responding on the live chat, and from past experience they are so much faster than M1 call center! Customer service officers on the other side of the live chat can troubleshoot and make changes to your account for you (for example, I chatted once to request for them to pause my plan for a few months as I was travelling overseas). One downside might be the lack of a human touch, I do miss speaking to a customer service officer over the phone. Circles.Life live chat hours are: Monday - Friday 9am to 10pm, Weekends & PH 9am to 6pm.  Mobile App: Very user friendly compared and modern design, pleasant to use!  Delivery: I remembered when I first signed up for Circles.Life, I was super excited to hear that the SIM card will be delivered to my doorstep! So you complete the process online, wait for your SIM card (along with a few freebies) to arrive, as simple as that.  Birthday treats & other bonuses: 500MB birthday bonus. When I first signed up there was also a port-in bonus, if you're switching over from another local telco. You also get referral bonus (200 MB per month for every new customer who signs up using your referral code) so there's actually no limit to the amount of bonus data you can get out of Circles.Life. Here are some of the bonuses which I have, according to the app: - Happy Birthday! (+500 MB) - Loyalty 12 months with Circles (+500MB) - Loyalty 6 months with Circles (+500MB) - Port-in (+1 GB) - App Activation (+1 GB)  Overall Value: I'm paying $28 per month for 6 GB of data, and this is not a SIM only plan (base plan still comes with 100 mins talktime) so this plan is perfect for someone like me who most makes calls, use WhatsApp for communication and generally quite heavy data user (browsing Facebook on MRT haha). I like that Circles have flexibility when you ""over-use"" data: you can choose to auto-boost (e.g. 200 MB for $2) when you're almost out of data (so you never face a situation where you're completely data-less) or switch auto-boost off and purchase additional data at different rates: unlimited ($3 per day), +2.0 GB ($10), +1.0 GB (+$6). No surprise charges!"
4,"Have been using circles life $0 plan for the past 6 months. It is very useful for people who doesn't require much data plans or if their work place and home have a WiFi. For just $10 top up, you get 200 mins outgoing and free incoming calls which is ideal for elderly that does not need much data."

4,"I moved from Singtel to Circles Life, why?  Pros of Circles:  - Good customer service from Circles, smaller companies ca actually do a better service job. You can imagine calling Singtel countless times and getting no response that you have to visit their help centre and only to find out its a waste of time lining up.  - Cheap roaming: Within asian countries and their app easily allows me to activate in minutes - Customisable plans: More data and calls, no sms needed - Earn more data through games or just remaining loyal to circles   Cons:  - Other telco providers may have more attractive phone bundles with contract, only if you're thinking of getting a new phone "
5,I just switched over from Starhub as my company has a CIS promo code with them. The entire process has been painless and smooth flowing. My number ported over with no problems and I received my new SIM card the same day I switched over. The numerous updates provided assured me that I would face no disruptions in service. Just got off the chat with customer service about some questions and they answered all of them to my utmost satisfaction. The customer service is top-notch and cell service has been excellent so far. I even got a Free Unlimited Data Add-on as a surprise bonus.
4,Very cheap plan with high volume of data usage. But the line is not that good as compare to other big telco company in the industry.
5,Circle life is one of the best telco in singapore! Offering affordable and Low rate monthly. Worth every dollars! 
4,Some issues when overseas. Online help do not understand some of the feedback at times. But it's fine for a $0 plan
5,"Loads of data at an affordable price, which is hard to come by these days. A good alternative to the other well-known telcos locally."
5,One of the best telcos in Singapore. Low rates and very affordable overseas data plans. Wouldn't hesitate to sign up another 2 years! 
5,Lot of data provided at very good rates. Coverage is ok as well. Will recommend to try out the service.
5,Easy payment! Easy to use! Able to monitor my data usages so that I will not over use it no need to worry that I overuse my dat
4,"I like how the app is very user friendly with a very clean interface which allows for easy navigation.   The fact that it provides a $10 rebate if you port over also adds value.  With regards to the connection, being from Singtel previously I feel that the connection can be improved, certain areas tend to have weak signals (I would say 10-15% of the time) not a very huge impact but I guess Singtel has a better infrastructure in place.  But in terms of overall value, I think it has more value, flexibility and competitive pricing. "
4,"It's great cause I'm a NSF now so the unlimited data is damn shiok.   Reception in certain areas are limited tho. Notably whenever I take the train from Kallang to Eunos, reception suddenly dips and everything loads really slowly."
4,"Pros: Lots of data for a really low price with the Corporate Scheme. On boarding was simple, got my Sim very quick.  Cons: Noticed some smudgy data reception at certain points on the NEL (purple line) and at Paya Lebar Quarter. "
5,"Onboarding and transition: Process was straightforward and easy, I didn‚Äôt really have to do much as the SIM card was delivered straight to your doorstep. No issues when transitioning to Circles from my previous provider.   Quality: Quality and speed of the data is surprisingly decent, even when you‚Äôre underground in the train. There are times when I still had data connection when my friends, who are with larger providers did not even have access!  App interface:  Visual dashboard which allows you to view everything at a glance. You add on what you need(roaming, data etc), and it comes into effect rather quickly. I really appreciate the lifestyle section as well which shows you upcoming activities/ concerts, if you need inspiration on what to do for the weekends.   2 years with circles now.. no major complaints really, and they reward customers with data on your birthdays, anniversary with circles etc.. which is nice. What‚Äôs more, they are the first to disrupt the industry which I really support :)"
5,"Strengths:   It has aaaaalllloottttt of data!  Like now i am having 46GB paying at $43/mth.  This amount of unlimited data allowed me to use my own Hotspot everywhere i go. Now I don't bother if that place has free wifi.  The main reason  is i can work anywhere. With my personal hotspot and all this data, i cld almost work anywhere any place as long as it is in SG.   Sometimes, when urgent matters happens, i can share my data with friends when doing research for projects and family members during our outings.  The network is actually quite stable and strong.   The customer service via email is actually better than Singtel or M1 - like if you tried before you will know how annoying it is to keep pressing menu buttons and listened until you are lost.  As busy people, i personally think circles has helped us alot.   The app is easy to use.   I didnt spend alot when i travelled to Malaysia. The roaming was within my limits (of course you have to off data roaming if it is not needed)  I have been an ex-Singtel and M1 user.  And these are the benefits i saw after switching over since 3 years ago.   Now you can find out whats happening around in SG in the app itself - buy tickets too.  Including latest movies.    Weakness:  Underground in Mrt, certain stations you may not have strong network. ( If you have to compare with Singtel) but if you are not so fussy abt it, it actually is not a big issue.   In certain periods there might be network lost, but is usually (from my own observation) 3am period.  If I can also use my existing data for roaming while overseas that will be great..  like top up a small amount for this additional function whenever in travel."
4,"I did not mind paying $30/month for CL as it had quality roaming options, vs the newer zero1, gomo, giga.  Also it had a loyalty bonus, but sadly what made me left was that they discontinued it and thus i can't justify paying more (than GOMO or GIGA) for the lesser data.  Once GIGA or GOMO haver better roaming, CL will definitely have no edge."
4,For now I'm happy with the service. Recommended  For now I'm happy with the service. Recommended  For now I'm happy with the service. Recommended   For now I'm happy with the service. Recommended 
4,"Good and affordable plans with easy setup. Customer service is also responsive and easy to deal with. However, the network can be spotty and often is slow in some areas. Overall though a good experience. Would recommend. "
4,"I applied for the corporate line for my mother. 25gb is definitely enough for her, also added the unlimited incoming calls since she still uses the phone to chit chat with her friends. ;p  Thanks to the port-in promo, there's $10 off monthly for 12mths. No issue during the porting even though I wasn't the account holder of her previous line. Reception wise, no complaints from her so far.  Overall, I think it's quite worth it! The best part is.. she no longer needs to worry about exceeding her data (simply because she's worried that I will need to pay extra).  The only pet peeve i have is the daily mail they send to my work email.. hahaha.. small issue thou.."
5,Have been with circle life for around 2 years for now. Affordable price with lots of data. Good customer support with fast response. Highly recommended 
5,Just view months I using this circle life plan.. Very good choice and I have more savings $$$ for my budget!! Love the unlimited data what I apply and my kids can watching YouTube all day long üëçüòä
5,"Love how the easily I can add on extra units of data, call minutes or smses. It's easy and fuss free to use Circles Life. "
4,"Pros:  - Value wise I think Circles.Life really has the best deal. - Connection: No issues so far. In fact, I used to be on Singtel but the connection on Circles.Life has been better than Singtel ever has for me. - Customer service is great! Very quick and friendly replies. - Porting from Singtel to Circles.Life was fuss-free, no need to physically visit a store. The SIM card gets delivered to you and activates shortly after your connection with the old telco is cut.  Cons: - New customers get the better end of the deal. I'm paying $28/month (which is actually reasonable) for the 20GB plan (everyone gets 20GB now) but the new users only pay $18/month for 20GB as well?!?!? Doesn't help that I still see their ads ALL the time ‚Äî thanks Circles.Life, just rub it in.  - there's no way to port your number out from Circle.Life so, essentially, you're stuck for LIFE if you want to keep your number ‚Äî do correct me if I'm wrong, I'd be happy to be proven otherwise. Not that I'm looking to change telcos but it's nice to have that option if I ever need to."
5,"ONBOARDING I chose Circles over another option (*ahem* starting with G..) ultimately because I was just that lazy to port my number from my previous telco. Circles provided a very seamless option whih required least effort from me.  PRICE I am overall satisfied! Main reason why I decided to switch because I was paying higher price for lesser data at my previous telco. You can potentially save a lot if you are influential and can refer people in your circle :)  APP I only login occasionally to see how much I have used and past bills. It‚Äôs easy to activate roaming if you travel often, or need to boost data on full days you‚Äôll be out on the road. App has other features such as ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù on latest event happenings, I can see how it‚Äôd be useful for entertainment seekers.   RECEPTION I think generally reasonable. Only annoyance was when I returned from JB but it took a while to switch and detect that I‚Äôm back.  Bonus Data with EZ-LINK rides I accumulated enough rides to earn extra 50MB of data. It‚Äôs pretty negligible actually "
5,Signed up with Circles Life years ago.  The best Telco ever.  I love it when i give real feedbacks in the telco community page.  They have real people managing your feedbacks.  Others should learn from Circles Life la. 
5,"Circles.Life is ridiculously good it doesn't make sense to not use it:  - Ridiculously easy and straightforward sign-up. There's no need to go to the customer service centre, press the ticket machine, sit there and wait for your queue number to be called, talk to the customer service officer who sometimes irresponsibly upsells you. All the options are displayed clearly online. What you see is what you get and the SIM card can be collected/delivered at your convenience.  - Monthly billing is hassle-free with automatic deduction option and email notification.  - Customer service is great. I had a roaming problem overseas and the customer service HUMAN actually answered me and solved my problem within a day. There's no need to listen to the pre-recorded customer service voice and press numbers or chat to a non-understanding bot.   - Finally, most importantly, the recent additional free 20 GB per month for $28 is too good to be true but it's true.  - The only downside is that the infrastructure is that of M1 which does not have the best coverage in Singapore but it is not that big a deal.  Great job Circles.Life, keep it up."
5,"Best telco with professional Customer services by using live chat, say bye to the hassle calling to their hotline and waited for ages.  They are like my friends, always there ready for the issue I face and of course the satisfied solutions.   No regret switch from Sxxhub two years ago, and will continue with this great telco, CL is the best."
5,"My experience was rather rocky as i had many issues with my previous telco . However the friendly staff were swift to help and resolve all the problems that i have faced . Moreover , the data plans offered were really affordable for a student like myself and the network until now i have no complains at all . "
4,I really like how Circles Life rewards loyal customers with data. I was getting free data on random occasions like national day too. The network is somewhat stable except when underground.
5,"I've been on circles for the past couple of months, nothing to complain about! Sign up was effortless and instant. There were constant updates on line porting and the transition was smooth. I was with red telco for all my life until my bf recommended me to circles. So far, so good! The app is also well-organized and intuitive to use. Love the UI. I don't believe in busting your bank account for data, and circles is a God send. Highly recommend! "
5,"So far the most responsive customer service......quick response and action.  Thanks to CL, it has influence other to look into the fees and allocation of data..... "
5,Circles is the best telco line I ever had. Save lots of phone bills. Love the unlimited data! Gonna recommend to family and friends. 
5,a very good choice. customer service is reliable when need help. good internet connection. bonus extra data given. the best so far i had use
3,Probably not the best teleco to use for your main line due to the unstable mobile data strength. But it is always good to have a 20gb mobile data on standby for just $18.
5,"Circles life offering best plan to the customers, they allowing customer to change their data plan according to their monthly needs monthly. Again, it‚Äôs not one month or two months, it is every month!  Circles life partnering with a lot of company throughout the years, and resulting in a lot of different interesting promotion to customers. SOme examples are EZ-Link, SP Power and etc. "
5,Been using  for almost 2 years and now im happily enjoying my free gb every month. Its awesome and cheaper. 
3,"In app service is bad as always disconnect after awhile and I‚Äôll have to repeat my questions all over again.   Always charge me for additional usage when I didn‚Äôt even exceed = having to speak to the customer service to waive.  Besides these, everything is good. "
5,Greatly love circles life because I always pay the minimum to get a lot of data. Customer service is also always available online. Better than those line with barely calling platforms for customer enquiries. 
5,"hassle free. Affordable and good. gives a good coverage when roaming. does not have any issue when using overseas. when there is technical issue, helpline is just thru facebook messenger."
5,"Affordable and good connection! If you feel that you gonna exceed data/sms etc, you can just topup on the spot for just a few dollars. Worth it!"
5,Easy registration and very fast sim card delivery. Enquiries answered very promptly. Recommend for everyone! 
5,Circles.Life is the best telco i ever used... The data they bundled and give out occasionally are really great.... Never have i ever ran out of data. They also listen to consumer suggestions. 
5,Circle life is the best.. No need to worry about short of data. And monthly bill are way more cheaper compare to other telco.  
5,Great service! Seriously love the Promo event they just made! FREE ULTIMATED DATA! Truly amazing and fantastic! Would love to see another event like this in the future! 
5,I have been using for almost 3 yrs now. Cashless and easy access to check my bills and monitoring my data. Hustle free apps. Prompt replies when needed for verification through the chat. Never regret using circle life
5,Awesome app for both circles and non circles subscribers. Not only does it provide telco functionality  but also serves as a platform that facilitates tracking of current movies listing 
4,Good network coverage locally. Better then many service providers that offer no contract data plan. Would like to see more effort in overseas coverage. Prefer ability of bring data locally to overseas (similar to M1)  
4,Online application was very easy and delivery the next day was fast. Price is affordable to suit the needs as compared to previous bill which costs almost hundred dollars. Thumbs up!
5,Well I have been using circle life for past 3 year. So I feel you are the best telco ever. Users would appreciate if handset could be purchased using debit card whereby payment mode in installment plan. 
5,"The flexibility Circles.Life offers will complement all lifestyles that we are living right now. From a working adult to school children, it comprehends to what is needed. They also give what is good to have with the loyalty programme. Most importantly, the support rendered to their customers are one of the best so far i have encountered. "
5,"4.5 stars. Responsive customer service, regular promotions on the app and customisable plans. Love the referral system as well. Only issue: Minus 0.5 stars for poor reception in circle line."
5,"Best telco all time, been 3 year contract with cirlce no hidden charge. Since first lauch  circle just simple base plan, no unlimited outgoing call.  My first bill was expensive around 120  for few month with the date just 5 gb, they keep update the app, promote new stuff for us ,they addec in unlimited outgoing call n 20 dollar for 20 gb , Now my bill from 120 to 54 per month.  Worth for us monthly bill  Got bonus Gb they have everything,how to earn free gb by vote a poll..  I will recommed my fren with circle"
5,Value for money.Therre is an apps to monitor your ussage and customised your plan as and  when you like to change. and paperless bill. 
5,2yrs in with Circles and I have no regret at all with the network. The recent free unlimited data was really appreciated too.  The only things I hope they can look into is a better bundle or price for international roaming 
5,I‚Äôm a huge fan! I love the customer service. The sign up process is extremely easy and the data bonuses are all so amazing. Well priced too
1,"Yes please avoid it. As much as it looks Super tempting and attractive, but it will only make you happy for just 2-3 months. They‚Äôll make you feel it‚Äôs never enough even for 25GB/month for these few months. Once you‚Äôve gotten used to it, you realised that you have actually exceeded. When you‚Äôve been surfing the net same as the first 2-3 months. But this time you will realise you have finish 25GB  a week before the cut off date. PLEASE PLEASE AVOID. "
5,"Before I started my plan with Circles, I was with one of the three Telco giants in SG (I think you know which one I'm talking about). The two benefits I got were Unlimited SMS and a +1GB data on top of my 3GB while paying $40+ per month if I didn't exceed my data usage. I've always felt that they didn't understood my needs and benefits weren't even benefits at all.  One day, my cousin introduced me to Circles and my life changed FOREVER! Free data for answering polls, free data for porting over your number, free data for this free data for that?! And I'm only paying $28 per month (it was a significant amount of money for a then-student like me)! They have solid referral systems as well and the app is so convenient. You can tailor to your needs and wants anytime anywhere and switch it back if you dont need it the next month.  So yes, Circles is highly recommended! Loyal supporter since 1st September 2017 (almost 2 years anniversary with them)!   PICK ME SEEDLY, BEEN FOLLOWING YOU AND PARTICIPATING IN YOUR FUN GIVEAWAYS FOR AWHILE TOO!!! "
5,"network cover all the places, stable, new sign up get better benefit thn existing user, overall all good, "
4,"Switching over from singtel to circles line really saved $$$$ from my pocket! The bills are automatically deducted directly from my credit card every month, which saves me the hassle of going to AXS to pay. "
5,"Simply amazing. The unlimited data at an affordable price is what most other TELCOM could not offer. Circles.Life allows me to be stress-free when comes to data bills as I use most of my data on WAZE, GPS, etc , everyday. "
5,"Great customer service, really helped me find what I was looking for. The prices were reasonable and am sticking to them! "
5,Best telco ever. I only joined recently about 7months and I‚Äôm glad I did. Application was fast and the customer service was prompt every time I need help. Sometimes even wee hours in the morning. 
4,"Other than the fact that you cannot exceed your 20GB, there‚Äôs nothing else that I dislike about Circles.Life. (:"
5,Very good deal. Smooth service with great monthly plan !! Never regret to join it! It also comes with occasional special deal with other famous company and offer even better discounts!
5,"I was using M1 previously as my main. However, the data given was not enough for me to sustain a month. It is quite expensive if wanting to top up for extra data. Since circle life was introduced, I signed it up to try as circle life is giving away $20 for 20GB which is worth for me since I am a large user of data. Circle life is a good option if you are actually using full tonnes of data in a month. With a base plan of 20GB and add up a $20 for another 20, total of 40GB a month is quite sustainable and the price each month is not as heavy as I think. Hence, I think that circle life is a good option to have if you are using a large amount of data."
4,Circles is good because they build a community where people can share (earn data through referrals) and interact (polls and events). They value their customers. One suggestion I would make though is to make the price more appealing as competitors are now offering more with a cheaper price. 
4,"So far i've been using circle life, it was a pleasant and smooth journey where it doesn't create any problems when I'm accessing to it.  It is quite flexible and easy to understand.  "
4,"The registration procedure is fast and easy, I managed to complete it in just a few minutes and I was able to pick my sim up in less then a few hours. Was welcomed with a free month of unlimited data, much appreciated. Connectivity is great almost anywhere downtown, but is not that good in some peripheral area (e.g. NTU). Definitely worth for the price. Only negative aspect is that at the second renewal, I had no way to disable the unlimited data add on, the button for me appeared in the app only the day after the renewal. Since it was a welcome gift, I expected this not to be in auto renewal."
5,"Circles life has not only safe my pocket but it‚Äôs coverage is beyond. I work in Singapore waters, while others struggle with their network I still have 4G ;)"
5,Very smooth port over. Been using it for 2 months now and there was no problem using in trains. Using data as much as I want without having to worry about the bill. 5 Stars 
5,Hands down best mobile plan for price to data ratio amongst the telco plans in SG. Quality cust svc too #noragrets 
5,The first telco with no contract and the best ever..been on this telco for 3yrs and more and get more bonuses. Its a truly recommended no contract telco..
5,"I recommend using Circles a lot. It is so worth it. The few perks as compared to other telcos are :   (1) Time   In circles, everything is instant.  You just need your debit card, and That's it. You wait for your sim card.   (2) Contract-free and no chance of burning your data.   If you think that you are going overseas or anything that makes you want to cancel your sim, you just do it instantly with no extra fees.    I'm using the 20gb for $20 plan, I never burst my data, and even if I did, i wont get charge any extra without notification.  So there's now eay there will be an excuse that  "" I'm getting charged more as I used more than my data limit"""
5,"I was initially a little apprehensive as Circles life did not have a physical store. Despite that, their online services were top notch. For instance, I was constantly updated on the delivery status of my SIM card via sms. Even when they were unable to locate my actual address, they tried contacting me. On top of that, their online messaging system was efficient and their staff readily made themselves available in case I needed help. Prices are excellent and reasonable with freebies such as unlimited data dangling from time to time. I also like how instructions were concise and lengthy terms and conditions were minimised. Despite not being tied down to a contract, I think I‚Äôd stay with Circleslife  for quite some time."
4,"Switched over to circles life because I had issues of overcharging from S Telco. And I heard from my friends that circles life is only $50 with 26gb! I needed more data so I switch over. Never did I expect the plan to be so affordable, every month not exceeding a hundred anymore. And now I even get unlimited data to surf. I could even port over my old number!"
5,"The sign up process was fuss-free and immediate. Having received the sim card within days was amazing. No more having to queue extremely long hours just for a new phone/sim card. The signal is also way better than my previous telco, leaving me with no complaints at all. They‚Äôre also generous with giveaways and discounts and I see their efforts in engaging with customers which is really commendable in an industry which just asks you to sign up for their plans. Good job Circles! üëçüèº"
5,"I'm a circle user, really love it.   Know it when they were at jurong for event. Good deal and I got myself a line & always have great promotion.  Monthly bills was cheap &with alot of GB for me to use when I'm outside with kids. "
5,"Registration, changing telecom, receiving circles life sim card can all be done within 24hrs! It's super convenient and their plans are unconventionally cheaper to the others. Moreover, there's no major issue with the networking connections! Definitely the best plan for anyone to have these days! "
5,Circles life is handsdown the best telco and has great customer service that beats any other telco. No way any other telco can compete with providing pro customer plans as well as prompt customer service
5,"Been using it for 2 years plus. Application process is simple... Got the sim card the next day. Always full of surprises.. Customise data, mins, sms etc is much better then standard telco offering"
4,"Had some initial hiccups while porting over from starhub, as the circles cust care reps were unable to properly advise on the phone setting changes needed to detect the virtual mobile network. However after that, it has been all smooth sailing. Impressed with how flexibility is in the hands of the user, via the app. Very happy with my billing. No issues with network too. Recommended."
5,"i dont have to worried about my data exceeding its limit as now my data is unlimited.i can even share hotspots with my friends.the signal is great even underground.well,i work long hours and rarely have wifi so circles really make my life worry free...and circles do give free data too "
5,Always have free data. Circles apps is user friendly. Ive been using it for almost 2 years. No complaint so far. Now with overseas data is even more awesome. Add ons are easy.  Awesome la. 
5,"Extremely smooth process and great benefits! I have 22.5 gb of data every month at 28 dollars, what a steal!"
5,Love it. Unlimited data for a week. Only paying 1/3 of what I paid for with my previous Telco. Willingly paid my termination fee with previous Telco just to join circles. 
5,"Very smooth transaction. Porting was an ease Using circles life for 2 years now, have recommend my family circles "
5,"Really good & affordable for alot of data a month ~ app makes it easier to track data usage, navigate & add on stuff. Ever since i ported my number over from another telco, my internet speed was always smooth and fast without much disruptions.  Would really recommend to my friends and family to change to as the changing process was easy to understand and apply for. "
5,"Been using Circles Life since they just open, since they still offer numbers starting with ‚Äú8742‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt regret. Saved so much money!"
5,"Circle life is the best telecom that I have ever used, 10/10 customer service, affordable and definitely giving user a great and positive experiences have been with them with years!:)"
4,A very attractive mobile and data plan with regular promotion that keep customers attached with surprises
5,"Application was seamless, really impressed with their customer service who answered my queries with clear explanation and excellent interpersonal skills. Really happy with the data bonuses every now and then and that I saved quite a bit as compared to when I was still in binding ""slave contract"" with the previous telco üòâ"
5,Is a great tele company. Especially the customer service team giving a excellent service. They reply fast and polite and trying their best to slove the problem  u facing. 
5,"I am someone who value efficiency and convenience and I really love how Circles.Life managed everything through its app.   The functions within the app is always in good working condition. Options inside are great and clear as well. Providing a lot of information and autonomy, everything I need to know about my usage, plan and if needed I can just click on any add-ons that I require. Very convenient and transparent! This is something I valued a lot.  On top of everything, the pricing of the plans is great and comparable to the other telecos. Circles.Life, kudos and thank you!!"
5,Circles.Life offers great plans! Using their 1 GB $0 flat plan and it was absolutely fuss free.  they took care of everything.
5,all my immediate family are using circles.. it's great. the service and offer are to die for. been using them for almost 6 month and counting.  unlimited data with 300 mins outgoing calls. ü•∞
5,The day I buy circle life..worth every penny I pay ..just need bank account and live chat to the circle life..any prob they help ASAP ..I lost my sin card in overseas and chat with them the next following day I get a new SIM card with the same number ..TOP up data easy ..circle life data worth and cheap ..get free data for National Day for 9 days what else we need ..what ever they doing it pleases the customer..kudos to circle life 
5,Quick process with great deal. I don‚Äôt think you will ever find such great deals in Singapore. 20GB for $28 is what i need. 
5,I have saved a lot of money ever since I sign up for Circles.Life as my main Telco for my mobile phone; have never regretted my decisions ever since. Keep up the good work üëç
5,"good customer service, prompt replies and follow up done! connection is good and only 1/3 of my old usual bill! ;-)"
5,"Cheapest in market, with user friendly apps, recommended to heavy user data, even roaming data is cheap, just use in Philippine, $8 per 1GB, which is very affordable..greayly recommended.. "
5,"Love their seamless process of switching telco. I get their sum card mailed to me, and also get to enjoy paying a reasonable price monthly for my telco plan. "
5,"APPLICATION and/or ADDITIONAL SIM?  Application process via online is relatively easy with only 2 items required (phone and credit card). New sim arrived on the next day‚Äôs afternoon. Smooth. Thinking of getting additional sim for work related purpose? Look no further, their 1GB $0 flat plan is absolutely worth it. Considering the fact that you have data + free data, tethering connection to second line is still super worth it. Also, Circle Life allows me to adjust my data plan according to my monthly needs. Do you smell the freedom like i do ?   Connection strength? Undoubtedly, this telco connection impressed me. Whilst travelling regardless of in tunnel or at camp sites, there isn‚Äôt a significant drop in the connection signal as compared to my previous telco (not pointing fingers). PUBG definitely require good connection signal.   Other than the above mentioned. For $28/month without contract, I gotten additional 2GB data/month free from porting over and additional 0.5GB data/month free from staying loyal to them. In summary, this is EXTREMELY worth it. "
5,"The port over process was really easy! Circles life does it for you so you don't have to contact your telco yourself. They deliver the new sim card to ur house, and guide you through the process with instructions.   Everything is also done on the circles life app, you can see your bills, usage, and can add on additional data/call/msgs with a click of a button. They also have a bonus page where you can participate in polls to win additional data. I won around 1GB in two weeks.   Really a good deal."
5,"Pay less with more data or unlimited data than other telecom that I know or used before. What a awesome telecom this is, didn't regret at all."
5,Most affordable and effective way to have unlimited data! Our whole family have switched to Cirlcles.
5,Circle life has allowed me to save money on my telco plan allowing me to have extra money to be able to spend on things I prefer .
5,It was an easy breezy application process and so far Circles has been awesome. love the Poll to get free data.
5,Service has been great so far. With constant free data plan to loyal exisiting customers :) very convenient to check my data balance/usage via their app as well. Would highly recommend it to people who wants to have the flexibility and control over their own plans with no contract!
5,Signed up for circles life for my Dad and he is super happy . Low bills every month and so many perks
5,Value for money plan especially with CIS. The app is easy to use with all the additional cost and options clearly stated.    
5,"Circles.Life has brought value to us customers as the previous telcos like singtel, StarHub & m1 overlooked. Circles.Life was the genesis of a telco that required no contracts. It allowed us consumers to ‚Äúdecide‚Äù the amount of data we consume. They come up with Creative ideas on how to retain us customers by issuing loyal customers extra data‚Äôs for the month. Which is a we win situation as data in the current era is considered a necessity for us millennials we consume tons of data. They are thoughtful as they came up with plans that provide consumers ‚Äúunlimited data‚Äù at a price of $20 which is really valued as the anchor was over a $100 ~ $200 per month for the other telcos. Personally I for one would recommend anyone in my social circle to use it. As it really brings allot of value to consumers. "
5,"Have been using circles life for sometime now, switched from another telco and paid the early termination fee, never regret since , circles life has no contact and provided the best telco experience !!! Fast delivery of SIM card that I don‚Äôt even have to leave the house, the rates are Super attractive with referral bonus and promo codes, no need worry about roaming when overseas and lots of info in the ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù section for weekend activities! Things never get boring with circles life ! "
5,Customer service is fast. They helped me when i had problem logging in into my account. No contract and a customisable plan is a Big Plus!
4,"Application Process was one of the easiest I‚Äôve experience, filling a short form of details and you receive your SIM card within a week. Network Connection isn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs been improving since the first day. Honestly, how bad can connectivity be in Singapore? Customer Service is literally the best, not only in the Telco area, but also throughout my life experiences with CS. Your questions were promptly answered, things are solved almost always within 3 working days, at most 1 week. Value for money, 4/5. If you can live with average connectivity, CL is the way to go."
5,Is very fast and does not deduct ur data on.whatsapp nice service and really affordable.So if you are on.a budget this.is a plan.to look for
5,"Nice customer service, application process is smooth. It‚Äôs so helpful for people who wants to cut down their expenses because they have verygood offer for data plans "
4,"Application online is fast and nice .   Very good customer support on Facebook !   But only issues . No mailing / Cash Monthly Payments services and very poor underground service signals .   When in call , VOLTE will turn Data speed to VERY Slow Response . Then make user have to end the ""Normal Call "" to use Data again .   But other than that , service are quick and not an issues . Cheaper Plands can still be introduced ! "
5,Circles.Life is the most awesome telco ever. Better than starhub and singtel in all ways. Cheapest mobile plan in Singapore. Always comes up with new promo. 
5,"Best online mobile service provider, I say. Strong connection, comprehensive plans, unlimited data. All at value for money prices. What more can you ask for? "
4,"I used CL from October 2018 for 10 months. The things I like: 1) competitive subscription package; 2) wonderful customer service; 3) comfortable mobile app user experience; 4) bonus. They offer extra data for friend referral, daily poll and ezlink partnership and many other promotions; 5) a lot of new perks in mobile apps yet to explore... The things I dislike, also why i switched out. Like all other telco, their strategy is to bring more new customer, however, they dont take too much care for retaining existing users. At some point, i decided to switch to gomo for cheaper plan."
5,"APPLICATION PROCESS  The application process was really smooth. I just need my phone and my bank card ready. Applied online and waited for my new sim to arrive. It actually arrived next day despite applying on a Sunday afternoon!  CONNECTION IN MRT I travelled the red line daily, played Mobile Legend while on train, didn't experience much of a connection drop as compared to my previous telco. Signal in underground is pretty strong and fast, but definitely not as good as above the ground.   PRICE As I've ported in from other telco, I get an additional 2GB/month free. For only $28/month! With no contract somemore. Many other telco are starting to offer SIM-ONLY plans, but the reason to stay with Circle is because they offer 500MB/month for every 6 months staying with them. Meaning that, in ur 2 years contract with other telco, I'll be getting additional 2GB/month free for staying with Circle. "
5,It is a great service provider. I get sufficient data with no lagging. The staff are also very nice and helpful when I asks questions when applying for the line. 
4,"First entity to disrupt the telco market! Live chat, good customer service, awesome fb group for insiders makes me stay, Although new mnvos and telco offerings has become more competitive and lower priced than Circles Life, will still stay with circles for sometime because circles once liberated me from choosing between 3 slow ineffective traditional telcos that are more monopolistic than competitive."
5,"was previously on circles life for about a year before switching over to üåü - telco, because of the better price offered ü§≠ Am now back with circles life because it is back with bigger and better deals to offer!"
5,"I joined Circles when I realised that I was missing out on so much more at a lower cost. Compared to my previous provider which charges me 9gb of data, 1000mins talktime and 1000sms at $62.90 (I dont even use the call & sms), I got 26gb of data at $48! (Now its 43gb!) Porting was even smoother than ever! It was quick and hassle free and I‚Äôve managed to do it and cancel my plan w the previous telco within a week! Now I totally didn‚Äôt regret changing to Circles!"
5,"Application Process: It is really easy to apply! Everything is basically done online and the SIM card gets mailed to you after that. No need to go anywhere and queue up just to apply for a plan.  Network Connection: Network connection has been great so far. Sometimes while I'm at home using the house wifi and the connection is bad, i switch to 4G immediately to play mobile legends, to surf social media etc. Only down side is maybe some areas (like my office) has bad connection indoors but that's fine, the connection outdoors has been pretty great thus far.  Customer Service: Contacted customer service via Facebook messenger with some queries when I'm not sure about some stuff. Reply is almost immediate if not just a short wait. The staff replying is also friendly.  Value-for-money: I'd say I never regret switching over to circles life. On top of the very affordable base plan of $28/month for 20GB, there are loyalty bonuses, collaboration with ezlink, and also random bonus data given out every now and then. "
4,"When I was signing up for their 20gb plan, it was near the end of the month. I received the sim card before the month end but only inserted it into my phone at the start of the next month. Turns out, they apply the add on for unlimited data by default, and because i didnt turn it off before my first month end, I was charged an extra $20 for the add on. Wasn't able to get it waived off despite writing to them about my situation.  Other than this mishap at the beginning of my plan, everything is good. The app makes it really convenient for me to track my usage. The connection not very strong at more secluded area, but not a big issue for me."
5,"I don't look much in a Telco. As long as they give me what they promise and don't overcharge me, I'm more than happy. But not only had Circles Life met that standard, they top it off by having amazing customer service and community management team. And that's a rarity in Telcos that sets Circles apart from the rest"
4,"Signed up for the $0 Flexi Plan. Only grouse is that they bill their data in 1 min block ""Local voice services are chargeable on a one (1) minute pulse basis for the first minute"", which meant that if you took 30 calls in which you only said ""hello"", that would be 30 mins of talktime."
5,Circles.Life is my favourite service provider so far! Mobile plans offered are flexible and non-binding. One point that everyone loves is the never-ending treats of free data during festivals and birthdays. 
5,"Amazing telco. I love that they celebrate special events like National Day with free unlimited data and they have bonuses where you do a poll and you can receive +20MB of data each poll. This is why I love this telco, I can never run out of data with Circles.Life. I love Circles.Life. Circles.Life is love, Circles.Life is life. Haha, hope to win this $50 Grab Credits. Thanks"
3,"I applied for Circles Life in July 2017 after moving back from Australia. So no portover benefits for me. Also back then, no similar competition in SG, unlike now.   I liked Circles Life then because firstly, I am a data-mainly user, limited user of calls and sms. So it offered the best value among the telcos for the data amount I could get.  The application process back then was straightforward online, maybe 3 steps process? First, identification, then choose your number, then pay-up and delivery arrangements. Sim card package delivered next day - impressive!  The reception has been mainly good in most places. Perhaps in certain public toilets (very old buildings with poor telecoms anyway), the reception can be sketchy. Cannot remember exact places off the top of my head.  Additional benefit I use is linkage of account to Ez-link, 10 rides per week get 50mb. This data allowance accumulates for life (or as long as u stay with Circles Life) and ride count resets every week. So far, I have accumulated 2GB-ish additional allowance on top of monthly 20GB allowance. So that's total of 22GB-ish of data to use per month.  Other benefits are the regular lucky draws, festive promos similar to any other e-commerce companies.  What got me not so happy lately with Circles Life, was in the bid to compete with Singtel GOMO (most similar competition), they started a promo for new sign-ups. But did not give loyal existing customers the same benefit. I continued to pay $10 additional per month compared to new sign-ups. This is $120 additional per year - not an insignificant amount to me.   Porting over to Singtel GOMO remains strong on my mind. But what holds me back is the porting over process that GOMO has not have good reviews. Apparently porting over a number can take a few days to happen, which I cannot afford to have with work.   So if you are a new sign-up or porting over - go for it. Circles is a good deal. Fortunately, you are not me. "
5,"I've been using Circle Life for 2years and many years more to come because I love all the offer that was given to me I receive free birthday GB,  NDP/Free data Monthly bonus andaandanu more... My bills was prompt according and just love  it... "
5,"I was stuck with ""one of Singapore's main telcos"" for many years with overpriced phone plans that were inflexible, with poor customer service to boot.   Circles.Life rocked the nation with its no-contract, huge-data plans with very good and responsive customer service.   Not to mention Circles is also very responsive to customer feedback. Want more benefits for long-time customers? You got it. 20GB for free! Free unlimited data over National Day 2019!   Want affordable big-GB roaming plans, done!  I've stuck with Circles.Life with nary a single complaint and always a smile on my face, rocking 40+ GB of data each month for less than a price of a decent restaurant meal. "
5,Been with circles since 2017 till date . Love the loyalty data and prompt response from the support team via Facebook messenger. 
5,For past tree year I'm using circle life telko experience was so good and so far cheaper telko I'm bean pay for. Line so far so smooth Don any problems. if any doubt the staft wiling to assist with give thumb üëç üëç üëç up for circle life we lave you üòä 
5,"Easy , hassle free, great deals , cheap data plan and most importantly NO CONTRACT! Can even port in existing phone number too! "
5,I lik circle life a lot .. cos they have gd service.. I intro many my Friend to use it ready.. I also have intro my Wife for using tis line too.. she nw using it so far so gd ... 
5,"So far so good with circles life. i've been with circles for almost 4months now and everything is superb. They have a very transparent billing so expect no hidden charges at all, you pay what you get from them.  Also their customer service is the best since you can contact then anytime and anywhere! Looking forward to more years with circles life!"
5,Circles never fail to surprise its customer with great deals like free data and events. It has a strong customer support team that is always ready to help its customer. One thing i like about its after sales service is that i do not need to call a number and listen to an automated voice asking me to press lots of number and still have to wait for 10-20 mins before a customer service officer picks up. I strongly recommend people to give circles a try.
5,"Firstly, the application process is really smooth. I got my phone and plan done within 30mins?  The service of the staff is really phenomenal. They are so efficient and patient.  All in all, I really love the service that they provide, the flexibility you have in your own phone plans (add-ons). "
5,"Going on my 3rd year on Circles.Life, everything smooth, and always got fast response from the customer service when I have a question.   Network is fine and coverage is very good, no problem with no signal wherever I go (well, except for elevators perhaps), and have no complaints! The value for money id awesome, paying about $30 a month for 20GB+ data (bonus), including few texts and unlimited incoming call. The plan is so very flexible and customizable that there is always the perfect plan for everyone.   The new roaming plan is not bad too, can buy one to few days of data to use for a JB or short overseas trip!   Generally happy and recommended. Tempted to try out other new Virtual Network operators offered by bigger telco, but can't be bothered to change line and register new since I am in good position with Circles.Life :)"
5,"Signed up with Circles back when they were offering 3GB + bonus 2GB. Now they automatically upgrade everyone to 20GB. Besides that they continuously look at ways to reward their customers & constantly innovate, so much so the big 3 have to copy them in putting customers first instead of profits.  No teething issues since the day I joined. Good job!"
5,Application process was very smooth! I have been with CL more than 2yrs (i think). Happy with their support. Basically not much complain on their network infrastructure because i was from M1. :) Recently i jio my gf to join CL because it was cheap for the first year! Haha.
5,I was skeptical when Circles first went in the Telco Market.. however i decided to give them a try..  Now i am a CiclesLife user for 2 years and there is never a day i regret the decision to sign with them. Process..biling are fuss free..i nve had any major distruption to the connections. I have recommended to friends and family.. i proudly showed them my simplifed bill on how much i could save my money.  CirclesLife is a value for money telco and i love it.  To me its 10/10.
5,"Circle Life has been a fuss-free telco. Prompt with responsive service. It is also value for money. Best is that there is no contract which gives us consumer the flexibility to change to another telco anytime.  To be honest, I have been with circle life for almost 2 years now and I have no problem with overcharging bills. It has been very easy checking the status of usage on their circle life app. I will recommend 100% to all my friends and family and even you reading this, to Circle Life :)   The only 1 downside is that overseas usage can be quite expensive. So it is not advisable to roam. However, for Singapore usage, it is excellent with the connection!"
5,"Easy setup with the SIM card and best of all, cost-effective as compared to the other telcos. They also offer many giveaways and extra data!  Very friendly customer service as well, answering all my enquiries so far.  10/10 highly recommend! "
5,"Connection: 4.5/5  No major issues at all. Have another SIM with another telco and Circles is actually better.   Price: 5/5 Bill for the past 3 months:  May: $34.88 Jun: $39.28 Jul: $29.84 (With my previous telco, $80++/month was a norm)   Customer Service: 4.5/5  Simple request for assistance on their app gets immediate response. No long waiting on the line.   Roaming: 5/5  Cheap Plans at just $5 for 1 GB to neighbouring countries like Malaysia, Indonesia etc.  Save the hassle of buying SIM card when arriving at that country.  Just activate on your App.  I actually had a problem with this when I was in Indonesia a few months back, where they didn't activate the Boost I bought, a few text to customer service on their app and my refund was done almost immediately.    A few additional benefits to take note:  - FREE unlimited whatsapp  - Top up just $2 per month to get unlimited incoming. Just did this and you can see my bill for Jul is already lower by $5-$10  - LOADS of data to use no no worries about that   Overall: 5/5  If you are looking for Simple, Cheap, No strings attached without having to worry about about Data,  Circles.Life is definitely the one.    "
5,"Always great, no regrets for switching telco 3+ years back! Thanks for the constant engagement with customers like myself; the voting, giveaways, content creation etc! Cant wait to watch Circles expand and grow huge!"
5,"Fast approval, one of the cheapest plan at $18 (1year promo only), also great coverage. Coverage include underground MRT, but somehow sometimes at home do not have good coverage (I live on the 2nd floor)."
4,"Switching Telcos: Truly excellent, seamless service to switch over (from Singtel). Pick up of the SIM card was super easy from my nearest post office (but you can get it mailed as well)  Daily Usage and Coverage: Pretty happy with coverage so far. Data connectivity is good though basements are a bit iffy, which is expected. MRT coverage is fine.   Amount of data and value for money: Top reason I switched over - such great value, I don't need to stress anymore about hotspotting for work, which I have to do a lot. And I can download as much as I need for leisure as well.   Roaming: In Southeast Asia the rates have been fine, especially for how much I travel for work regionally. However, in a recent emergency I got stranded overseas. I needed to use my data unexpectedly in China to make calls, and got hit with $100 of charges for less than an hour of roaming and two whatsapp phone calls of <5 mins. In such a situation I wish that I could use roaming overseas for a day without having to worry about that on top of the stress of being stranded and having to inform my family.  Overall: really happy with it day to day in Singapore, but am not a fan of the roaming rate uncertainty. Would recommend to anyone who isn't a frequent traveller outside of SEA. "
5,"I changed my line from other telco to Circle telco since December 2017 and it changed my consumption. I used to used $50+/month for 3gb data. When i changed to circle, i can control my data usage within the app in my phone. I like the option to go unlimited with $3/day, i used it during high data usage.  For me, i think Circle is the best choice for telco right now because it gave you the freedom to choose your own plan.  The speed it not great compared to big telco, but for me it is still acceptable.  Thank you Circle."
4,"With Circles, I don't even connect to the Wifi at home now! The data allowance is great, and the price is very affordable.   There are some areas with limited connectivity, e.g. underground areas, in some buildings, but I will still choose Circles because of the amazing data plan.   The customer service team is also awesome. I have encountered a few issues with billing and the promotions, but the team resolve the issue fast and were very polite.  One improvement that I have seen is the data roaming boost, whereby you pay $5 or $8 for 1 GB of data to selected countries (which some other telcos are also offering). This is good as there is no need to purchase a local sim card. Hopefully more countries will be included in the near future, and more improvements will be made along the way!"
5,"Of the most seamless and easy telco in terms of signing up. One can get going in less than 15 minutes - a fantastic feat compared to the long waiting times of the traditional players. As the networks rides on M1‚Äôs infrastructure - reliability and speed isn‚Äôt an issue. As for customer service, the mobile app covers most of the bases, and personally, this is a major plus point for me. In this day and age where time is a premium, finding the time to visit a telco outlet is almost impossible. And this is where Circles.Life have done well by bringing the customer service to their customers instead of the traditional model, and saving them operating  costs on which they pass the savings to their customers in the form of generous data allocations. I‚Äôm happy with Circles.Life and for those who have their hesitations, I‚Äôd recommend them to try the $0 plan to see what a spectacular ride they‚Äôre in for with Circles.Life! "
5,"Circles.Life is famous for its adaptability to pricing changes, as well as pushing out initiatives for innovative and new pricing structures/ use cases. Therefore, on this front, it's actually pretty similar to other telecoms in the market since it has to remain competitive.  What truly sets them apart, however, is its customer service. Nowhere else (and I have subscribed to almost all, if not all, of the providers) have I experienced better customer service, in terms of friendliness, helpfulness, promptness and transparency. In fact, this is the only factor that keeps me loyal to the brand, and even if some of its plans one should become more expensive than its competitors, I would remain a CL customer, just because I am confident that they would make my user experience a buttery smooth one."
5,"Love the plans that they offer, after I signed up with them, I never had to worry about Data. What I like most about Circles.Life is that they are more than just a telco, all the surprises they have and all that little details they do for customers. Really recommend them."
3,"Works fine in Singapore with value for data but it gives you a hard time overseas especially in Australia, London, and India. "
4,"application process :  it was a smooth process, i signed up in less than 15 minutes. i ported my number from starhub to circles life, and i expected more tedious process since i had to cancel my starhub plan. but surprisingly, circles life managed to port my number in after 3 days without me even lifting a finger! i was really impressed with the efficiency that they work with, considering that i also received my new circles life sim card the next day after signing up(on a saturday!).   network connection : comparing circles life to starhub, i feel that the connection varies a lot and keeps going from 3 bars to 4 bars and then back to 3 bars, depending on where i go. i‚Äôm also not the kind to keep checking on my signal, but i realized from the few times i‚Äôve observed, the signal in lifts is quite strong and doesn‚Äôt go to 1 bar or 0 bar like starhub. i think it even works well in underground mrt tunnels!   value for money : hella cheap, i got the 20gb for $28. on top of that, i ported my number from starhub to circles life and thus i got a $120 cashback in the form of a $10 rebate for the next 12 months of payment.  i mean yes, the connection thing might make me frustrated at times, but i get 20GB per month for only $28 unlike my starhub plan which gave me 6GB for $60+ per month plus additional $20 for an extra GB coz i keep bursting every month.  they also offer the unlimited data bundle at $20/mth, unlimited incoming calls at $2/mth, and unlimited outgoing calls at $8/mth. you can even customise your data plans all from your phone which is quite worth it in my opinion as you pay for what you use.   additional benefits : circles life is actually quite generous with data. they have this poll section in the app where everyone votes and  the results come out the next day. when you have chosen the winning selection(the one with most votes), they give you 20MB i believe? i‚Äôve earned like 0.8GB already, and i only joined on Aug 2019?? however, the bonus data only accumulates and expires by the end of the month. i won‚Äôt complain though. for someone who may have burst their data, this bonus would be a life saver!   overall : i will be observing how circles life works out for me for the next 11 more months, and then decide again if i should move on to another telco or stay with circles life. so far, i‚Äôm thinking of staying for the good benefits! but that‚Äôs also the good thing about circles life - there is no contract! if you tried it and you don‚Äôt like it, you can just move on to the next telco with no hassle!    "
5,"APPLICATION PROCESS I actually applied through a roadshow instead of the usual online application. The process from start to finish took only about 10 minutes and the employee handling the sign up process was friendly and helped me fill in everything and handed me the sim card after everything was done  CONNECTION I travel on the green line daily and never had problem streaming videos and other applications.   PRICE  I can't say much about the price compared to other telcos as I'm an expat and this is my first choice as telco provider. Overall compared to my native country, 28 SGD for 20GB per month is very cheap and you get 50mb free if you pair the app with your ezlink card for every 10 trips taken. It's not much but it's nice to get extra data  CUSTOMER SERVICE I've had to email the customer service a couple of times due to some typo in my bill. They're always helpful and friendly and will suggest alternative solutions if the current one is not workable which shows that they definitely care. I remember some of them replied on weekends as well. All in all very good experience"
4,"Going for the unlimited plan as $48 for unlimited seems a good deal to me and every 6 months i get 500MB data free,A go to for data heavy users."
5,Awesome staffs and awesome surprises. Full of good things like free data and awesome referral programs! Highly recommended! 
4,"The application to switch from Singtel to Circles was painless. Have been using Circles for about close to two years. Plan and pricing is competitive and offers plenty of customisation options. Their seasonal promotions, such as the National day free data promotion and other seasonal promotions are always a surprise and a wow factor.  The only downside is that Circles sometimes has spotty 4G connection and it you experience an outage on a weekend, there's no call center that you can reach as you can only reach them on weekdays.   Otherwise an affordable and competitive service provider that ticks all the boxes and provides occasional wow (in appreciation) moments. "
5,"Super simple application process, Circles make it very easy to handle the porting of old numbers from prior telcos.   In terms of the reliability, I've not had major issues with the data and reception around Singapore. Works as reliably as any of the other incumbent telcos in Singapore.   Their customer support is also very responsive, answering my queries and worries in a timely and kind manner. "
5,"Very user friendly app user interface. Data management is a breeze as one is able to tailor the amount of data purchased according to their monthly consumption, thus not forced to pay exorbitant prices. I would highly recommend Circles Life to everyone out there "
5,"What else can u ask for, free data for answering poll. No need exercise. And circles have constantly be in the forefront of coming out ideas to give to the customers!!!!! "
5,"The Circles.Life app that is used to manage our plan is really user-friendly and easy to navigate around. The customer service replies to help/queries in-app almost immediately. Moreover, they provide existing customers with benefits along the way which is really good, like unlimited data on National Day! WOWWW!!"
5,"Circles life is the best! Disrupting the current local networks and forcing them to give the people what they deserve, aka more data! And also providing one of the greatest and most stable networks for its users too! "
5,"My experience with Circle Life has been positive ever since i port over from Starhub. From the porting in experience to using it for close to 9 months now, everything is fuss free. I am notified when the bill is in and the customer service has been good, if not great. Highly recommended for people who feels that the top 3 carriers are charging too high."
4,"Although I am not a Circles.Life subscriber, but I find the app can also be quite useful to keep track of the ongoing promos/events going around in Singapore."
1,"Lousy teleco, only focuses on profit, flashes promotion to lure in customers and neglect existing loyal customers. Avoid at all cost. Bad service staff, gives attitude when contacted"
1,"Circle.Life plan 20 GB for $28  comes with 100 mins talktime + 25 SMSes + free caller ID  You only get $120 cashback when you transfer your number to Circles.Life., means getting $10 off your bill for 12 months but it not applicable on your first bill. So if your first bill included 1.5 months plan, which mean your 1.5 month are not applicable on the $10 off plan on your bill.   You will get charge on Global SMS received on your phone also. The charges are auto deduct your credit card without you validating your bill first.   Please take note as there's a lot of hidden cost and statement. And their service are bad. "
1,"I am still receiving the monthly bill from SingTel. I was told that cancelling is not required when I sign up for circle but was not make known that porting the secondary line will not cancel the contract with SingTel. So now I‚Äôm incurred double bills from both. When I contacted circle CS via messenger, the staff mentioned that I need to check with SingTel myself despite promising hassle free transaction. Overall, did not receive satisfactory service with inadequate responses to my enquiries."
5,"Easy to port over from other carriers, simple and convenient to sign up. Just have to wait for your SIM card package to arrive and just have to plug and play. Good coverage over the entire country. Been using for the past 2 years, no problems at all"
5,Switched from Singtel.  I have a strong emphasis on seeking good customer service and willing to pay a slight premium in comparison to getting the cheapest Telco with crappy follow up service.  Circles Life is great.  Pros: 1. Excellent Customer Service 2. Easy access without fuss via Facebook or app 3. Base plan and easy to stack on any additional plans. 4. Value their customers with great promos or additional data.  Cons: 1. Nil to date
4,I am using circle life now and it‚Äôs the cheapest with the most data. The connection is good even in underground. No contract is what I like best. 
5,Awesomeness... my life is better with circles life... no need bother about not enough data at month end .... Cool effective  and hassle free customer service  Clear easy to assess app ... I get extra data playing games and link my ez link  card  . 
5,"Switch over from singtel some 2 months ago. One of my best decision ever. The porting is hassle free and painless. And the cost is a fraction of singtel. A fraction!!! 6GB at $28 is awesome! Base plan allows customisation, macam buy McDonald‚Äôs like that, just add what you want. Everything just works smoothly with the app. 4G wise, i dont see any major connectivity issues. Will recommend."
4,"Switched over to Circles.Life recently in March 2019.   Took a good deal from Circles.Life worth $600.  1.CIS benefits (3 months‚Äô subscription worth $84) 2. $120 cashback in bill credits (port-in from Starhub) 3. $200 bill credits with phone purchase via Circles (Samsung Galaxy S10e at $200 upfront discount as well)  Not the best in transparency though, as the promotional discounts are only verified to be applied, after an in-app chat with Circles.Life black belt customer happiness expert (Customer Care).  Other than that, pretty good for the Circles.Life experience so far for the past 4 months. "
4,Abundance of data to use at affordable rates! What's not to love abt it? Have recommended to many of my friends and they agree to! Data for life!! 
3,Service on their messenger was really fast and efficient. However net speeds can be staggered after the max data which is an inconvenience
3,"I have been in circles for about 2 over years, and what I love about it is definitely the data. But I do think that their reception can stand to improve for sure. It feels like the other telcos are catching up with their offerings and with Better reception "
4,"I love how users can earn rewards by tagging their EZ-Link card but recently, there was a revision to the points required to claim a reward, which was a little upsetting... the points we earned in turn depreciates in value and double the effort is required to get the same reward.."
5,Circles.life is a good company with good data coverage throughout the island and the data amount that they offer is so good that you will never run out of data.
4,Second best mobile data provider (beside TPG). Unlimited mobile data monthly for a year at $18 per month. For budget conscious people. 
4,"I am currently using this as the rates are the lowest I can find on the market, and I am attracted to the promotions it give regularly. It is a hassle free process porting my number from Singtel."
5,The customer service team is always very helpful. I am always very happy as I know my issues will be resolve promptly.
5,Love the $0 per month Flexi plan. No other telcos are offering this tier. Best virtual telco among the competiton. 
5,"Was the best in the market at $20 for 20GB. The coverage is okay, better than TPG which loses its connections at a lot of areas especially underground. The data speed decreases a lot once we hit 20GB though."
5,I can‚Äôt help but rave about Circles.Life data plan. The perks of you match it to a normal telco company can‚Äôt be compared. Fuss free and worry free. You Everything is within your control and budget via the app. 
5,"Because of circle life, other telco starts to bring down their price..   Paying $30 a month with 20GB. Is more than what I need. "
5,"To be honest, the best thing isn't that their data plans are damn worth it, its their customer service. No more listening to a robot and waiting for someone on the other side to pick up, its now a chat room. The longest I've waited for someone to answer my query was 5 mins, usually its almost instant! Very helpful because you're not texting a robot but an actual person."
4,Almost 2 years with circles.life and I have thoroughly enjoyed their service. Their customer service will respond to you as quickly as they could. Connections are pretty good apart from underground in mrt stations. 
5,Stable and good! Alot of data to use and you can just add on through the app easily! Time to subscribe to circles! 
5,"They were the ones that changed the game for Telco plans and data charges. Was afraid to give up my plan at first because I was afraid that cheap prices means compromised connection, I probed around to make sure that connectivity was fine before jumping ship since I was a data reliant and constantly went over the limit.  No RAGRATS! For the price point and data, I am super happy with Circles.Life. Their app is pretty cool as well, anybody still thinking about switching? Just go!"
5,"Circles life provided great 24/7 online customer service. Their mobile connection is also really great, as I do not experience any drops when using it. Not to mention, they are super cheap and give a lot of data for the amount of $$$ you pay!"
4,Thank you circle life for you $0/ month data sim card! It is definitely worth it paying to the delivery and admin. Barge where I get to have a spare sim card of extra data usage! 
5,Just ported-in to this from Zero1 mainly for mobile data. Port-in process was done in 3 working days smoothly. Mobile data coverage is good so far. 
5,Did not encounter any service disruption so far since I joined at the start of the year. Customer service was also top notched - I raised an enquiry when my cash back was not given and they replied promptly to inform that they will rectify it in the next month bill (and threw in free 1 GB of data that month too :D )
5,"Porting over was so easy. First time I got same day sim delivery. Never thought it was possible to get so much data, they are truly game changers. My parents whom were already on circles life got upgraded from 6gb to 20gb. They won't leave existing customers behind! Got a reply via their help chat in minutes. Good customer support."
5,Perks :  - No Contract - Best priced SIM ONLY plan in Singapore - Fast and free delivery time and porting time - Identical connection speed and coverage as M1 - Free 2GB after port-in and 500MB/6mths and 200MB per friend referral - CirclesApp where you can customize and service everything regarding your plan  Cons: - Billing is made in advance for the following month  Cheers & Happy Porting ! 
3,"Switched over from Singtel recently.  Pros: 1. Porting over was quite easy and fast 2. It's much cheaper than my previous bill of $80 a month geez  Cons:  1. There was the $18 a month if you port over promo going around everywhere, that's why I chose Circles.Life, but apparently YOU GOTTA KEY IN A PROMO CODE in the app before getting it, so I had to pay $28 for the first 2 months before I realised. They said they sent an email but I received nothing of the sort.  2. The app UX is not great.. I can't track my data easily, the visualisation of data is SO confusing, and I didn't even know how call time is calculated until I exceeded and they said incoming calls cost money too. Please just use a bar like Singtel instead of a circle. Also their bonus tab is super confusing also... too much going on. "
2,"Want to complain the services of circle life company; I signed up on May and there no contract and saying no ant charges and totally free for first 3 months, and I can end the services any time during first 3 month; SGD 28 per month from the 4th month; but circle life charged me 60+ dollars on Jun 2019; I complained in their live chat(they even don‚Äôt have hotline), your staff saying only can refund 20 dollars to me next month and the rest on another month later!! How come like that? i request your staff to call me back but did not receive any call back from them until now‚Ä¶.."
5,"Been with circles life for almost 2 years now, it‚Äôs been great! Love how prompt & friendly their customer service folks are üëçüèª"
4,"Great choice using Circles.life. No contract and only pays about $18 every month. The cheapest provider in singapore. If you are not satisfied, you can terminate it immediately too."
1,Port-in is pro-rated where as porting out is allowed only end of the month. What a LOUSY hidden terms Circles.Life have. AWFUL Experience.
1,"It was relatively easy to sign up, but when I needed help, horrible.   I had a defective SIM card that took 5 interactions to resolve to reach a conclusions - and insult me as a client by giving a '$25 waiver' which they charge for a replacement card - for their bad service and defective products.  Their people are poorly trained and not empowered to resolve problems. They hide behind process.    If I walked into Singtel which I did recently, 5 minutes.    It is clear they are immature, unprofessionally and poorly managed organization that is not for anyone who values their time.    Don't waste your time.  Rick"
5,"I was always feeling angry to be paying top dollar to my then telco but monitoring my data consumption like a scrouge. Coupled with the fact that I was with the same telco since I started working a long time ago and always felt left out in ongoing promos. Then I switched to Circles and never looked back. Granted I had a bump when my SIM card didn't arrive at first but all fears that I had no customer service because there was no physical shop were unfounded as they gave the most prompt and efficient service that i had in a long time. Since then, I have converted my entire family to Circles. Just waiting for their solution re overseas plan to make it perfect!"
4,Porting was easy and fuss free.  Many different types of perks given to loyal customers. But customer service experience wasn't ideal over the phone.
5,"Ported over from Singtel.  I know now a lot of users have ported out cause there are better deals. But the thing that I feel is good about circles is that they always never forget about existing consumers.  They upgraded my plan recently for free,can never be thankful enough. I am already pretty satisfied with their existing plan prior upgrading don't get me wrong.  Although I still receive ton of the new marketing emails which I felt was more for potential users than existing cause I ported in already. Lol Tbh their network used to be quite unstable, always heard that m1 network isn't as good. But now i managed to see some improvement in their network within Singapore. But, Ulu places like tekong might need a little improvement. (feedback from friend in army)  Customer service wise they are quite prompt on Facebook answered my enquiries pretty fast. Overall quite a good operator. Still very amazed how they could never ever deplete in their promo deals like damn that creativity tho! I'm also using it along side with the the ezlink app btw!  Good job Circles!"
2,"Porting over was easy and fuss-free. Really great perks when they just started. But now, as they are gaining market share, the customer service has been getting worse. I was enquiring on whatsapp passport when I received the mailer on it being stopped. Customer service advised that it can be activated thru them but few months later when I want to activate, they now say it has been stopped completely. And the attitude from them wasn't helping at all. Now I am thinking to change the telco that provides overseas data packages not on roaming."
5,"There‚Äôs no perfect telco but this is as good as it gets! Pros: super super easy interface to track data usage, make add ons, view your bills, chat with support  Cons: certain areas do not have much signal but those have been problematic for most telcos  The other telcos can come up with a bunch of new goodies, free data etc but those does NOT buy customer loyalty.  There‚Äôs only so much freebies you can throw at a customer, then there‚Äôs CL which has been giving top notch, CONSISTENT customer support and transparency for 2 years. I aint going anywhere y‚Äôall :)"
5,"The overall process from Sign up, to delivery of SIM card, to porting in of number, to customer support is a breeze! And i can even customize my plan as and when i need?! SAY WHUTTTTT! The competitive pricing and not being tied down to a long a** contract makes me love it so much! WHAT A DEAL, WHAT A STEAL!  I still remember the early days when phones have internet and the standard was 12GB. A few years down the roads, those 3 major Telcos in SG all dropped it down to 3-4GB. Now they can offer you back 20GB??? Think about how much money they will s*ck from you over the years if not for Circles.Life coming into the play.   CIRCLES.LIFE BANZAI!!!"
1,No customer service representative to solve issue...using machine as customer service is terrible service provider...old ppl cannot read instructions can't hold lines with this service provider. . .
5,"Been with Circles for almost a year now, and it just keeps getting better. The company's relatively new to the game so give it time to establish itself as worthy among the telco pioneers, but for now definitely sticking with it."
1,"Bad bad bad experience on this network. I ran out of data, i boosted for 2gb for $10 and it didnt came in. I decided to repeat the boosting process again and suddenly boosted 4gb. Not a big deal, so i have 4.4gb left data. I checked my data around 3pm afternoon because im actually using wifi and im turning on my data cos im going outside. Then im surprised that my remaining data was on 700MB left. But im not using it and my wifi setting is automatic connection if there is available wifi. So i did live chat and explained my problem. All of them hanged up the conversation and dont want to help me. Im so disappointed and so so upset.   Bad bad bad experience üò™üò™üò™"
1,"Both Email and Live chat support are terrible! Went through both Live Chat and Email , after 24hrs still cant respond to my query! Look for other Provider!"
4,"Good deals with more data over the months. Responsive customer service. Somehow after I left for another telco, I could no longer signed up for their new plans. Seems like a ban or blacklist."
1,"After activation of the sim I realised I made a huge mistake. I had to chase them to honor what I had signed up for , also i spent more time with then on chat then I would do a normal Telco. After a day I wanted to cancel they said I can't as I should have read terms and conditions that locked in to 2 billing cycles hence a 2 month contract when they advertise it to be no contract. The service is lousy, the app often crashes and it's just constantly advertising to to upsell.  Awful and big regret . Don't get sucked into their false advertising."
5,"APPLICATION PROCESS I‚Äôd applied for the line on Monday late afternoon and I get my SIM card delivered the next working day at my workplace. The application process was really enjoyable and simple. It‚Äôs a breeze as I just need my phone and my bank card ready. The online chat assistant were very active and friendly for my enquries too. CONNECTION IN MRT I travelled the Purple NEL and Yellow Circleline daily, no experience of connection drop when I surf, Facebook, Instagram and watch snaps of video on those platforms while on train. Calls received were clear and no breaks too. Signals on land are pretty strong too. PRICE I'd ported in from other telco, I get an additional 2GB/month free. Total of 6GB in total only $28/month and this is without any tied down of any contract. Many other telco are starting or started to offer SIM-ONLY plans, but my personal reason to remain with Circle is because they offer 500MB/month for every 6 months you stay with them. It is a definite benefits with practicality for being a loyal customer! After two years, you get 2GB more on TOP of your 6GB at the price of $28! "
4,"Circles Life has good customer service and rewards their customers for their loyalty. When I contacted them about being charged for an MMS that I did not send, the Customer Care agent agreed to waive the charge right there and then - no question asked or waiting a few days to know the outcome. They also reward their customers with 500 MB bonus data for every 6 months that you stay with them. In addition, they have been giving bonus data through daily polls and on special occasions.  The downside is that their basic plan does not include SMSes, so you get charged for every SMS sent. Also, the 100 mins talktime is for both incoming and outgoing calls."
5,Good service and customer service response. Good value of money  and so far the service still never fails me.  over all great plan and service.
4,"the service is pretty good. easy ways to self help and self service so I don't have to spend time to go through their calling system.   i can easily increase my data whenever i need it.  Overall, the flexibility and fuss free modifications to my plan is a real plus for me."
4,Signed up for the $0 flexi plan! Great for myself who works from home hence little need for mobile data! 1GB suffices and all is great! 
5,"I love the idea of not being bound to a contract yet having so much transparency and flexibility of adjusting my plan via their mobile application. Signed up for their base plan and had to pay only $18 after using a promo code. The activation process was smooth and I managed to get it up and running quickly.   Recently, I signed up for their $0/mo flexi plan which is awesome since it's free and there are no strings attached.   Overall, the service is pretty reliable and I look forward to more surprises (bonus data) from Circles.Life. Using Starhub as my main phone line concurrently and am planning to port over after my contract ends to avoid paying termination fees."
5,"I must said that me and my wife have been using this circles.life plan for 4months with no hussle at all... Everything is transparent and plus no contracts at all, at any moment we can cancel if we want to without paying any termination fees. Service customer wise, they are indeed very prompt in replying and also in a freindly manner should be on live or make calls but normally thru emails as they will explain to you in a Layman terms for us to understand.  The service line as well, its very clear and not to say crystal clear but it's just perfect and me and my wife took the 26GB, even till end of the month, we do still have balance GB as shown on the circles.life apps. So far we never try the whatsapp passport or roaming yet but definately going to use it one day as they will show us per day, per each countries we need to pay.   Well, we will never look back and we will be still using circles.life till we really get bored. Saves money compared to some telco's line out there."
5,I recently signed up for the $0 flexi plan. (1GB a month) It's completely free and I'm very happy with it. I didn't even have to provide my credit card details.  Registration was super easy and delivery was very quick. I activated the sim card immediately and started using it the day I received it.  The CirclesCare app is user friendly. So far I've only used the data and I'm satisfied with the network speed.  I really hope that their website is correct that there is no catch with this free plan because it just seems too good to be true! I just wish this plan came up earlier before I ported my number to another telco
5,"It‚Äôs really perfect for me! No more being tied down by contracts, flexible - I can add on more data or even pause the plan if I‚Äôm overseas for long periods, I can monitor my phone bill and usage easily on the circles life app. It‚Äôs user-friendly and their customer service is prompt & friendly. I recommend this mobile service to everyone! Try it, change your life, be free! "
5,Port to Circles.Life from Starhub since Oct 2017.  Surprising to me ->  No complain from me.  Circles.Life provides an accurate billing system.  Easy to manage the customize and data usage.  Good loyalty reward and customer services.  Keep it up.
3,"Slight improvement for mrt commuter but north east line is still foggy little signal that drop line or connect.  However, cs is good. "
4,"Swapped from singtel to circleslife 5months now. Going to receive my 1st data bonus of 500mb end of May!  Initial contact with before I decided to change to circleslife is their customer service. I signed up for their free trial past year and realize the signal at my residential address is very weak. Although they advertised as 4g island wide coverage, but the signal was only 2-3 bar most of the time. Emailed them to enquire, they replied within 2hrs! Unexpected fast reply which ""wow"" me. They helped with the issue and engaged their network team to investigate. It took about 2weeks to get back to me, but they managed to resolve the weak signal issue. Now, I'm their happy customer! Although I still encounter fluctuating signal at my residential, but it is still acceptable. Highly recommended! Moreover if you need data, they are giving free 500mb/ 6 months perpetually till you decided to end your contract with them."
4,"My admittedly short time with circles.life was pretty swell. I like how they pushed for better value in the market and seem to be still trying out new things (3 dollars a day for unlimited boost) Only real complaint was the network at times behaved erratically due to them being on M1 network, but overall was a decent experience.  Switched away only because another service provider fits my need better."
5,"I switched over in early Feb before my then mobile plan ended, because I was consistently bursting my data limit under that other telco. I decided the move would be worth it even though I would be incurring penalty fees for early termination (1-2 months). I was initially afraid that for the insane amount of data I was afforded at a much lower cost than any other telco, I would in exchange receive way compromised coverage and connectivity. Extremely happy to report that this has not been my experience thus far. To be honest, my experience thus far is that the connectivity does not lose to my previous telco‚Äôs (disclaimer: new user and I don‚Äôt frequent ulu places often) Payment modes are convenient. The app‚Äôs user experience is intuitive and smooth. Most importantly I can surf the Internet with a peace of mind. Thank you Circles Life for bringing us more options with your customisable plans :)"
5,At first I thought my network connections may suffer after switching to Circles but I was wrong. The whole experience porting to Circles was seamless and smooth. The additional data at the same cost is a godsend. 
5,"A really good telco that supports the porting over, has good connection and very flexible plan. However, the area covered could be better covered especially in more ulu areas in Singapore (example: deeper sites of Lim Chu Kang) but overall no issues in neighbourhood/town areas! "
4,No real issues with Circles Life. But you can't do a transfer of ownership once you are an existing customer.
4,"The order and SIM card delivery were efficiency as well as easy to deal with. I am using it for the second month. The network speed is fast, consistently above 35mbps. I don't have home broadband and I tried the $3 unlimited day pass. It was fantastic, seamlessly boast the quota for the day. The $20 for 20GB is a good deal. I just hope that the unused data can flow over to the following month."
5,Customizable and good incentives that makes it a value proposition! I was paying 1.75 times my current Circles rate for a 3G connection with the biggest competitor! What got my goat was the 5$ charge for caller ID. That is when I decided enough is enough and moved to Circles.life. Have absolutely no regrets since then and openly suggest others to choose Circles over other incumbents.
4,"I switched over from M1 after being their customer my whole life - and I never once regretted it!  I love how reliable Circles.Life is, I have rarely experienced any data outage (except once!). The best part is that I can still surf the web while underground in the MRT! For $30 a month, circles.life is quite reasonable for 7GB of data.  My only complaint is that incoming SMSes are chargeable? I get alot of delivery uncles sending me SMSes for the status of my delivery items. It's not something in my control so it's a bit disappointing I am getting charged.  Otherwise, their customer service is excellent (are your CS staff robots??), always answering my questions quickly."
5,they have changed the mobile market ever since they have come on board.  Excellent customer service and extremely responsive.  It is good that they are listening and making inroads to win users over.  I am 20 months into circles and have no complaints at all.  Excellent overall connectivity from wherever I am.  
5,"Happy to be circles.life customer.  * Switched from SingTel to circles a few months back. The process was very simple and I PAY LESS for MORE DATA :)  * User-friendly website and app, unlike SingTel. Easy to obtain any information immediately.  * Efficient CS team, they respond to any queries quickly.   * Cheaper plans and frequent bonuses.   "
5,"I was a little sceptical when Circles.Life first came out. More data with cheaper monthly bill? Sounds too good to be true to me. So I waited another year to observe this virtual telco before making the switch from SingTel. Even then, I was nervous about hidden costs, slow data, or poor customer services.   How wrong was I! Circles has been very transparent with their costing and billing. Registration of $38 ($20 discount if signed up in roadshows which I highly recommend over using your friends‚Äô promo code as you get free data from roadshow too), $28 base monthly bill, and any other add ons you choose to add.   Data speed is decent, though it can get slightly slower in underground train travels and further away from main city (eg Pulau Tekong where I serve my NS). With the amount of bonus data I have, there‚Äôs very few times I worry about exceeding my monthly usage. Of course, that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt watch videos on my phone.   Circles created a Facebook group for users to voice out their technical issues and suggestions for the relatively new telco it is. I am impressed at this very gesture as it shows that they do care about their users and strive to provide the best. I recall scrolling through the group and saw suggestions such as whatsapp passport and unlimited data. A few weeks later, whatsapp passport is available at $1 a day and unlimited data on demand is available at $3 a day. Not only are these add ons cheap, the Circles team also listened and implemented our suggestions promptly.   There‚Äôs no doubt that I am thoroughly satisfied with Circles.Life for their wonderful telco service. Kudos to Circles!"
5,Pro: - Manage your plan through an mobile app instead of calling through their customer support. -  Good UI for mobile app - Connection wise is quite good for most area (except certain area in MRT Tunnel)  Con: - No customer support hotline to call
5,"Switched from Singtel to Circles.Life.  Porting In from Singtel-  This process is really simple as you will have to only fill in a form and it can be done online!! And a simple switching of sim card and a few messages would allow them to help you finish the job in a matter of a few days. (Really easy for a 19yearold who didnt really understand anything)  Life with Circles.Life Being able to track and pay my bills easily through an app allows me to pay my own bills on time and wont have to rely on my parents which can worry them time to time.  Being an NSF, it doesnt take up alot of my allowance which is a plus point. BOOST ( buying addtional data ) doesnt cost as much as my previous telco and it saves lives when you accidentally exceed your data plan.  Only downside is that the connections can sometimes be really bad when you go to secluded areas which can cause inconvenience.  However, I must emphasize that you will not really get signals or connections when youre in the deeper parts of an army camp.  Would recommend Circles.Life to NSFs who needs lots of data but does not have alot of money but works in camps that are very accessible."
3,"Have been with Circles.Life since my M1 Plan ended around Feb 17. So far I‚Äôve been pretty happy with my bills. However, there are a few things that can definitely be improved regarding the performance of the network and the app.  Pros:  - Very good price as compared to others in the SIM only aspect. - Frequent bonuses on data that can be applied flexibly over a period of time. - Fairly easy to use app and accuracy of tracking data usage.  Cons:  - Connectivity has issues sometimes. (The 4G / 3G icon can randomly disappear and I lose connection for quite a few minutes.) - notifications on the app can be really annoying."
5,Own Circles Life for more than a year. So far i happy with it.  Pro:  - More data will be awarded as long you stay with them and subscription is always $28. - One apps settle all. - Coverage well covered.  Con: - Nothing so far.
5,"I've been with Circles.Life for just over 2 months and the porting experience was smooth. No long waiting times over the phone/customer service counter. They also replied my many queries really quickly! As a student, even the benefits at the other telcos could not beat the price or data that I could get on Circles.Life. Currently, I'm paying $28 for 7GB/month. (no add-ons)  Awesome: Lifesaver when my broadband decided to hate me on a few nights.  Caller ID is free!  In-app live chat is also great, I once wanted to find out what were the charges if I were to exceed the current data I had and had my query answered really promptly over the live chat. To anyone else who is wondering, once you have finished using your data, you won't ""explode"" your bill, but you simply would not be able to use 3G till the end of the month. This function is in place so that you won't incur excessive charges as a customer (much thoughtful, such wow, who would've thought) and if you'd like, simply top up 200MB, 1GB, or 2GB or unlimited data for $3 per day!   Not so awesome: The calls are pretty limited, at 100 minutes per month for the basic plan, it includes both incoming and outgoing, which adds up real quick. You could go for the add-ons, or simply put the free Whatsapp calls to use.  Not a huge concern but currently, there are no perks of being a Circles.Life user, as compared to Singtel or M1's rewards such as 1 for 1 movies or entertainment/meal options. But, you do get more data for every 6 months you stay on.   Would still give it a 5 star rating as the entire process of porting over, daily use, to billing is really smooth and fuss-free.  "
5,"My Starhub phone contact ended in July 2017. I thought that was a good opportunity for me to either 1) get a new contract and sell the phone 2) explore circles.life contract free plans, and buy a contract free phone when i'm ready.   I did a full telco comparison for iphone 7 plus (back then 8 wasn't released yet), i compared and see which telco offers me the best discount for my phone - with a data plan which provides at least 6gb/mth. The result was shocking; it no longer make sense to pay for phone with a 2 year contract under any telco because i'll end up paying more (24 mths x plan month fee + cost of phone). It was clear that getting circles.life was the most flexible (contract free) and ""value for money"" decision.  Initially, i was afraid that i may encounter challenges with number port over and connectivity issues, and i'm glad that those fear were unnecessary. Number port over was smoonth, everything settled on the projected date. I installed my sim card and my phone is good to go. Connection has been great since day 1; coming from my long experience with Starhub, i did not feel any differences. In fact, starhub connection was bad in my office, circles.life connection was better. When i went back reservist, i paid extra $20 for 20GB data in that month so i can watch netflix in camp =D  Last but not least, the customer experience with circles.life has been amazing. I started with 6gb data, then i received an additional 0.5GB data on my bday, and another 2 GB data from a promotion.   Since i signed up, i have recommended Circles.life telco to 2 of my friends. "
5,"I've recently hit my first 6 month mark with circles life, which means I've just had my first 500mb bonus added to my account. I've never been happier with my Telco.   Plus points: - Unlimited whatsapp, which means unlimited whatsapp calls. Ive recently removed the free incoming option calls because with the ability to make free WhatsApp calls, I find myself using less than 20 minutes talk time a month.  - Excellent value (especially with the 500mb loyalty bonus that got added recently). I've not had a phone bill more than $30.25 even when I had the free incoming add on. - Customer service: the in app chat feature is brilliant. Instant answers to queries without being put on hold.  Cons: - roaming costs are expensive. But the recently introduced unlimited WhatsApp add on (for use while roaming) would go a long way if it works as described. Have yet to try it out.  All in all, it's been a great ride with circles life. I signed up for a separate Zero1 line earlier this month because I got tempted by their ""$19 per month"" proposition, but I've only been deeply disappointed by them so far. In spite of my being billed, I have after three weeks still no news of a projected delivery date, and their customer service (which is only reachable by email) is abysmal. Slow and non helpful replies! I plan on cancelling the zero1 line at the first available opportunity"
4,"Hi All,  Had been a loyal M1 customer since my poly days till fatherhood (35yo) & I remb the days when M1 rewarded their loyal customers with birthday vouchers yearly, till recent few years they have stopped giving and I had to call & 'beg' for them if I wanted to recontract or sign up new phones. Changed to Circle Life mainly for the savings of monthly bills & since they are using M1 network, I have the same network reception. What I like about Circle is their flexibility for the charges & of course the loyalty rewards (500mb extra every 6mths). Can see this telco having some impacts to the 3 main telcos & just want to say: If you treat your loyal customers well, you can be sure we will stay with you Circle Life!"
5,"Before: I was a Singtel customer since my dad got me the line when I was 15 so that's about 20 years. The push factor was that I never, EVER felt like I was being treated like a loyal customer. In fact, I've had too many instances where they were just plain low balling me (e.g. Birthday treats can't be redeemed, mysterious charges on the bill). But it wasn't easy leaving a long-term relationship no matter how detrimental it might be. Plus, I was a singtel circle member so I got free data on Sundays.  The pitch: Then Circles.Life dropped in and offered my company a Corp package. Pretty attractive package with quite a lot of data: 27gb a month.  Coming from a 3GB plan where I had to religiously watch every drop of data consumed,  this was a windfall. But that's not the determining factor.  So I dropped hints on Facebook I was planning to switch and wanted advice from my friends and I also tagged singtel and Circles.Life.  Guess which telco replied? They didn't even have to convince or pitch to me. They just said hi and told me I can contact them for further details.  So all the other considerations about connectivity, reliability, cost comparisons, value, etc. faded into the background because really, for a telco or any organisation to reach out to their customers so readily and easily, that's nothing to be sniffed at. I would know because my 2 jobs have been at organisations that are customer focused. And it makes a world of difference to know the organisation I'm paying for the service, gives enough of a damn to want to talk to me. Or at the very least, gives enough of a damn to spend money to hire people to talk to their customers. Too many other organisations pay lip service to putting their customers first and how they're ""making everyday better"". Who's day exactly?   That open line of communication is priceless in today's hyper saturated market.  Consideration: Of course, as a consumer, I'm price sensitive so I will never say never to changing and Circles.Life has set a pretty high bar for service standards which I hope they can live up to as they scale up. But from what I've seen so far, nobody else comes close as a total package.   Pros: -Top class customer engagement -clear and easy to manage plans  the proof of the pudding is in the eating. When others sort to obfuscate by piling all sorts of nonsensical and unnecessary additions into your mobile plan (SMS-es?! Really?! Even illegal money lenders have moved onto WhatsApp.), the simplicity of being able to customise your plan, giving you control over what you really want, is gold dust to consumers.  - good enough connectivity I can't say for sure that connectivity is awesome because I'm well aware that Circles.Life is riding on M1's infrastructure which doesn't exactly make one feel like you're walking on sunshine TBH. But as a trade off for the other perks n liberties you get, it is well worth it.  Cons: - connectivity (see above) - no exclusive deals for phones - smaller group of merchant partners This point isn't much of a problem for me because I'm stuffed to the gills with all sorts of cards and memberships that I don't even use. So really, if merchant deals are a tiebreaker for you in choosing a telco, I'd advise you to reconsider your (Circles) life choices.  Have a good one y'all! Hit me up if you need more advice in your consideration process. "
4,"Absolutely an advocate of Circles Life.  Circles Life has got to be the most value-added telco service. These are the few reasons why:  1) They are generous with their data! I live for data, and they understand customers like us (hahaha) 2) Great customer service. They could answer my questions so quickly, and settle my concerns. I like that they are so easy to reach. 3) Speedy rectification of problems. When I first signed up, I was told I would be getting 3 months of data, whereas the fine print was ""even if the contract starts on the last day of the month, it is counted as a month"". They responded to my request and extended that additional month of free 20GB.  4) Great IT infrastructure. Bills are sent electronically, can be seen on the app as well as in the emails. Everything is simple to use! 5) My mother had trouble typing English, and wow they could even respond in Chinese to her. I think it's really cool. 6) Cost is low, and very worthy. Converted my mother, and now going to convert the rest of my family too (Good things must share!)  Cons: - sometimes when we want to reach their customer service rep through the app, they dont respond immediately and I dont like to wait with the app on. So by the time I came back to the app after scrolling somewhere else, the conversation was closed by the rep. Can be better managed! - Could come up with Chinese setting for the app instead. My mother had trouble understanding some of the English. - Really poor connection in some areas (especially entire purple line).  Overall two thumbs up!"
5,"I have been using Circles for more than a year now and overall pretty happy with the service.  Pros : 1. Just simply love the amount of customisation options available through their Circles Care App -  No more waiting to get through to customer service over a call üòÄ. There is even an option to chat with customer service through the app in case a need arises.  2. The customisations(on adhoc basis)  includes but not limited to : Data boost, Call duration allowance, Option to enable unlimited incoming/outgoing calls and lots more! Again all of this can be done through the Circles Care App. 3. Fuss free pricing that factors in GST and Caller Number Display i.e. No additional charges for these. 4. 500MB Free data allowance bump up to the plan for loyalty -  once every 6 months. 5. Complete peace of mind with no contract.  Cons : 1. Circles share their infrastructure with M1 network and hence coverage is limited to what is available with M1. There are weak spots especially on the North East line.  That's all I can think of folks!  "
4,"It has been exactly a year since I‚Äôve ported over to Circles life from Singtel, and I‚Äôm happy to say that it‚Äôs been awesome! Not only do I get 6Gb of data monthly, after 6 months of usage, I‚Äôm awarded with another 500Mb of monhly data as a loyal customer. On top of that, I get an additional 500mb when it‚Äôs my birthday! How cool is that! But there‚Äôs one factor which I love about Circles the most, and it‚Äôs the connectivity. When I was using SingTel, I often face issues with connectivity when I travel on the MRT. SingTel always resets its connection on certain stations along the track. This gives me problem especially when I‚Äôm watching a movie or playing some games. With Circles, this hasn‚Äôt been a problem ever since. Hence Circles truly rules with its connectivity! "
4,"Switching from SingTel to Circles Life, my life in the north south line trains got much better because I no longer suffer SingTel‚Äôs coverage dead zone.  Circles Life is very easy to use because everything is controlled via an app and you have full control.  While their customer service and SIM card delivery processes can be better improved, no other complains so far."
5,"I had done my tour of duty with the three telcos & thought I would stay with green until Circles came along. Great, fast and effective customer service along with value for money plans that gave me what I needed (and not rubbish I don need like 300 mins talk time) ensures that Circles is the one for me. "
5,"My Story: Been using Circles.life since August 2016 when they were holding their NDP promotion. Circles.life has been a life changer for me after breaking my 1 year contract with my previous telco, because even paying the cancellation fee was worth it.  For once, I went from having 3 gb to 6 gb immediately with Circles.Life, while dropping $20 from my monthly bill. Following that, I have been getting free data from various promotions and referrals. There's even a point where I had about 50+ GB for free that month, while paying only $28. Currently running at 16.1 GB and paying the base price of $28 still.  Comparison: Below is a comparison of why you should and should not move to Circles.life. I'm not even going to list prices as a main factor because it's quite irrelevant to my review.  PROS: 1. Short customer service waiting time - If you have a problem with anything, the live chat can get you sorted out. Plus, it takes less than 5 minutes (usually instant) to reach support. Out of 10 problems, 9 times were resolved instantly for me. The other one time took 2 hours as they had to settle something back end. 2. Facing problems - Data outage and can't access your internet? Circles.Life compensates its users every time there is a hiccup, giving free data once. 3. Great experiences - For one, they held an event at a nightclub for users. I was invited to it and the event was pretty amazing, and even giving out free swag and data to attendees. 4. Loyalty pays off - A lot of reviews tend to not mention this but you'll get 500 MB every 6 months up to 2 GB. 5. Be at the front of the pack - Circles.life kicked off a lot of changes, remember seeing data prices drastically drop once Circles.life launched the 20 for $20? They recently launched a $3 unlimited plan per day at time of writing this review. 6. Community - There's a 'inner circle' that you can join if you're a member, and there's monthly meetings that is held at the moment for its members. Activities ranging from meals, board games, and even hanging out at Circles.Life office and know the team!  CONS: 1. Data roaming - Circles.Life hasn't really tackled data roaming and stuff like M1 Data passport is still better if you're a frequent traveller. There's some small steps towards this such as the $1/day whatsapp for overseas 2. Dual sim - There's no such feature where you can have 2 members sharing the same pool of data, talk time, and sms. if you're on such a plan, Circles.Life is definitely not for you. 3. No Physical Shops - Being a digital telco, they don't have any physical shops at all if you want to talk to a live person. However, they hold roadshows from time to time at various parts of Singapore. 4. Data 'dead' spots - There's reports of certain parts of Singapore where data doesn't exist, for example parts of North East Line faces this problem.  It's hard not to be biased, but I tried my best to make this review as unbiased as possible. It's also a compilation of my entire Circles.life experience since when I joined, and they definitely deliver an experience that is unbeatable by the main 3 telcos."
4,"Switched over from Singtel. Circles works just like any other telco, occasional problems like poor signal at some places (singtel,M1, starhub also have issues like this in some places anyway.).  Pros Overall, really cheap and worth it, very good and easy customization of your plan on the circles app (unlike most other telcos).  Cons Not so worth it if u are getting a free phone along with the plan? "
5,I love it! Been using since Oct 2017. Huge sucker for its out of box campaigns (but I digressed).  No connection issues for me (thought to highlight that since there's some hearsay going on).  I've slashed my bills (ex M1 user here) from 70+ to 30+ per month. That's more than 50% of savings. Happy user here!  #endofdatadeprivation 
5,"Starting Capital  - Requires $3000 min because each client has their personal Saxo account. You get view-only access to this account as well. Therefore, AutoWealth cannnot buy fractional shares for you. Good and bad, depending on how you see it. Because each unit of ETF is not cheap, one way is to perform quarterly top-ups of $300 instead of $100 monthly. I like the physical segregation.  Physical Presence - An adviser is assigned to each client (contactable via direct WhatsApp in my case) and there is a short 30-mins meet-up process to settle the paperwork. An good opportunity to settle your doubts and ask the tough questions. Again, some like this while others don't.  Platform UI - Not the most fanciful nor as clean as its competitors. For me, I don't need the bling-blings as long as it gets the job done. Very detailed information which I like.  Returns - Ignore the comparisons on returns especially on such short terms. Robo-advisors have lots of assets in the US market by virtue of weightage and most, if not all, are doing well for the past few months. Don't bother investing if you're not going to hold for at least 5-10 years.  Dividend Re-Investment - You can choose to receive dividends or re-invest them automatically. Re-investing them saves you the trouble.  Investment Methodology - I see this as the true passive indexing portfolio because it gets pure market returns. Not gonna try and beat the market but instead going for market returns.  Responsiveness - Top ups are processed promptly and access to my adviser is quick and easy. Overall, a 5-star experience for me over the last quarter of 2017.  Kevin L. Turtle Investor"
3,"Yays  1. Very simple, understandable investment approach - invest across stocks and bonds, auto rebalancing 2. Straightforward interface, reasonable fees  Nays 1. Their approach is so simple that it makes you wonder why you're paying them to do it for you"
3,"I actually took an in depth look at both StashAway and AutoWealth, and I prefer Autowealth because they don't have an opaque ""re-optimisation"" regime, and it is a lot easier to adjust the equity-bond mix.  However, a number of key problems remain: 1. Heavy allocation to bonds 2. No allocation to REITs 3. High Fees 4. Withholding Tax  Personally, I still prefer DIY investing, simply because of the fees. A 0.5% fee requires the robo to outperform the index by 0.5% which is incredibly hard, and I do not feel that they do enough to justify their hefty fees.  Full review at https://financialhorse.com/autowealth-1/  "
5,Used AW since Sept 2017. Hassle-free and low-cost.
5,"Starting up with AutoWealth is straightforward and everything is done smoothly. Good interface and user friendly. It comes with a higher barriers to entry of $3,000 compared to other similar platforms but has a low management fee of 0.5%."
5,"Been about 2 months since I opened an account - my assigned advisor was very patient in explaining how autowealth works, what are the risks etc and I asked sooo many questions but she helped clarified on the spot. Easy and convenient to log into the website and check my portfolio. So far so good :)"
4,"So far so good.   Sign up process is easy and smooth, though alot of forms and information to fill up.  You get a saxo viewer account to view the ETFs held in your name. Gives peace of mind that if anything happen at least the holdings are there.  Timely updates on rebalancing and buy/sell of ETF units via emails.  "
5,"Their website is easy to use, and they will assign an advisor to you before you put any investments with them. Their advisor is also very responsive on WhatsApp!   Although the min sum is higher at 3k, however it also means that the funds are held under your name in a custodian account. Makes it a bit more secure I feel?  It's a good way to enter the US market if you have no clue how to do it yourself.. like me! üòÇ"
4,First started investing Oct 17. Have seens good returns since then till the market correction around Feb 18( fluctuating up and down till now - still in positive range)  . Seems to be the only one where an advisor is assigned to you personally for setting up account and answer your queries when needed.   Minimum investment amount is 3000sgd but is converted to USD for investment in US market.   Investment in a pool of different US etfs and bonds which are quite diversified.  Able to choose different portfolios ranging from low risk to high risk based on your preferences.  
5,Signed up last month! US Market was down! Today I am slowly seeing the returns! Turns out they have a $20 referral bonus and is quite a feasible amount ($15 USD) for your own portfolio! Do try out their interface and get answers through their friendly agents!   Hit me up if you have any questions! 
5,"Just started w/AW since Feb and the experience has been good so far.  My favorite part of the experience is that the Customer service channels (whatsapp, email or RM) have been really responsive.  The portfolio mix of ETFs are pretty well known to me so no trouble understanding AW's selection. The UI is straightforward, and have no trouble accessing it, even on my phone (yes I don't really need an apps). The information presented so far is exactly what I need."
5,"Highly recommended for any savvy investor who wishes to sit back and enjoy the automation of investing at low cost, especially for beginning investors. Different risk level (1-4) caters to different risk appetites. Diversification of portfolio maximise returns for long term financial goals/ savings. Every transaction is transparent and updated on the platform. Overall 5 stars in product n service "
5,"-The AW online on-boarding process is convenient and my account was set up within a week.  -Platform is informative, easy to comprehend and user friendly. It truly put my mind as ease knowing that my investments are well taken care of. -Upon opening account online, wealth manager personally contact me via text and patiently answers any question through whatapps.   I will strongly recommend AW to my family and friends. "
5,"Tried out and still have stakes in 3 of the local robo advisors. So far autowealth has definitely been my favorite though at the beginning I liked StashAway as the UI looks more flashy. Autowealth simply provides you with more info about the performance of your portfolio but still manages to keep the UI neat and beautiful, which you only start to appreciate more as it sinks in. And I like their f2f onboardig experience too, which I believe would become the different-or for autowealth if they keep working on improving further. It sort of gives you the chance to get to know the team behind the product and adds some personal touch. Keep on the good work and probably consider bringing a bit more varitety of ETFs into your portfolio mix?"
5,"Pros: +I like their hybrid advisory model, they ensure that every user gets face time with their certified financial adviser +Returns are good and the cost is low, they deliver high value +Good on-boarding experience Cons: -UI is a little bit difficult to navigate"
5,"Have been using AutoWealth since Oct 2017, returns so far 5+% on a Balanced profile. Really like how easy the initial set up was and the rate of response of the Wealth Manager(Kai Chuen).  The methodology is easy to understand and you can check transactions when you log into your account.   Returns are affected by USD fx. But will be using AutoWealth for the long term so it's not too much of a biggie for now.  Overall, I'd recommend AutoWealth to my friends and family."
5,"I have been using AW since April 2016. Returns are high, the platform is easy to use and fuss-free. Advice (human touch) is just a Whatsapp message away, which is reassuring to someone with minimal experience in investing. Keep up the good work!"
5,"Autowealth has been part of my portfolio since October 2017. The signing up experience with Autowealth was pretty smooth and new portfolio was constructured a week after the KYC process with the RM. So far my balanced portfolio has achieved 5.31%(2.5 months) since inception on 25th Oct 2017. Among other robo-advisors that I have, one of the best part of Autowealth which I like is they clearly define the portfolio weightage for Asia, Europe and emerging markets."
5,"Using it since Oct 2017, with 6.75% return so far.  Stable returns and better than UT.  Recommend for the transparency in trades and friendly advisor.  "
5,"Have been using since last year December. I have also used other Robo-advisor before. I recommend AW to others mainly because of its transparency and to be able to have our own SAXO account, which I think was important as we are our money is safe (this is the part better than other robo-advisor). However, there is still room for improvement - AW should improve the current platform as it's can be rather buggy at times (some page bring you back to login when the session is still active), that the lack of forex taking into consideration when showing the returns and lastly the lack of multiple platforms. A lot of process such as account opening and creating a new portfolio is also strictly via the wealth manager only, which has not been a problem since the wealth manager has been rather responsive, but it might serve a problem in the future when more people are using. Not too sure if this is intended for compliance purposes.  Tldr - so far so good, will definitely recommend to others for the sake of the transparency. But in terms of the platform, it's definitely not the best."
5,"Been a client since Oct 2017. Some see the onboarding process which requires face-to-face contact to be cumbersome, but I see it as a robo-advisor with a human touch. After the initial meet and set up, depositing funds becomes as easy as making a bank transfer. Very easy to WhatsApp your point-of-contact on Autowealth issues or queries. 2 points to improve on: it would be great if Autowealth could accept funds from PayPal to be deployed directly. Also the flat 0.5% fee should have a cap, as it becomes more untenable as the value of an investment portfolio grows. Past a certain amount (I think >$100k), its fees are no longer as competitive as other robo-advisors."
5,"On AW for 3 months and service has been prompt, user friendly interface and decent returns so far. Very transparent as you can see your holdings in saxo. Highly recommended."
5,"I have being using AutoWealth (AW) for a few months. Staying true to the story that AW establish when the founders started AW, the intention is to help investors to deliver better returns. Unlike investment alternatives that are currently in the market which charges high distribution cost and subsequently corrode the long term returns, AW simple investment philosophy allows investor to achieve better returns.  Comparing my own portfolio and AW portfolio, I also observe that AW provides a much lower monthly volatility which provided a peace of mind for me to hold long term. I will likely attribute this to the Index that AW selects which enable this to be possible. Likewise, comparing to the unit trust that I have, the strategy deployed by AW is sound and easily understood. This motivated me to take the first step to try this out.  Nonetheless, robo-investing and index investing is still a relatively new development to Singapore market. However, since Warren Buffett won the bet that S&P 500 stock index would outperform hedge funds, I will also wants to place my bets on AW. In the long run, I believe I would have saved plenty of time to following AW strategy and spend these precious time doing what I am passionate on.  "
4,"I have signed up a portfolio with AutoWealth of 60% equity and 40% bond since Sept. 2017 and the cumulative return to date about 6.7%. This rate of return is much better than Unit Trust that I have had bought in the past and in addition, it's fee is also lower than UT.  I'm waiting for next round of AutoWealth promotion to top up my fund if the fund performance continues to be good.  Platform wise is user-friendly and easy to understand.      "
5,"Very good and prompt service, caters to individual needs, very transparent, returns have been as per what wealth manager says thus far"
4,"Used it since Oct 2017, they're very transparent with dividends, current and historical portfolio value and are proactive with rebalancing. Onboarding was detailed and smooth and had the element of human touch. The account manager is extremely approachable and answers queries promptly.  Only gripe I have is with their web interface, which is the only interface available - it logs me out right after I log in sometimes so that I have to log in thrice most of the time. And it shows my NRIC when I first login which makes checking on the go (e.g on the train)  less possible since I don't want people to see my NRIC."
5,"Easy to use platform, with transparency on trade records and dividends. Provided good returns in line with market :) I am glad I set up an education fund for my child last year! "
2,"Not using.  Cons Requires a meet up with relationship manager to set up account. It can't be done online. To me, that defeats the purpose of robo advisory if we need to go through a relationship manager.   It needs a separate saxo account to be set up.  It does not deal in fractional shares so if you intend to invest small amounts every month, a part of the sum will be left as cash as some etf are quite expensive.  Single fixed rate of 0.5% charges. It is not staggered where higher levels of investment can allow you to enjoy lower rates.  Needs minimum sum of $3000 as initial investment"
5,"I am holding one portfolio (80% equity, 20% bond)  the wealth manager is very approachable and addressed all my concerns adequately as I was not familiar with their product. after speaking to him about my personal investment goals and him sharing about Autowealth's investment strategy, I decided to invest in them.   I can easily monitor the growth of my portfolio, tracking the breakdown across the various ETFs. This makes it easy for me to know which component is doing better, useful for people who wants to know more about their investment.   The cost is straightforward and transparent: 0.5% + US$18 per annum of the asset.   Will definitely continue to use Autowealth and recommend to know anyone who are looking for alternatives to unit trusts, ILPs and other similar investment products. "
5,"The team is reliable and trustworthy. I do my own stock investments too and I am actually skeptical about Singapore ETFs -- I don't own any Singapore ETFs. I signed up mainly to gain access to Vanguard Total Stock ETF at lower fees (my monthly quantum is $400 and other brokers are more expensive). With a leap of faith, I signed up on 25 Aug 2017. So far, the returns are calculated as 10.1% (as at 15 Jan 2018) with the allocation of 80% equities and 20% bonds,  but after factoring USD exchange rate, it's probably -0.5%.  I don't know how long they can maintain their fees, but I will stay on for as long as it remains."
5,"I have been a customer since end August 2017. The growth is steady and more promising than many other instrument that are of similar risk level. The staff is approachable, fast responding and is really just one-whatsapp-away. I will continue to use Autowealth and also to refer to my friends! "
5,"Currently holding only 1 portfolio (conservative; 60% bonds, 40% equity).  Simple maintenance of account by just injecting funds on a monthly basis. It is automatically allocated to certain ETFs (with rebalancing).  Good alternative to savings/investment plans for global exposure.  Thus far, the experience with Autowealth has been good. RM is very helpful and responsive, and there is high level of transparency on how they allocate your funds through a comprehensive online platform detailing gains over the months with graphical breakdowns.  "
5,"I have been with Autowealth since Aug 2017. I opened the account via meeting up a RM (KC). It was a fast and pleasant account opening experience since I knew exactly what I wanted. I was doing what AutoWealth was doing by myself for a couple of years but the hassle of having to deal with US brokerages and the time taken put me off. The portfolio constructed mirrored something I would have done on by own. I checked against the competitor but did not like the ETFs selected. Account Funding was easy. I put in a small amount to test out the system. Autowealth was something even my private banker is not able to offer me. So I would say I'm a happy and satisfied customer.   I'm waiting for Autowealth to get the necessary accreditation so I can invest my couple hundred k in my SRS funds in Autowealth.  Having written this review, I sometimes think you can't have the best of everything so just give-and-take. Most importantly, you must be comfortable with the decision you take "
4,"Pros:  - Platform is detailed in terms of listing daily returns, monthly returns all in one page  - Funds are received and allocated much faster than Stashaway  Cons: - troublesome to construct additional portfolios, had to contact the RM  - minimum investment and withdrawal sum puts me off abit as it is not as liquid  Returns: The profile 2 (moderately aggressive?*) portfolio is newly set up and hence inappropriate for comments. the Profile 4 (most aggressive) portfolio is doing great so far, 6.02 % cumulative returns since 14/11/2017	  *self created term (disclaimer)"
5,"The Good: + Low fees up to a certain cap, check out other Seedly or BudgetBabe posts for fees breakdown + One on one meeting with Michael, Head of Wealth Advisory. Helps to put face to company and a business contact in your Whatsapp + Relatively high returns of 2.4% in 2 months. Invested a low 4 figure sum, earned a low 3 figure sum already  The Bad: - Platform is more plain and non-intuitive than Stashaway  Verdict: + High returns, low fees"
5,I signed up an AutoWealth account and it was in-force since 24 August 2017 . The portfolio's cumulative returns at the time of this writing is 6.24% . The wealth manager has been professional in the signing up process and addressing my queries. Highly recommended!
4,"Good point: Good coverage for many countries/currencies.  Meets my needs for family remittances between AU and Europe and given the many currencies supported, should have no issue for most reasonable use cases. "
5,"Long term user (set up initial account 5 years back).  * Good point: Good coverage for many countries/currencies.  Meets my needs for family remittances between AU and Europe and given the many currencies supported, should have no issue for most reasonable use cases.  * Mixed point:  The initial onboarding a bit of a hassle.  On the plus side, you can rely on these guys coz they take compliance seriously, but on the downside, it means their KYC process can be a bit heavy.  Esp. for users in SEA - as a UK based company they may not be super familiar with users here.  Case in point, I am from AU and working in SEA with remittance needs to EU - not their normal average case.  But they did pull through (ended up with a call with a real person (!!) and after explaining situation and some paperwork - did push through).  * Bad point: actual conversion process a bit annoying - need to fund account first (a few days from bank transfer) followed by conversion - so you can't be certain of FX rate until account funded (and if it is funded and you find a better rate elsewhere - then tough luck the money is with them already).  There is some frictional costs with fund disbursement (fees associated with crediting local accounts).  The lack of ability to compare certainly take sheen off.  * Neutral point - pure FX provider so more limited offering compared to other providers that do travel credit cards, business accounts etc etc (a neutral point only; after all do-one-thing-well can be a virtue)  Overall  rates turned out competitive so have pushed through quite a bit through their system (over course of few years) .   In my portfolio as provider to compare when doing high value FX transfer "
5,"FSM Maps is a digital portfolio of both active and passive funds, charges a low 0.5% advisory fee, and is very accessible for a small capital to start and taps on the expertise of the biggest fund distributor platform in Singapore iFast (as they're the parent company).  If you're looking for not a pure passive approach as most other robos provide, this platform is for you. "
5,"I have been on this policy since I was a kid for over 10 years now. It is really useful and good. Easy to maintain the policy as well, since our agent dumped us sadly.  Update: I just submitted a claim Just sharing the importance of insurance (and private insurance) for everyone here! Because we are in Seedly we really need to know and take action yup. I had a recent Dengue fever and was warded for 3D2N, amount worked out to be $3,505. I could go to the A&E and there was not much queueing > compared to public hospitals. :)  So now I manage my own Hospitalisation plan DIY. My dad had to be warded a ton in 2016 and 17 and it was straightforward to do the claims, mainly by going down to the pop-up branches at NEX and AMK HUB to do the claims.  So far, highly recommend it, the interface online is great as well. What could be improved would be the mobile app and the rewards portion... yup!"
5,Enhanced IncomeShield is a. Medisave- approved Integrated Shield Plan (IP) that gives you assurance that your hospital and surgical.
4,"Enhanced IncomeShield/IncomeShield also covers you for certain benefits that are not included under MediShield Life. This includes coverage for pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses, emergency overseas treatment, and the option to purchase riders to cover deductibles and co-insurance."
5,"If all your documents are correct and ready and you have the patience to wait for over a month for the claim to be settled, then the experience with NTUC Insurance can be pleasing. Keep chasing the status with your agent, if you have one, to ensure things keep moving and keep track of the status to close it at the earliest"

1,Sold my car and wasn't aware of this. Becareful of fine lines. Does not allow prorate refund. If you decide to cancel.
3,"A pity to be once stuck with Starhub's archaic data-hungry plans. Never happier to switch to Circles after they launched. Now that Starhub has introduced giga, I'm definitely considering coming back to Starhub."
4,"Starhub's Data Travel Plans are amazing, and easy to get on within the app itself.   In terms of existing postpaid plans, definitely room for improvement though. More data for postpaid, pretty please? "
3,"Had a hard time with billing. My paper bills were switched to the digital bills a few times without my consent and I ended up missing my payments.   The connection is generally ok, but sometimes while at home, my reception changes to a Malaysian one."
3,"Currently using the SIM Only plan @ $20/month for 15GB + 100 min outgoing call + free caller ID + unlimited weekend data. Have been on the plan for 4 months.  Pros: unlimited weekend data is fantastic and $20 a month with no contract is decent; coverage is comparable to Singtel and M1 imo (was a user under them 1 and 2 years ago respectively); customer service on Facebook is good and replies quickly to resolve issues; data roaming prices are decent for certain countries; cheapest out of all the telcos for line suspension (5.35 per month)  Cons: a few SMS (maybe 5-10?) would be appreciated; idk why they bill me even before the month is up; sometimes I get weird charges for overseas SMS even tho I never travelled to the borders of Singapore, so please read your bill very carefully!! Don't call them if you can because the wait is horrendous. I don't know why this has not changed in the past 15 years.  Overall, for the price, I am content but the whole customer service experience can be improved upon.  *Previously with Singtel and I enjoyed their Singtel wifi at various locations because it helped me to save on data but with Wireless@SG there's really no advantage to be with Singtel anymore~ Just go for whichever SIM only plan which is the most cost effective!"
4,"I'm on StarHub's XS mobile plan ($36/mth). The connection and speed both Indoors and outdoors are good. Connection issues are very rare. Its service is reliable compared to other telcos, especially when I'm inside the MRT train. The Customer Service Officers are helpful too.   The only con is the higher price for its XS mobile plan compared to other mobile plans.  I'll switch to a cheaper plan that offers a reasonable service after my current plan expires."
3,"I‚Äôm currently using no-Sim plan whereby my monthly bill is only $22.90 and when I applied there‚Äôs a promo code that give $5 discount for 24 months since I do it online, bringing my monthly bill to $17.90. The pro of this plan is the unlimited weekend data usage, which really helps a lot otherwise it‚Äôs only 6GB a month. The con would be the limited calling time of 100 minutes and 0 text msg. I‚Äôm able to use WhatsApp call and to migrate this :) Love the cheap bill ! "
4,"I have been using Starhub ever since I got a phone. I have been using a 2-year based contract. It is stable with occasional loss in signal.(Which is decent)   However, I feel my current plan is no longer serving my data needs from the increasing array of apps that consume lots of data. So, I will look to other options!"
4,"Switched from M1. Been 3 months and so far so good. The experience signing up was good, with helpful customer service people there. I like the interface of the app, and it tells me how much data im using. Free weekend data so I have plenty of data to use (they had some sort of promotion so I have 20GB of free data monthly as well). Just a little gripe though. I called starhub helpline (for my internet issue) previously, and it counted all that time (even tho i dialed 1800) as talktime used up. I nearly busted my 100mins due to it. So whoever's intending to use Starhub and don't have a home phone like me, do be careful when calling helplines, even Starhub's. "
5,I signed up under the corporate plan for Starhub Sim-only XS plan @ $24/mth which includes free 3gb data on TOP of the 3gb given. There‚Äôs also free weekend data and free caller I‚Äôd. 6gb is enough for my monthly data usage so thus this plan is perfect for me as I don‚Äôt intend to get any phone. Contract is 1 year.
5,"APPLICATION?  Application process via online is relatively easy. StarHub‚Äôs offers Plan with Device and SIM-only plan (no contract) and the extremely worth it CIS plans.   ADDITIONAL SIM? Thinking of getting additional sim for work related or for someone else? In addition, M1 provides free caller number display for 3 months for new sign-ups or, enjoy free 6 months if you switch to M1. Do you smell the goodness like i do ?   Thinking of getting additional SIM for work related or for someone else? Look no further than Starhub‚Äôs SIM-only plan. At only $25/monthly, you‚Äôre entitled to 15GB data, with FREE weekend data (10GB/day on Sat and Sun). Still worried about not enough data? Get 50GB data with worry-free data for $5.40/month. Online exclusive: $120 bill rebate!   Thinking of porting over to StarHub under 2-year plan or CIS plans (depending on your company benefits)? For just $50/monthly for 2-year plan, you‚Äôre entitled to 15GB data, with FREE weekend data (10GB/day on Sat and Sun). Still worried about not enough data? Get 50GB data with worry-free data for $5.40/month.    CONNECTION STRENGTH? Undoubtedly, this telco connection impressed me. Whilst travelling regardless of in tunnel or at camp sites, there isn‚Äôt a significant drop in the connection signal as compared to my previous telco (not pointing fingers). Ragnarok M definitely require good connection signal at all times for MVP hunt.   Personally, I feel that Starhub‚Äôs weekend free 10GB data is the best out of all the telco so far.  "
5,"Have been using Starhub for many years. Overall, very reliable service and mobile application is useful for checking mobile usage/bills. But have to pay for caller ID and also for exceeding data even if it's just by a little bit. Upgraded to the new $50 plan during the promotion last December as my old phone died. Got a Samsung Galaxy S9 at a competitive price, monthly bill about $43 after Hub Club discount as I'm using both broadband and fibre TV from Starhub too. Plan gives me free caller ID, 15GB of data, 100 mins of calls but 0 SMS. "
4,I have been leveraging my first 2 companies' CIS (Corporate Individual Scheme). I have always found StarHub CIS come up cheaper than SingTel CIS. Loyal customer of 7+ years :)
2,"I am using the Postpaid plan. I like the improved Starhub App that allows a lot of monitoring and even customisation to the plans as and when needed. BUT, I realised when they upgrade their plans, the previous customers suffer. My mum is still on an old plan that gives the least but charges more than my current plan. When asked, they said, oh! she is under contract so need to first finish before switching to the new plan. C'mon! "
3,"good but getting more expensive,the add ons does not cater to me and sharing is also not calculated correctly"
1,"the WORST customer experience I've had in ANY company of ANY kind, EVER. Like I have both broadband and mobile in TWO separate accounts not linked and they send me a 6 page PDF to fill up and send back. I cannot do GIRO and I have to pay manually as GUEST monthly. I wont do this mistake again. For sure. Oh and the broadband from Myrepublic much better."
2,"Application was speedy. I got the new plans under CIS discount, which gave me 30GB per month for $60. Additionally there was a 12months free 50GB data.  I'm literally free from the data shackles. Coverage wasn't as good as Singtel though. There are certain places which had spotty connections, and I'm talking about places such as HDB void decks or shopping malls. Occurs around 5% of the time.   Customer service is extremely responsive. And their mobile application looks great.   Value: 5/5 Signal Strength 3.5/5 Customer Service: 4/5"
1,"Horrible brand, wifi can‚Äôt even go as far as 5-10 meters. Frequent disconnections and loading issues."
4,"Currently on the $25 SIM-only plan (12-month contract I think) with $5 bill rebate for 6 months ($5 bill rebate is before GST).   Some background: used to be on a 24-month contract with StarHub, before I switched to the SIM-only XS plan, and then most recently to the latest $25 plan. I had initially wanted to switch telcos to SingTel but decided to stay with StarHub in the end (more details below).  StarHub's customer service has certainly improved over the years. While I used to have to wait on the phone for ~1h to speak to a human being, nowadays I can just send in an enquiry (via email/webform) and I will receive an email/call the next day to follow up on my case. I once even received a call on a Saturday. Really feel that they have taken steps to improve customer service and satisfaction, so kudos to them.  In contrast, I had a very bad experience with SingTel. Wanted to switch telcos but the website kept denying my attempts and told me to call their hotline. Tried calling in as asked, only to be forced to navigate through a very dumb interface -- I selected the call category that I thought was most relevant, only to be hung up upon and told to read the website (received a URL via SMS). If I had managed to find the answer online, I wouldn't have needed to call in right?? I also sent in a general enquiry via webform, and they never got back to me despite saying that they would do so within a week. I hence remained with Starhub.  Overall, StarHub's mobile coverage is pretty good and fast. Sometimes it lags a bit, but for the most part it works fine. I wish they would include free SMS in their plans (though I do recognise it's not a popular service anymore) and give bill rebates for a longer time, considering the equivalent plans in other telcos cost around $20 only. Still, it's not a dealbreaker given the great service I've had in recent times."
1,Horrible pings spikes no matter where you are. Would NEVER recommend if you want to play any mobile games. 
4,"Currently using the Sim Only plan @ $20/month for 13GB + 100 min outgoing call + Free caller ID + Unlimitted weekend data.   Switched from Zero 1 to this as I realise I only consumed about 15GB monthly from my Zero1 bill. Given my majority of data usage is during weekend (wifi at workplace), 13 GB for all weekdays in a month seems comfortable for me. And I get to use it at full speed as compared to Zero1. Speed is pretty alright, smooth and fast in West area.   Glad I got it before the unlimitted weekend data become chargeable. "
1,"Just change to Circles.Life. Been paying around 70plus for each month,for 7Gb of data.Like seriously? Giving me $100 for recontracting when i sign with them for the pass 6years,so pathetic.They just simply do not know how to appreciate loyal customer. Poor Coverage in certain areas,"
1,"My family has been a StarHub Hub Club member since the beginning. However, we‚Äôre all watching less TV and hence don‚Äôt really need its cable TV services. Reception is pretty bad at some parts of Singapore and in trains. My siblings are all also slowly switching out to Circles Life for its data plans. Additionally, they charged me around $100 for the switch even though my plan has already ended."
3,the only good thing about Starhub now is the unlimited data on weekends (starting from 0000 Saturday morning and ending on 0000 Monday morning)  I hope they can provide better data plans with lower costs
1,"I have decided to switch over to circles life yesterday with promo 8gb $28/mth after comparing my experiences with these telco + price point. I am data heavy but I connects automatically to free wifi pretty much in malls and home so every month I don't exceed 3gb (though I could since my plan is 4gb). Usually uses WhatsApp calls but occasionally still have to do normal calls for reservations etc.  SINGTEL:  Pros: 10gb/mth @ $36.05 (+2gb if switch to ST on SIM only now) comes with 150mins talk time + 500 free local SMS. Free ST wifi across Singapore if you're ST postpaid customer.  Cons: Bad service both at counter and call operator level. I was just changing my phone 6 weeks ago at ST; made appt online but got confusing SMS from ST, called them back and operator told me my collection point is at Jurong when I clearly selected AMK. After arriving at AMK I was made to wait an hour plus for nothing and no service recovery. Also, when you are tied to contract with ST they do not auto upgrade you to be on par with their new packages. Example you registered for 4gb (4g network) @ $65/mth 2 years back; even if new package is $40/mth you'll be charged at $65 even after your contract is over. Also, when I sign up for 4g network I will want 4g network say 80% of the time. Not 3g. ST cheated my feelings.  STARHUB  Pros: 6gb + unlimited weekend data @ $24 (12 mth contract) and if you're overseas you can simply turn on dataroam @ $15 for 2gb (valid 1 mth) so it's really convenient.  They also used to upgrade existing users FOC to new package so long as you're not under contract. If you were paying $65/mth for 4gb, you may notice you have 6gb because they upgraded you. They will send you a letter to inform you and this is what I like them. Don't think they are doing now though.  Cons: Technical glitches. Past 3 months I've been experiencing constant glitches from them. First I had data roam which I used in Taiwan which was okay but when I go to Malaysia the next week it couldn't connect at all. I called in to verify and all was verified ok so I entered Malaysia again the next week and again no signal. Called operator again and was told it is an IT glitch which they are trying to solve (2 weeks at least - really?) Also let's not forget their massive breakdown just last week. My phone is on SH postpaid and my home wireless is SH too. So if there's totally no signal; it's not just cable and fibre broadband issues. Their technical team needs to buck up.  Zerox:  Pros: unlimited everything for first 3000 sign ups at only $65/mth.  Cons: Not for everyone. Do you really need unlimited everything when you can get wireless pretty much everywhere now and cheaper plan @ $30 and below?  Circles life:  Pros: 8gb for $28/mth no contract and comes with 100 min talk time... Unlimited WhatsApp free and deliver the constant 4G promise. I stay and live in town but often goes around to East, North and West of SG. While I always get 3G signal in Orchard for ST & SH, circles life gave me 4G. I did a free trial with circles life last year and it certainly surprises me. Let's not forget free roaming and free caller number display which ST & SH charges for basic necessities.  Cons: No SMS but not a big deal because to be honest you can contact everyone on WhatsApp/line pretty much these days.  Sorry for the long post but this is why I chose circles life! Hopefully circles life stays competitive in terms of both pricing and service level so I can support them on a continuous basis."
3,I really love starhub. But personally I felt starhub is losing out on its market capitalization. Would really hope starhub bucks up and adapts to the current market!
4,Helpfully and The quality and good service and Understanding and good helping and I hope can be more promotion 
3,Starhub hotline is difficult to call in and waiting time is too long. It does not provide us details like when we should change our mobile number for the main line.
5,"Is a good telco that you can be lucky to see your star from hong kong to korea, kpop star when they are promoting their songs or events "
4,"My phone doesn't always get reception. But when I overuse my data I always get notifications, which is great. The customer service is also prompt and efficient. "
5,"I am a customer for starhub for over around 18 years. They have always been very helpful whenever i need help because they always help me very quickly.   Starhub has great customer service, i hope they will keep it up."
4,"The starhub hub is what draws me to it, discount if I use the broadband, mobile, and TV together. Given that my parents are too old to understand Netflix, Starhub is my only choice, so I took the broadband and mobile too to save.  The mobile signal is weak when they started years ago, but thankfully the strength is pretty good almost everywhere now"
5,"Using prepaid card and i would say the Price is competitive , reasonable , and signal is strong. Customer service is way better than other telco."
3,"It was really average, most of the time I got a strong 4G signal but it is a pain with no data coverage in certain area i.e. underground of Tanah Merah MRT, my office toilet, etc. :P"
3,"I am using starhub postpaid phone. I am very old customer. There are many benefits of we go out side, I feel StarHub should much better for existing customers. I always feel other vendors are much better in terms of value to money.This time I am seriously thinking to switch."
4,"Had been with the, for nearly 10 years and I had zero problem with them. Love their online store for recontact.   Will need improvement for the delivery personal. Experience 2 time and they are always very rush.  It like loanshark asking you to sign paper.  "
1,The most annoying mobile network is starhub. 4G network is very poor.  Please don't choose starhub. it is helpless even during emergency.
2,"I recently subscribe StarHub cable TV which require me to get the starhub optic fibre 5GHz line. But the reception is poor, when I use my mobile to link to carousel and Anime website it was blocked. I am very disappointed with Starhub broadband."
1,"weak/unstable 4G data converage/penetration. i live in the central of Singapore, ang mo kio and sometimes like 70% of the times, the 4G signal/ penetration is so weak/unstable that i can't load on insta and play Brawl Stars. starhub should test their 4G signal penetration over house/office walls and at basement, espeically in ang mo kio. i am definitely changing to other telco after my current contract ends with starhub."
2,Customer service not too great. Fibre was down for a whole week and starhub took a really long time to get back to us. Had to go through so many people to get the issue resolved. 
4,"Ever since I changed to this Green telco, everything has been smooth, the app is really user friendly and easy to navigate. UI 100!"
1,They are not giving you back your S$200 deposit after terminating or ending your contract with them. It has been almost 5 months since I ended my contract with Starhub but until now i have not heard from them.  WORSE and TERRIBLE customer service. PLEASE DO NOT USE STARHUB NETWORK!!!. Thanks
2,"Just switch over to Circleslife, no contract, and easily change or customise your plan using your app. And get rewarded with cummulative permanent free 500MB of data for every 6months you stay with Circleslife. www.circles.life"
1,Starhub has the lousiest customer service. They messed up our connections in the move to fiber and to date we cannot have a workable solution despite filing many complains. We will have to find other vendors.
3,"I bought match ticket for july to watch in singapore since 17/04/2019, and until now i e-ticket is still not available to download yet. It's my first time using starhub, that make me so concern since they have deducted my balance already. does anyone experienced buying something thru Starhub before? Please share some experiences."
1,"My family has been using StarHub for many years. I recently started Taking control of my own phone bill and had to deal with SO MANY issues with StarHub after I recontracted. In light of the recent competition, they currently offer better plans with more data, but customer service is absolutely sub par"
1,"I am using Starhub for over 10 years. I got a second sim for $15 per month starting last year. Suddenly my $15 service plus changed to $100.9346 per month in Nov last year.  I complained to their CS and their feedback was I terminated the $15 service plus myself from their iphone app and it would automatically switch to $100 plan.  I didn't know this option, never did it and I also cannot find this option in the app. Even there is an option to terminate the second sim, why activate a $100 plan for me?  It is totally a scam. No more ""Scamhub"" for the rest of my life."
1,Horrible customer care service. Pathetic sales. You will hit your head to the wall if you plan to buy a plan with them. more over they seems like scammer. Not at all recommended.
1,"For those whoever written whatever comments, i just called starhub, i feel like talking to scam people at india department. Hmm hmm not anymore starhub doesn't worth a star or less than that. Termination sucks!"
1,the data is horrible barely works at all no way there is a problem with my phone cos i just got a brand new phone
1,Horrible customers service. Send an sms to confirm the date for the technician to come and was cancelled without informing me. I have to rush back from work just for this appointment.  Called up to hotline and waited for more than 45 minutes!!! 
1,"I been using Starhub mobile since 2000 when they just started.  Used to give royalty rewards for contract renewal, now they do not appreciate royal customer anymore.  Bad 4G coverage."
4,"Love their sim only plan. 6GB + unlimited weekend data @ $24 (12 mth contract)  Various data plans available when you travel overseas, 1GB, 2GB, 3GB or pay as you roam with all easy sms activation. Notification would be sent to you as well when you are near your data limit.  Roaming data can be used for different countries within 30days depending on the bundle selected. Very convivent for those who travels quite a bit for work."
3,"10 years since i‚Äôve Been using this. Please stop the crazy prices. Just convert to Sim-only plans, their prices are not competitive at all and not attractive.   Time to go to circles"
4,"been using starhub for a few years. ever since theres 4G, my data (4GB - old plan) kept exceeding even though i am not a heavy user.   now i changed to the new sim only 12mths plan. unlimited wkend data plus 6gb wkday data. less than $30 per month. never used my freecalls as i am using the whatsapp calls etc.  my old plan was $60+ per month, this meant i can save the extra $30 to invest.  this is a good deal. win-win for consumers."
4,"Been using for years, 5GB for $45 with student card, 200min and unlimited SMS. Nothing much to complain about, a reasonable deal. "
4,"I have been using StarHub for many years and am generally satisfied with the reliable service. As I am familiar with it‚Äôs roaming plans and data upsize options, will continue to use StarHub to save the hassle of switching to another telco. "
4,"I've been w starhub since 2010-ish, when i was in jc. It was the cheaper option then, and i stuck to it out of habit. Then when i started work, the corporate discount was 30% so it's a pretty good deal for me to carry on. I've contemplated switching to a sim-only plan but upon calculation, it was cheaper for me to renew my corporate plan and get a new phone (s7 in 2017) along with it.  My home wifi which is also under starhub has problems every now and then, but at times like that I'm thankful my data still works fine. Connectivity is intermittent sometimes when underground and in lifts, but it seems to be a common problem across telcos so I'm not too hung up on it. "
4,"I had been a StarHub subscriber since 2003 and the true value for me had been the savings from having the full suite of services available.  I had been a HubClub member since it started and most of the time a Platinum Club member.  The savings I get from these are pretty significant in the range of $20-30 each month.  Besides that HubClub allows me to recontract annually on one of my plans which allowed me to buy a new iPhone every time it is launched and make money selling the old one (the 2nd price is more than the recontract price I have to pay).  This is even more savings for me. So I wouldn't say the reception is excellent, and there are a couple of blindspots along certain expressways but they  dont really give me too much heartpain considering the savings i get over the years and just that few times when the poor reception bothers me."
3,Has a really good welcome offer when I first signed-up but realised after a while that I didn't want my miles to be bounded to a single loyalty programme and applied for a general miles card instead.   This is good as an entry-level miles card with its low-income requirement and I must say that AMEX still has one of the best customer experience. 
1,Customer Service is horrible. They will always end the call saying that they will follow up and call you back but nobody will call you back. They promised me vouchers for signing up and it has been 2 months now and I am still chasing for the vouchers. Most horrible customer service I have ever encountered. Definitely not recommending this card or any AMEX Card. Such a bad impression for a good brand name.
1,"This card is only useful for the sign up bonus, other than that, I would suggest using a card that earns 4mpd. However, there are some credit as to why this card might be useful.  Pro: Miles earned on this card will be directly credited into your Krisflyer account 1,500 KrisFlyer miles each, for the first two approved Supplementary Cards From time to time there are some promo tied to the card that will allow you to get the best out of your $ and earn some miles Amex customer service is really awesome!  Cons: An Amex general spending card limits your use (Not all merchant accepts Amex) Low mile rate  If you plan to get this card, its' best to monitor the sign up bonus before applying. Once you hit the bonus, sock drawer this card!"
5,American Express Krisflyer Attractive sign up bonus and its easy to use to accumulate your miles. Had a good experience with their customer service.
3,Easiest miles card as no conversion into KF account is required. Monthly auto ‚Äúsweeping‚Äù of miles hence save in the conversion fee. 
3,This card is fairly good if you are a mile person. Easy to get miles for every expenses. The call center service is absolutely awesome 
5,Is a great card that help you to make your dream come true to your favourite destination when you use your kris miles 
5,Got this credit card since few months ago. Good sign up bonus during that time and excellent customer service.
4,"Fast application process, I applied on Monday, received card on Wednesday. Pretty decent signup bonus and miles earning especially if you use Grab as they give extra 2 miles per dollar at the moment."
4,I am very impressed by Amex customer service. They take ownership of customers‚Äô complaints. The mileage earned are pretty decent.
3,"It allows me to earn 2 miles on my SIA tickets for each dollar earned and there is no transfer fee for the miles to be transferred. However do note that if the SIA tickets is not purchased online but via the phone or at the service centre, it doesn‚Äôt qualify for the 2 miles and only 1.1 miles will be awarded for $1 spent. I don‚Äôt really understand this logic since the tickets are all sold by SIA. Also tickets purchased via phone or counter are subjected to handling fees. By using this card we are penalised again for not buying online. Sometimes the website is down and we just have no choice but to buy via call. Hope they can change this feature since UOB KrisFlyer credit card provides 3miles regardless of channel of purchase. That‚Äôs all the feedback I have."
5,Easy way to accrue miles directly to krisflyer account with out needing to pay a miles conversion fee.   Pros - Quite easy to get a annual fee waiver.  - Hassle free way to accumulate miles.   Cons - some what below par mpd compared to other credit cards.  - Miles are accumulated at the end of each month to your krisflyer account. So miles would expire if not utilized with in 3 years. 
5,"I love this Kris flyer scheme. Upon sign up, Receive a bonus of 5,000 KrisFlyer miles the very first time you charge to your Card. Apply online by 30th June 2018 to receive an additional 2,000 KrisFlyer miles. And best of all,  the KrisFlyer miles you earn are transferred automatically to your KrisFlyer account with no transfer fee.  I applied before 31 May, and received a free one night stay at Oasis Hotel in Novena.  It's one of the best perks for me at the moment.  "
3,"Excellent sign up bonus. This card is great for bypassing the miles conversation ""service"" fee. On top of which, I also enjoyed AMEX promotions from time to time with this card. A handy AMEX card which I keep in my Samsung pay and wallet."
1,"Good signup bonuses on the KF Blue/Ascend. Good bonus miles promotions from time to time (mobile payments +4mpd, grab +2mpd, etc) Otherwise useless."
1,"AMEX Singapore Krisflyer allows direct crediting of miles into your KrisFlyer account, this enables you to bypass the nasty conversion fees some other bank's credit cards have when converting the particular bank's points into Airmiles.  In terms of general, the AMEX card does not have a good best miles to expenditure ratio among the credit cards (S$1 = 1.1 Miles for genreal expenditure.  UOB PRiVi Miles is a better card for gerneal expenditure due to its 1.4 ratio and that is Visa, which is accepted in more stores in Singapore than AMEX. The special advantage of this AMEX card though is that for those who grab often, you get a S$1 = 3 Miles. Hence this card is definitely good for people who want the miles and are frequent Grab customers. Otherwise, there are better air mile cards out like there (e.g. UOB Privi Miles)"
5,"I helped my parents to change from SP Group to Ohm in April 2018 as the website allows me to use the calculator to calculate how much we could save. The website is really useful in calculating the electricity bills and that's what attracted me plus the modern design. My family and I decided to test water and signed a fixed ohm plan for 6 months with them at 17.15 cents/kWh. Unfortunately, fast forward to 5 months later, they sent me a plan renewal notice and the 6 months fixed ohm plan will be charging at 18.15 cents/kWh. I know that they also have no choice but to mark up the price as SP Group increased the electricity tariffs. But hey at least this retailer is charging at a better rate (not the best fixed price in the market though). Now I've changed my plan to a 12 months fixed plan at 17.95 cents/kWh with existing customer incentives. So far, I'm pretty satisfied with Ohm and how easy it was for me to change supplier from SP Group to Ohm and changing plans after my current plan expires and I encourage my friends to use Ohm."
4,"Sign up for Ohm discount 22% when OEM just started in Jurong. Their sign up bonus very attractive especially discount 50% on first two month electricity bill and referral discount of $20.  However, recently Ohm can be further improve by launching more competitive price plan and promotion to retain existing customer.  "
4,"I was enticed by the 22% discount when the energy market was first released. And reading the first write up from Seedly blog (was interested in a fuss free Plan first) and confirmed not much administrative to be done, signed up with Ohms. Fast forward, about 1 month before renewal, they sent an email to check on what plans I wished to continue. By Sep, their pricing is not so competitive, but they did give me additional discount. 5%. A rough calculation tell me to save my brain cell and renew. This time fixed rate and the saying goes... energy cost seldom go down. Only up. So renewed under fixed price for 2 years. Set and forget."
5,TLF is absorbed.  6/ 12/ 24 months comes with 3 months trial period - can look see look see They also offer a no-contract version. Security deposit is automatically taken from SP group. Bill is generated together with SP group. $20 referral fee given to both the person referring and the person signing up. No cap on referral. Fast response and prompt followups through their online website form.
5,"3-months free trial, Fuss free sign-up & integrated with existing sp bills Fast respond of customer service"
5,"Very good and responsive customer service when I signed up 6 months ago (22% off regular tariff).   Didn‚Äôt need to contact them since. They honored their signup offer of 50% off first two months for the first 100 customers (due to language ambiguity they extended the offer to first 3 bills). Also got $20 off for being refered by someone else.  What I like also about the signup process is that ohm uses SP services as their biller; so no complication of dealing with 2 bills or paying an additional deposit to your new electricity provider.   Their 6 month contract discount off tariff plan was the cheapest when I signed up. But now that tariffs have gone up, the fixed rate offered by other retailers are more attractive. So am thinking of switching.. purely due to price and the assumption that oil prices will continue to stay high for the next 1-2 years."
5,"Signed up on a fixed rate for a 6-mth contract and all is good! Intending to extend with ohm for a 24-mth contract! Transiting from SP to ohm was a breeze and straightforward, customer service was on point and there is no issues with the electricity supply during the transition and moving forward. :)"
5,"#TeamOhm awesomely responsive customer support and flexible plan (Option to switch out or within in the 1st 3 months) are the reasons why I chose to switch to them.   Everyone should change a supplier in the open electricity market for savings. There are no drawbacks of doing so. In particular, there is no such worry of ‚Äúblackouts‚Äù or ‚Äúunreliable electricity supply‚Äù as SP group is still operating the national power grid."
5,"I switched to Ohm in Jan 2019.  Prices are not the most competitive however I was convinced this was the right company to sign up for.  1. Ohm Energy representatives knew their products and the market and are very open about it. I met them at the roadshow.  When it all first started, the market was in a mess. Some companies were charging TLF (Transmission Loss Factor) consumption, some weren't.   Ohm Energy representatives were quick to respond and update their online presence to inform the public.   2. Integrated Billing with SP Group, means my parents would not need to 'CHANGE' anything in their lifestyle. Arrangement of Giro payment to SP Group still goes on  3. Calculator on the Website made it clear and easy which plan should i go for based on my consumption. I didn't go for the cheapest (see next reason)  Note: If you wish to go the Market Ohm Product, you would need to invest $40 to switch to an AMI Meter, otherwise your usage you are charged at are not exactly how you have consumed the electricity  4. I convinced my parents by ""We can save 25% on electricity compared with our current arrangement with 10 minutes and 1 form submission"". It was too much for them to grasp if i had to explain the other Energy Products.  Note: that SP Tariff changes every quarter, so does my final per kWh payable.  What i eventually got.  1. Ohm Discount 25% with 3 month trial 2. $20 off with usage of Referral Code 3. Potential $20 off with every other referral i got 4. 50% off second and third bill (promotion) 5. SP Group Billing (Giro) - 'Dad still pays ‚úåÔ∏è' 6. Customer Portal Access to Invoices and Usage Information 7. Ohm Discount Renewal Bonus 1.5% (Currently at 26.5%) 8. Option to switch to other Price Plans  If you haven't switched, for whatever reason, you should reconsider.   All it takes is 10 min, and one online application saves you an assured 25% off  SP Group Tariff (at point of writing).   I'm sure many of you have done more to save less than this amount.  If you are really really unsure, 3 Month trial period allows you to switch if you found that   -'your electricity quality seems to have dropped' -'your fan spins slower than before' -'your air conditioning is not as cold anymore'  ..but really Electricity is electricity lahhh dont overthink things.  Switch Now if you haven't. 0 risk and 25% gains*  *Gains may differ depending on Product offerings and Retailer you are switching to. Any retailer will beat SP Tariff.  If you read everything til here, good job. If you have any questions, I will strongly recommend you to check out the FAQ on Ohm Energy website or send a quick message to them via Facebook, I assure you their Customer service is top notch.  'A dollar saved is a dollar earned' üëç"
5,Switching to OHM is good especially for foreigners like me as we wanted to save money from paying electricity. I also made a decision to switch to OHM as they have 6 months contract to no contract at all. It was just perfect for us as we only have 6 months left with our tenancy agreement. I like their referral program and they gave customers 25% off with the 2nd and 3rd bill if you qualify with the terms. 
5,"I've gotta my SP bills today, has successfully convert to ohm, and im glad i'm paying lesser than before and it did not disrupt my electric and water bills cycle. I would highly recommend you guys to sign up. "
5,"Customer service is fast in their response. Signing up is really seamless and true to their fuss-free motto. It took less than 30 minutes for everything to be done. Just remember to upload the NRIC document with the matching address, or else they will send an email to ask you to send your SP bill for address verification."
5,"OHM offers  1) no change to billing arrangement with SP Group (together with gas & water),  2) flexible after sales support via Facebook Messenger, Email or Phone & 3) 4 attractive price plans that suit your preference"
5,I signed up for the fixed rate 1 year contract and it was hassle free! It is totally transparent as per normal as the billing is still with SP and I do not have to change payment arrangements.   They have a referral code system in which the amount is automatically used to offset your electricity bills.
5,#HonestReview Why I chose OHM: - Absolutely no hidden cost - Fuss free sign up (3mins is all it takes) - Smooth transition with SP Group - Provides on-line portal for tracking - Free 6months trial 
5,"I Opt for Ohm 24-mth Fixed Rate plan @ 17.98 (lowest and same with Geneco, Keppel, etc) Choose ohm after seeing the review and and hassle-free porting over process and with integrated SP billing. Ohm is the most flexible retailer now, with short lock in and a 3 months trial where there's no penalty to terminate. "
5,Received first bill very happy with the savings almost no payment
5,Great customer service!!! hassle-free. 3-month free trial.!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Super easy sign-up. Don't need to setup new payment scheme etc as it is integrated with existing SP bill. Currently best discount deal. Given open electricity market is still fairly new, there will likely be lots more competition. Ohm allows you to switch to another service provider within 3 months without penalty.... giving you the option of able to switch if better deal comes along."
5,"went through all, and came down to keppel electric and ohm, decided on ohm because its straight forward, no hidden cost and i wanted longer contract.. "
5,"Finally decided on Ohm after research. Quick and fuss free sign up. Need to sign up using the SP account holder‚Äôs detail, which is not mine. "
5,"After comparing and reading online reviews for OEM retailers, as well as going to roadshows to find out any sign on rebates/promotion, I decided to go for Ohm Energy Pte Ltd as they definitely provide the best and promo in town. Benefits: - No separated electricity bills - you will still receive the monthly SP Power bill. Only change is that on the electricity portion, they will just put the retailer (Ohm Energy). This is important for my parents as they would not want another bill to complicate payment! This was a huge deal breaker for me actually, almost all the other retailers come as a separate bill. - No other fees, Ohm absorbs all the carbon tax and transmission loss fee, almost the same as other retailers. No security deposit needed as well - I got the fixed rate of $0.1798/kWh for 2 years plan (also almost same as other retailers). SP Group current rate is $0.2552/kWh, so already discounted about 30%. - They have 3 months trial - that means if you choose not to continue within 3 mths, you can cancel without any termination fee. This is the ONLY retailer that offers this! - **Referral programme. I have a few friends using Ohm as well, and I used their referral to get $20 rebate. likewise, you can use my referral code and we both will get $20 rebate too. and it's UNLIMITED! Which means once you get your referral code and your friends/neighbours sign up for Ohm using your code, you will get $20 rebate/sign up. - I signed today (2 Jan 2019) as they extended their current promo of 25% off second bill, till end of 2 Jan 2019. It was already all redeemed by 12pm today! The earlier promos were much better like 50% off 2nd and 3rd bill but it was already redeemed by 1 Jan 4.30am lol - Fuss free registration, literally just took 5 mins online! They sent me the welcome email within 15mins and I'm all set. Ohm is like the Circle Life of mobile plans. what I know is all electricity ultimately comes from SP group, and I basically just avoid the much smaller companies. I didn't consider Ohm for the same reason, but after reading the reviews and their super prompt customer service, definitely like no questions asked kind! I have a lot of colleagues and friends using ohm since OEM started too, and so far no issues at all. Hope my sharing will help you guys to understand more.."
5,Very effective online registration. If you are considering switching to ohm. Feel free to use my referral code. 
4,"Had done much homework last yr during Nov 18 period to jump into Ohm signing a 2 yr fixed Ohm plan. Also gotten quite a few of my friends and family to jump to Ohm too.  There was a free 1 month of electricity during the 2nd month when I signed up initially,which I felt was a very good promotion as compared to other retailers.  In additional, due to the readjustment of the fix ohm price plan to a lower price in Jan 19, I was still in the trial period to recontract to the lower price plan. This really attracted me, which I got my friends and family to join me once again and continue the 2 yrs contract till Jan 21.   The only regret I have got for Ohm is not being one of the pioneer like Jurong residents to recommend the large number of users to jump into Ohm and to allow me to get more referral bonus.  I would recommend Ohm to keep having good promotion to entice new users and better promotion to retain older users like me. One example would be if there is a readjustment of the price plan to a lower price, older user could sign up to extend their service.  There is also another issue, however it is with the billing by SP Utilities. As Ohm is tied to SP Utilities, there is no recurring credit card payment except Posb card. It would be great if there could be other credit card partners that is linked to SP Utilities or Ohm. In additional, the issue with SP utilities is that even by using their app to pay with other credit card, 1 credit card can only pay 1 account. For users like me who have to manage my family, my parents and etc. accounts, I am unable to make the payment with the same credit card. However, it is not really Ohm fault.  Hope someone benefit from my honest review here. Thanks   "
5,"Signed up on a 25% discount rate for a 12-mth contract and it was the best decision made!  There are a few positives that I want to highlight: 1. Transitioning from SP to ohm was a breeze. Fuss free and straightforward with still the same SP bill you received, there's no requirement to receive a separate bill and to make separate payment.   2. Customer service was prompt, concise and polite. I remembered raising a question to them at 2am and they responded at 2.30am. ;) They even offered me with a $20 goodwill discount off my bill as I've forgotten to input a referral code to use when I first signed up.   3. Discounted off tariff price plan with OHM is one of the best in the market, coupled with their referral program, they truly made it to enhance consumer stickiness, both my dad and bro have also switched to OHM."
5,"The services and offerings that ohm present to us as consumers was more than just cost savings. Unlike the other electricity retailers who use long term contracts (2-3years) to lock you down with the rates, Ohm is giving me the assurance that if the electricity price gets drive down in the near future, they will be passing down the savings to us. With this assurance, i am more than willing to share the risks with retailer; knowing full well that if the prices increase we will bear it together.   Whats more, they are integrated with SP which makes it all the more easier to make payment into one bill and not having to worry about another late bill. This reduces my hassle by alot and save alot of our mental space.   Customer service was great and replied very promptly. I can see that they are sincere in their replies too and had initiatives to help solve any problems you are facing.   Last but not least my electricity bill fell to all time low ! My sp consumption of 42kwh was $9 but with ohm, my consumption of 224kwh (5 times more) was only $38 (4 times more) !! Amazing but hard to believe i have been paying these prices to SP for so long ! "
5,"I took the leap of faith and signed up for a fix ohm contract the moment my area was eligible to. The 3 month trial period was really useful as ohm decided to further lower the price in the 3rd month and I could cancel and sign up for another new contract with them. Best of all, the customer service was really efficient because i had to contact them due to a mistake in the first billing cycle. And it was resolved within a day. And a plus point is the signing of contract was fuss free and there was no hidden costs. Strongly recommend Ohm!"
5,"I was always skeptical about making the switch but decide to finally go with Ohm as they were able to offer short 6 month contracts with attractive tariff discounts. On top of that they offered a 3 months trial period and most appealing of all, integrated billing with my SP statements which definitely helped me to ease into the switch.  The online sign up process was seamless and very easy and hassle free. When I had questions the customer service on Facebook was very helpful and quick with the response.   It‚Äôs already been 3 months into using Ohm and it has so far been a great experience with nice discounts yet little impact as a result of the switch. No regrets choosing Ohm as my provider and would definitely recommend Ohm to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a reliable fuss free provider."
5,"After comparing all the electricity retailers, I found that Ohm is the best. The rate is cheap, easy to understand, and no hidden charges like some other retailers. You will not be charged for Carbon Tax and TL charges also. I also like that there is integrated bill with SP so there is no additional bill to pay and no additional security deposit to pay. There is also 3 months trial with no termination penalty. Happy saving!"
5,"Prior to choosing ohm, I have compared multiple service provider using the SP app and it appears to me that ohm price plan is the most transparent i.e zero hidden/additional cost. Particularly, there is no additional charge if i choose to opt out of the contract within the first 3 months. Additionally, i understand that I will still continue to use electricity from the national grid (i.e there is no risk of electricity shortage, blackout etc), just at a cheaper rate. So there is no harm in trying..? HAHA. Till date i have opted in for approx 6 months and so far so good :)"
5,"-May not be the cheapest comparatively, but very responsive customer service via Facebook Messenger.  -Very comprehensive FAQ. Little to non strings attached. -Hassle free online electrical supplier switch. -Combined bill with SP is the deciding factor as we dread paying an additional bill  -unlimited referral ($20 per referral) "
5,"Seamless transfer, save bill with refferal credit, prompt and accurate billing, responsive reply to my queries, able to access ebill from SP app and pay bill with the existing credit card arrangement with SP. "
5,"Easy to sign up process. Signed up with them and the process was rather smooth. Not much hiccup on their platform. Received confirmation quite quickly if I can remember. No issue with the billing process. Am the type that will apply, as long as the billing is correct, I don't really look at it. Sent a customer survey about halfway through my 6 months plan and a reminder when it is expiring. So far so good."
5,"Since I applied OHM, my electricity bill is super low and I do not need worry about any hidden charges...  Thank you OHM!! "
5,"Am really glad to sign up with Ohm.  - Same SP bill. There is no need to do anything - I get to try it out for first 3 months so that if anything goes wrong, I can bail out - rebates and discounts has been attractive and competitive - most important is that I get hold of someone when I need help. It doesnt seem like a bigger company can provide a better service anyway."
5,Very happy with the fix rate so far and no issie on the transition period. Well done ohm . Will look forward to consistent supply of affordable energy 
5,"Highly recommended! Fuss free sign up process online. With the promotions, it is definitely one of the Best rates in the market now. What‚Äôs best is the bill from OHM are integrated with SP Services meaning you‚Äôll only have 1 single bill like before üëçüèº"
5,"Have not looked back since switching over to Ohm in November 2018.   What can I say, excellent customer service with prompt replies. They may not have the lowest price on the market but I can say they have one of the best customer service out there.   If you compare among the integrated retailers, Ohm stands out even more.   Their referrals system also rewards new and existing customers in the long run. Win-Win for us all! "
4,"I choose ohm mainly because of their intergrated billing with SP and short term contract. I sign up 1st march 2019 when they had their promotion tier,Intially wanted to sign for their fixed plan but their price increased suddenly on 1st march so in the end i choose Discount off tariff plan for 6 months to look out for any promotion, Hope they will implement attractive promotion when mine contract ends, Would have given 5 stars if they had not made the sudden change on the fixed price plan on 1st march 2019"
4,"Easy to sign up on line, and 3months trial!"
5,"Been using Ohm for 3 months. Not only do I have savings compared to SP, the payment is integrated to SP bills making it so convenient for my family."
5,Fuss free apply and wonderful referral plan. Been using for past 5 months with no issues and haven't even started paying for electricity because the referral credits are not yet used up
5,Good can pay via sp application which save you money and time. One of the better retailer that I research
5,Good can pay via sp application which save you money and time. One of the better retailer that I research
5,Good can pay via sp application which save you money and time. One of the better retailer that I research 
5,Hassle free switch over from SP to Ohm as the billing is still done by SP group! Sign up is fast and easy!
5,"Very good and fuss-free experience! Helped me to save a lot of money.. the tarriffs now has gone up a lot, so my fixed plan signed up back in Jan 2019 is still at a much lower rate of 16.8 cents / kWh. "
5,"So far having been using Ohm for 2 months on a fixed rate 12 month plan. Although slightly more expensive than some competitors, but decided to choose Ohm because of good reviews with after sales service and contactability, which is really important for me and my family. Also great option to have a referral code to get a equal mutual benefit for myself and others. I will need to have a longer relationship with Ohm to have a better idea about them. Watch this space."
5,Very fast and easy setup..just do it online..don need to waste time q up at sp services for 1st timer..thumbs up n gd servicesü§ó
5,"Integrated with SP bill and no deposit required. Aside from the unlimited referral bonus, do note that the rates are no longer the cheapest in the market."
5,"I have stumbled upon ohm energy while sourcing for a energy provider. Signed up for 12 months fixed, bill payment via giro with SP services, didn‚Äôt need to do anything else. Simple and easy. Last month Govt announced the increase in electricity tariffs and it doesn‚Äôt affect me. That‚Äôs the beauty of a fixed plan, you lock the price in and forget about what‚Äôs happening outside until contract is up, then you make another decision. "
5,"If you have not choose to switch to OHM, do so now and you will not regret.. I have already change, what you waiting for. Do it and take action now!!!! "
4,"We switched to Ohm Energy last year, and we have been very impressed with the plan, promo and service they offered. Ohm have the best plan so far until other big name competitors start to provide similar plans with competitive pricing.  But we renew again this year after 6months because of good experiences with Ohm, I even sign up for my parents using Ohm! No complaints! Great pricing! Good service! Keep it up! "
5,A fuss free and seamless conversion process. Glad that i made the decision to switch. The bills look a lot more reasonable! Make the right choice today!
5,"The switching process was easy peasy, filled up the web form within minutes and just await for the confirmation. Billing was straight forward too. No hassles, no strings attached. It is what it is. Thanks Ohm for the smooth service experience thus far!"
5,My electricity bill has never been lower. Now I can use my aircon without guilt. Thank you so much ohm! 
5,"No fuss switch-over, single-bill integration with existing utilities, no change to deposit, and customer-orientedness. Ohm is definitely a good choice to switch over. "
5,"Chose to switch to Ohm because it had the most straight forward, no gimmicks amd fussfree plan. Switching was easy too. Your billing and method of payment via SP would largely remain the same. Definitely the most hassle-free process.   Sadly, I did not receive any additional discounts or promos that they had. With those additions you would probably get an even better deal."
5,"Swapped over immediately when my estate was eligible. No extra, hidden, admin fees, no requirement to install any digital meters and as advertised I'm paying at least 30% less for electricity every month, on top of the initial discounts for months 2 and 3. Only change in my lifestyle was to submit my meter reading every 2 months, an extremely minor (and only) inconvenience if you're not already doing so.  Customer service team was very responsive, and very helpful, when I contacted them with a few questions just before I signed up.  What caught my attention was the modern and intuitive interface of Ohm's website. I've had a couple referrals done and everything is accounted for, almost immediately and with utmost transparency."
4,"Didnt apply from roadshow. Fixed rate, fuss free and no change to SP giro plan.  Can have more perks fr omh :) "
5,Reliable and efficient. Ohm is highly recommended!! I had an extremely pleasant experience so far üòÉüòÉüòÉ

5,Great simple signup to switch over online to ohm. I have done it for 3 household with free 2nd month bill.
5,"Since the switch been done, nothing change except me getting more savings from the discount off the bill! "
5,"Application / sign up is fairly easy and hassle free. Web dashboard is also a good way to track consumption. Very straightforward and best part is joint billing with SP bill, 1 billing by giro for convenience. Didn't encounter any issues since signing up 7mths ago. "
5,"Easy, fast and hassle free application process. One of the lowest rates and single bill consolidation with SP. Highly recommended choice."
5,Great discount! Seamless port over with no disruption! Same SP statement and payment method! Awesome customer service!
5,"I switched to Ohm fix rate 2 year plan since 2019 Q1. The things i like about ohm 1. Bill integrated into SP, so i dont have an additional bill to pay every month; 2. Metres compatible with SP, so there is no change metre fee or whatever; 3. No hidden fees, other than the elec i spend every month; 4. i did not catch any promo, so i got $20 off from a friend's refer only. Bear in mind, there is no cap of this referral bonus.

5,Smooth transition to ohm energy with no disruption to the supply. Helps me to save money too! Good job and keep it up!
5,Managed to save $20 bucks on my first bill with Ohm! Integrated billing with SP means switching was worry free!!! 
4,Am happy to have switched over with just 2 easy steps to do. Sign online and picture for last meter reading.
5,"Subscribed to Simply Ohm when open electricity market is available in my area simply because they are the most affordable. However, being affordable doesn't imply to poor service quality. Transitioning to Ohm has never been so simple! Although they revise the price, they provide a good reason to support it. "
5,"It is a breeze to switch, with lower and discounted rates! I know how much it will be the bill, and need not worry much."
5,"Ohm provide the best competive price in it electricity supply, not only I save money every month with its fixed price I oso save using friend referall. I strongly recommend people who is considering changing electricity supplier to ohm. "
5,Prompt and responsive customer service. Application and installation of the smart meter was done seamlessly. Highly recommended! 
5,"I was planning to go with some other supplier first with slightly higher discount. Then I read reviews about reliability, customer service and ease of switching and Ohm comes out to be best among these parameters. It's been three months now , I can see clear saving and hassle free experience. It's like I never switched but getting lower electricity rates."
5,"Good customer service , helpful , transparent prices.. will recommend to relatives, friends and more people... cheers.."
5,"Simple, intuitive and clean online application process. Seamless transition from SP to OHM without any changes to factors like hardware or bill payments definitely a plus! Recommended to all family and friends!"
5,"Helped my parents signed up Ohm since Jurong was having trial. The service is second to none. Their processing was quite fast, and they replied promptly over facebook messaging. They were also one of the few providers which provided generous sign up goodies. It was so good that I subsequently signed up with there when open electricity came to Hougang. I would certainly recommend anyone who are interested to look for cheaper electricity to considering this vendor."
5,Just did my switch recently to OHM and it is working great for me! The hassle free transition and no additional paper work is great for people like myself. Best part is the monthly savings which I received every month as Compared to before. Definitely no regrets and highly recommended.  Oh did I mentioned that the billing is as per usual as compared to some other operators where you have to download extra apps or login separately for your billing. 
5,Easy sign up and very prompt customer service! 3 month trial period and integrated SP billing. Would definitely recommend :)
5,"After extensive research, I find that Ohm is one of the best alternative electricity suppliers. Choose either Fixed Ohm or Discount Ohm depending on your likings. I chose Discount Ohm as I have a feeling that the tariffs may drop. Fixed Ohm is also very good, and in fact better if tariffs rise.  Read more benefits of Ohm at my blog: https://mathtuition88.com/2018/11/01/ohm-20-promo-code-ohmref25cc5a/"
5,Keep your referral credit rolling and you could save more in electrcity bill. Easy application and great customer service.

5,"Since switching to ohm few months ago, I‚Äôve been saving $20-$30 of my bills. It‚Äôs easy to switch, great customer service, same bill as SP and i‚Äôve referred to few of my friends! Thanks Ohm! üëçüèΩ"
5,Ohm has the best referral system in the market. I have gotten $80 rebate since I sign up 6 months ago. No hassle! 
5,"OHM has one of the best customer service compared to all the other companies they answers questions within minutes, I tried msging all the other companies some don't even reply back let alone solve your problems in mins. Was one of first few to sign up with them during the promo which gives the 2nd and 3rd month 50% off the bill and manage to have saving of a few thousand for the whole year will highly recommend OHM to anyone who wants to have a fuss free experience as the bill is together with the water bill no extra paper bill fee nonsense that other companies have. Been almost 7 months with ohm will highly recommend them no issues or problems with them."
5,"When I first heard about open electricity market, to be honest I was skeptical. I worried about ""blackouts"", ""unreliable electricity supply"", or ""wrong bill"". But Ohm convince me that such worries are unfounded and not true, and I signed up as soon as my area is eligible. I could not be happier with my decision to switch over to Ohm almost 1 year ago. With Ohm I have saved hundreds of dollars. There is flexibility with first 3 months trial with no termination penalty, no hidden 3rd party cost charges, integrated billing with SP thus no additional security deposit needed. Thank you Ohm!"
5,Switching to Ohm is such a fuss-free process and the staffs are prompt in answering my queries! Do switch over to Ohm to enjoy great savings! :)
5,"Ohm was an unknown name to me. Until early this year when I wanted to convert to OEM, several colleagues spoke well of Ohm's uncomplicated Discount Plan. It was a breeze from the beginning - online application, easy to read T&C, very good customer service and integrated / online bill. I've since introduced more friends to Ohm through my referral code.  Most responded with ""Ohm? Never heard of"" but we're now your customers. Arigatou."
5,It was perfect and i will recommend everyone to use it and more saving on bills and cheaper price and more people will find the usage better then other electricity supply
5,"Switching to Ohm was easy and went without a hitch. Prices are among the lowest in the market. Convenient integrated billing through SP Services - absolutely no hassle, just a lower bill every month, everything else stays the same."
5,Had a seamless experience switching to Ohm Energy with a 25% of the regulated tariff plan. The sign-up process was easy and all the information provided was accurate. Even managed to get a $20 discount with a referral code. Their online portal is also easy to use and helpful in tracking my usage. Gonna be getting the rest of family onboard. Great work Ohm Energy Team! 
3,"Signed at a lower fixed rate in Feb. Now their rate has increased, therefore I am unable to refer or recommend my relative and friend to OHM. sad case of changed pricing."
5,Ohm is good. Saves you lots and lots of money. Gives you lots and lots of discounts. Everyone should use Ohm. $$$
5,Switching was super convenient and a no brainer. The rates are competitive and all it needs is to fill up a form. Everything is auto and requires no changes to the original billing arrangements with SP. No extra bills no extra steps and savings are immediate.
5,Simple transition from sp group to ohm energy. The application and implementation is done online and it only take a few days for everything to be approve and complete. Billing is hassle-free as it is well integrated into sp group billing structure. Highly recommended.
5,"Changed to ohm last nov and never looked back since. Competitive pricing plans, hassle free transition, combined SP billing and great customer service pretty much sums up my experience. Have also helped my parents switched to ohm recently.  "
5,"Have been using Ohm energy for several months now. I would say nothing much changed except that my electricity bill came down because of the cheaper tarriffs/kWh! All i had to do was to apply to change to Ohm energy on their website. No additional equipment required, no disruption to supply when switching over, no additional bill as they are tagged to my existing SP bill. The transfer to Ohm energy is seamless! "
5,Easy to communicate with through email or Facebook messenger. Very prompt in replying to all questions asked and have highly recommended them to others! Keep up the great work! 
4,"1. Referral code where both parties get to enjoy $20 off their first bill! Share the joy, enjoy the savings together!   2.Ohm's bill is integrated with your gas and water provider! One bill, less confusion.  3. Be the first few to port over to Ohm and receive additional discount off your bills (depends on promotion)   4. Fuss free when i port over using their online platform. User friendly, straightforward.  5. Zero disruption to our electricity when we port over. Use with ease, but remember to save the earth!   5. Follow their social media pages for the latest news and updates! (Hope to see more promo codes from them to help consumers save more) üòÇ  "
4,"No problem with ohm so far. However, they could have hold some roadshows and promos to get more awareness and customers. "
5,"Best discount over tariff rate in town. Hasslefree sign up, just need to go to www.ohm.sg to sign up. Simple , easy and don't need to arrange for new giro payment as they are billed through SP services. "
5,"After switching to Ohm, been able to have quite a lot of savings. Efficient and reliable company to sign up for. Billing is done with SP Group, saving the hassle for multiple bills. Especially with electricity tariffs going up, it makes even more sense to sign up now."
5,"Was skeptical at first when it comes to choosing a retailer / supplier for my electricity bill. But one thing is for sure, after switching to OHM and signing up with the Discount Plan, I can honestly say I've not regretted it. Fuss free transactions, No disruption to water or electricity during supply date, No hidden cost. And most importantly, I save alot on my electricity bill. Further more, due to promotion, I was able to get a further 25% off my second bill and also use a referral code I got from Seedly.  Cheers!"
4,Changed over at the start of the year. so far so good. used a referral + sign up promo. managed to save a bit. better than no savings!
5,"Just renewed my Ohm subscription. The renewal was easy, and got an additional percentage point of discount off tariff after the renewal. For those who have not sign up, what you waiting for?"
5,"Wow,  overwhelmed by the many choices of electricity suppliers today, especially since there are many roadshows. After comparing the various electricity suppliers, we decided to switch to Ohm.       Reasons      - Cheapest for 12-month discounted rate   - No change fee to opt out of SP and switch to new supplier as Ohm and two other suppliers work with SP group for same billing  - Free to switch plan or terminate plan DURING the first 3 months WITHOUT termination fee - In a way, termination fee is less of our concern - No monthly service fee (iSwitch does ask for $4+ per month) - No transmission loss factor fee  - No security deposit  (because you already did so with SP Power and Ohm is partnering with SP for same billing)  The only disadvantage we can think of is that it doesn't have bank promotion of $50 one time rebate (mostly $50, a few are $60 but could be $10 rebate for every month) that most other suppliers offer and one even offer more than $100 rebate for 3-year plan.  Cheers!"
5,Great promotions and they have superb customer service via their fb messaging. Very responsive even after office hours!
4,Have taken up a plan with them since march this year. The experience has been fast free. Maintain same sp bill.
5,Fuss free application. Their customer service response is very efficient via Facebook messenger and email. They have rendered the appropriate help to resolve my issues. 
5,"After carefully comparing different providers, I chose OHM because it was fuss free sign up, no deposit required, and had competitive prices. Also, the 3-month trial period with free switching was very helpful to reassure me that OHM is a reliable provider."
5,"Good Experience with Ohm Energy so far.  Have some queries and able to contact the customer service.  Hassle free switch, integrated billing, best discount rates at the moment.  So far so good!"
5,"Here's why I will recommend OHM:  - Fuss-free sign-up, the only document required is your NRIC copy - User-friendly website  - Competitive rates, they even absorb the transmission loss  - Smooth transition - On-line portal available for tracking  - Bill integration with existing SP group's!  - Free cancellation within 3 months for new users  Thank you for reading and good luck! :)"
5,"After a lot of reviewing, I decided to switch to Ohm.   Reasons - Cheapest for 12-month discounted rate - Billing integrated with SP - See your electricity bill on SP utilities - Flexible plans - No security deposit  - Price comparison option on website helps make better decision - https://ohm.sg/price-plan-calculator - Easy signup process - took me less than 5 minutes"
5,Fuss free sign-up and integrated with existing SP bill. Friendly customer service and no hidden cost. Highly recommended. Sign up now and enjoy great savings! 
5,"Electricity is all the same, regardless of the suppliers. if there is any changes, we cannot tell until then.   Use Ohm because it is the cheapest for the flexible plan. Since you are checking this, you will know already.  Have fun."
5,"I chose Ohm Energy Fixed 24 months. Ohm is the go to Electricity Retailer. The rate is great, easy to understand and no hidden charges. Integrated billing with your existing SP Services."
5,"After researching for a while, I chose OHM. Excellent customer service. Very swift and professional in responding to my inquiries. It has the best fixed plan for 6 months term. Plus, their billing is integrated with the current one from SP. Hassle free.  "
5,"I signed up with OHM as the plans are straight forward,understandable,hassle-free with no hidden charges.Had a few queries prior to signing up and it was all explained in fathomable fashion by the Customer Service Agent.There's no TLF charges,security deposit(as it's tied to the existing SP deposit fee),registration fee,carbon tax(which will be implemented in 2019) and it's consolidated in a single SP bill.  Cheers... "
5,"On 1st Nov 2018, I signed up 24M fixed plan with OHM after compared all the electricity providers saving plans. Basically all electricity providers offer about the same savings due fierce initial competition. Players receive with strong sign up will stay in this open energy market & weak ones will go eventually.  Hyflux is out this round.   If you are hesitating , just look for long term good services which I believe OHM can provide judging from the its effort to tie up with SP service on bill payment. That means you stick to your SP Services bill statement. All in 1 monthly bill."
5,Hassle-free sign up. Easy to understand tariff option and best is the single bill from SP.  i have opted for the 12-month discount rate option.
5,I have chosen the 24 months fixed plan at 18.14 cents/kWh since oil price will remain high going forward. Have to submit scanned copy of NRIC.  Take note that Discount off regulated tariff includes third party charges which is around 7%.  Good luck and happy shopping ! 
5,Billing through SP in 1 consolidated bill. Hassle-free sign up in just 5 minutes through their website. Conversion in just 1 week. Provide correct details to avoid unnecessary conversion charges. Limited marketing. Plans and rates are 1 of most market competitive. Currently the only player offering fixed rate (currently at 17.92 cents) price plan with no contract at $10.70 monthly subscription which is great for heavy energy users. Recommended. 
5,"I Signed up on a fixed rate for a 12-mth contract and all is good!  Sign up process is less than 5 mins, fast and smooth!!  Transiting from SP to ohm was a breeze and straightforward, customer service was on point and there is no issues with the electricity supply during the transition and moving forward. :)"
5,"With Ohm electricity , everything is the same as SP Power with the benefit of good monthly savings on your electricity bills every month. Further, no additional deposit or need to redo your GIRO. You even receive one same single billing from SP Power as before.  Sign up asap and start savings :)"
5,"The best thing about Ohm electricity is that, to me, everything is the same as SP Power except for cheaper bill. You would not need to redo your GIRO and no extra deposit.  To apply:  https://ohm.sg/index All the information you need for the registration can be obtained from your old SP bills. You will need to upload your front and back picture for your IC (or equivalent).    I have applied for Fixed Ohm for 24 mths (longest) as the oil price now (end Nov 2018) is lowest for the past 52wks."
4,"Sign up was easy and still use SP Billing. I signed up the ""Ohm Discount""  which has 25% discount off SP tariff. 25% for 12months contract.  "
5,"Sign up was really easy, link to SP Group Billing gives a lot more confidence and the rate is the best you can get for both fixed and variable rates amongst all the retailers. That plus no hidden fees. Recommended! Only downside is that there‚Äôs a higher cancellation fee but if you‚Äôre not planning to cancel this shouldn‚Äôt be a factor. The potential savings from $20 per person that you refer can add up to a lot. Have already saved at least one month‚Äôs electricity bill because of referrals. So get in early so you can refer to all your friends before they switch and it‚Äôll amount to more savings compared to other providers without this referral deal!"
5,1) Cheapest Discount Off Tariff Plan with only 6 months contract 2) No need to set-up new Giro for billing (billing is still done with SP 3) Services 4) No hidden fees 5) Easy sign up online
5,"Plus points about this retailer: 1) competitive pricing 2) good customer service 3) very easy to sign up 4) indirect billing through SP, so no hassle of having 2 utility bills"
5,Easy and seamless sign up process. Customer service is top notch. Responded to my queries on messenger promptly at 1am in the morning. A pleasant surprise. Signed up for 6 months Ohm Discount as it is the most value for money plan currently. Hoping that I am the 1st 300 new sign ups to obain the promotion for 50% off 2nd and 3rd bill for new sign ups.
4,"I did a detail reviewed of all the plan with market research.   Results is : 1. All retailers offer similar price.  2. As price only increase not decrease over time (based on last 3 years SP rate), out of the 3 types of plan, get fix rate plan 2 or 3 years to lock in the rate to be safe in case when future price increase still enjoy best rate. 3. Seedly user review here shows OHM and Geneco has the best offer and transparent pricing. No hidden charges. The only difference is OHM take our deposit from SP, same bill in SP while OHM doesn't take any deposit.  4. Only bad points is OHM offer / deals rather flat and don't really do much road show.  5. To sigh up, get ready image of IC front and back , SP account number, SP bill (if service address different from NRIC)   Point 2 further Analysis: a) Floating rates  -  not worth it because there's a chance of price increase If don't lock in the rate.  b) Off peak rate - need to pay for smart meter. Cost too high, not justifying the cost. "
5,"Sign up was really easy and convenient. OHM still use SP Billing. Low cost and simplicity in plans, Meters are not required to be replaced"
5,"3-months free trial, Fuss free sign-up & integrated with existing sp bill. I have surveyed and compared all retailers, I believe Ohm is the best choice. Especially you can keep everything same as you used SP group before except cheaper electricity fee."
5,"3 months trial, can cancel anytime with no penalty, integrated with SP bill, no hidden charges, great saver plan, highly recommended."
5,Bill is incorporated into SP Services bill but you won't be able to see the electricity portion. You need to login to your Ohm account to view your usage and bill.   Super convenient!
5,Researched about the various providers before settling on Ohm as it was affordable and has pretty good reviews. Sign up took 5mins.
5,"Easy sign-up. No-brainer to get 25% off SP tariff every month. May not be the lowest all the time, but it's fuss-free."
5,Hassle-free sign ups! Did not expect it to be so easy. Did a few comparisons and found this to be more suitable for me. Definitely happy having able to save some extra bucks every month!
5,"I have selected Ohm because: 1. The electricity market has just opened and I need a more flexible plan so I can respond to the market in case of any significant changes. Ohm offers 3 month trial with no penalty. And the term of its best discount plan is also as short as 6 months. It suits my purpose. 2. I don't need to change my existing billing process with SP Group. So I don't have to worry about the billing service and continue to use my existing GIRO. Also, no security deposit is required when I switch from SP Group to Ohm. 3. The response from Ohm customer service is quick and friendly."
5,"Best for fuss-free sign up integrated with existing SP Bill and no deposit required!! Not the cheapest in the market currently, but reviews said their customer service is better."
5,Fuss free sign-up and integrated with existing SP bill. Friendly customer service & no hidden cost. Recommended!
5,Been using Ohm since Jan 2019. So far so good. Been enjoying its lower rates and same billing on SP Group which makes it easier for me to track/make payments.   To be honest I felt that this is one of the best electricity retailers as everything felt the same before and after the switch (other than the huge saving in the cheaper rates).
5,Hi all We switched to ohm as it is very easy and seamless. Same integrated bill as sp group as well. Good reviews and customer service. Supply start date informed immediately after sign up.
5,Fuss free sign-up and integrated with existing SP bill. Friendly customer service & no hidden cost. Recommended!
4,Super easy sign-up online. The switch was done within 2 hours after I applied online. All things considered the cheapest for fixed-discount over 12 months. No extra security deposit needed and monthly fee.
5,Fuss free sign-up and integrated with existing SP bill. Friendly customer service & no hidden cost  
5,"Read up quite a bit on all the companies and reviews before I decided on Ohm 25% discount off tariff. 1. Integrated SP bill  2. Standard plan - no hidden cost/charges during the course of your contract unlike a few other companies which either had monthly charges or their contract turned out to be a non standard plan (they can make changes to the contract, pricing during the course of our contract) despite it being sold as a fixed price plan  3. Free termination within the first 3 months if you change your mind  4. Abovementioned May promotion makes the deal even sweeter!"
5,Excellent customer service and fast process  It might not be the cheapest in the market but the easiest and most reliable one Thank you üòä

5,"Intensive reviews can be found here, lots of talks about Ohm. https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/open-electricity-market-oem-5795522.html"
5,"Hi,   I have changed to Ohm in November. It's very good, esp one bill with SP! recently it sent me email and I can change plan to lower price at no cost. I have also earned money by referring.   Wishing you huge blessing in the Year of the Pig! Best wishes for all friends!"
5,"The biggest single draw for me was the ONE single bill from SP Group even after having switched over to Ohm Energy, unlike other players.  Ohm also keeps marketing overheads low by relying on word-of-mouth.  They absorbed the pesky transmission loss factor(TLF) of ~3.4%, so comparing to other retailers who quote rates without adding the TLF, Ohm Energy is still the cheapest. hey, this is a commodity so there is no need to go for 'branded' electricity supply. Customer Service is provided in partnership with SP Group, so no issues."
5,It was fuss free signing up with Ohm and with billing and payment stay the same. It makes things much easier.
5,"Just signed up.. Was quite easy to do it.. As some of the other have pointed out, it's not the cheapest plan out there but 25% off regulated price plus no security deposit and got a 20$ rebate using a referral..   their website also looks clean and easy to use..  they give you an option to cancel within first 3 months without any termination fee, which is also good to know.."
5,"I called customer service and was given very honest and upfront information about ohm. Without hesitation, I signed up and used a referral code which enabled me $20 off! I am now enjoying the 25% discount off SP tariff and I think it is great!"
5,"I am happy with my 24-month contract with Ohm (www.ohm.sg) because of its competitive rate (17.98 cents/kWh), integrated billing with SP services, 3-mth trial and no deposit required. "
5,So far no complaints for Ohm. Waiting for my next bill to see what will be the actual charges be like. Just switch soon it will be better for all. 
5,Simply and fuss free. Free to switch to better plan within 3 months.  ùêéùêáùêåùêëùêÑùêÖùüîùüèùüëùüñùüèùüé  $20 here you go

5,"Just did online sign up and process completed within 15 mins. Pricing and details are transparent with no hidden charges. I signed up for 25% discount off tariff, with a short 6 months contract. (most other vendors requires at least 12 months typically)."
4,"fuss free sign-up & integrated with existing sp bill. attractive rates, 3-month free trial, no hidden cost"
5,For me it is the best so far. Has been using it for 3 months and no issue at all. Customer service is great. Questions got replied within a day. 
5,"Fyi, I chose ohm DOT (Discount off tariff) as ohm provides the best rate of 25% lower than the government electricity price (i.e. SP group) for 12 months contract. This is a win win package if compared to fixed rates if you are not a ""gamble"" because hard to know the electricity tariff will go up or down. Just my personal advise. =) Thank you!"
5,"Cheapest discount rates among all the providers, they handled all the admin works with SP group, easy to sign up (note: Safari browser won't work for their sign up form). "
4,Very user friendly so far. No additional deposit and the bill comes in the same bill as SP Services.
5,"I chose Ohm because: - Billing with SP Services - Deposit taken care of between SP Services and Ohm, no need to add more cash - Cheap rate under fixed contract (safe), no surprises, no hidden cost - 3 months without lock in or at least any penalty fee for switching if needed - Super easy, fast and fuss free switch and onboarding online Peace out! :)"
5,"Easy process of signing up and in the discount category it has the best offer. Thanks to Seedly, it was easy to decide the company for the switch. I was bit disappointed initially by not seeing them in roadshow but now it makes sense because online registration is very smooth. "
5,Easy to navigate website. Best discount for DOT plan in the market! Same bill as SP & no further deposit needed! Confirmation email received 10 mins after sign-up! Superfast & efficient customer service! Do not miss out this promo! Sign up with Ohm right now!

5,Easy switch - Integrated billing with SP and 25% discount off regulated tariff.
5,"After deliberating since last Nov, today I signed up becoz of their reviews & promotion. So pls sign up NOW as OHM‚Äôs prices & customer services are great! Why OHM? I‚Äôm sure you hv read so many reviews. Well, main reasons are that it‚Äôs fuss free, same SP Bill & customer services, no security deposit, no TLF & carbon tax, no relocation charges in case u move house (within opened zones), fantastic customer svcs etc. What else? I had called their customer svcs a few times for the past few wks to make enquiries & they are friendly in answering all my queries. Today I called them again after signing up, as I had put the wrong start date. As it‚Äôs after 6pm, I emailed them and was surprised to receive their email reply almost immediately on how to rectify my issues. Then I emailed them again to clarify further and was surprised to receive a call from them. So I was impressed that they took the trouble to call me not once but 2 times despite their customer svc hours being over. That‚Äôs really exceptional 5 Stars üëç service from their OHM staff named ‚ÄúDean‚Äù. FYI I chose the fixed plan contract for 12 mths as it works out cheaper than the 25% discount rates. So don‚Äôt procrastinate anymore and sign up Now! Thank u for reading my long but honest reviews. May God bless u! üòä"
5,Good customer service and responses. Hassle-free sign up and don't have to bother with separate invoice billing. 
5,"Just switched to ohm. chose ohm because there is totally no hidden charges, security deposits and separate bill. "
5,"I have signed up the 25% discount off sp tariff rate. Worth to switch to ohm no deposit, no hidden cost..."
5,I switched to ohm better than i do nothing and stay with sp!
4,Was a quick and hassle-free switch! I picked the 12 month fixed rate plan! 
5,"Choose ohm because: 1. Easy to apply. 2. No hidden cost. 3. Still using the same bill from SP 4. Giro no change 5. Security deposit also from existing SP bill On Fixed Ohm, 12 month contract @ $18.03 "
5,"Have switched since Dec last year, got the fixed price 12 months plan and no complaints so far. Also did a bit of research in the past so let me quickly share my logic for those interested: Only 3 factors to consider, since electricity is still centrally supplied and the infrastructure doesn‚Äôt change. 1. Price - you‚Äôll want to consider i) fixed vs. variable price, ii) your contract duration and iii) other promos available 2. Service - minor point, esp. for suppliers like ohm when you can bill through SP services anyway; but in general ohm has been responsive, UX is pretty good 3. Environmental impact - if you care about this (but I suspect few of us do); sunseap is the only provider with solar energy plans Other notes on prices: - If you believe the market is cyclical, (and given 95% of SG‚Äôs electricity is natural gas, prices correlate with tariffs), both prices are currently above mean; in that case you‚Äôd prefer variable prices; BUT last I checked, most fixed plans have a steeper discount than variable plans currently - Companies like ohm have a renewal discount, so you‚Äôll want to consider this too - Most providers also have referral codes or other fancy acquisition promotions to lure you in, which you can consider "
5,"Good customer service,easy online sign up and intergrated bill with SP services. "
5,"Attractive rates (17.98 cents/kWh), 3-month free trial, no hidden costs, easy sign-up."
5,Just received my first bill which comes in the same bill under SP services. ONE bill all 3 utilities services makes it extremely convenient!

5,Fuss free sign up & most attractive discounted rate at 25% off SP Tariff ! No reason not to sign up! 
5,"3 month free trial, billed together with other utilities via SP (no additional letter), great customer service"
4,"Sign up was really easy and convenient, almost all the t&cs were written clearly and simple (although if you click on the factsheet it's only for 6 months instead of 24 months which the rate is different). Customer portal was easy to access and navigate, so kudos to that as well. All in all looking forward to see how much I can save!"
5,"No TFL, carbon tax. All absorbed! You pay the rate you see! Partners with SP-hassle free transfer. "
5,"Why Ohm: Attractive rates, no hidden fees, billing via SP, easy sign-up, 3-month free trial, great customer service. "
5,"Awesome discount off rates as well as fixed rates. The bill comes on the same piece of paper as other utility bills from SP group, hence there is no need to make separate payments. There are also no hidden costs! The website estimates the amount of electricity a house uses and gives a rough gauge of savings incurred. "
5,"Process to sign up was easy, billing together with SP = one bill. "

5,Sign up was fuss free. Have a fantastic 2019 ahead!
5,That was such an easy transition! Totally makes sense and I'm glad I made the switch to Ohm.
5,"After comparing a few suppliers, I've decided to sign up for Ohm considering it's hassle-free and quite attractive in pricing"
5,"I was a little behind on the uptake about the open market and was rather clueless about the various providers. Since the main objective of switching was to save $$, I wanted the cheapest option or rather the most value-for-money (typical Singaporean, no good = no use). Upon online research, Ohm Energy and Keppel Electric caught my attention as they offer the most competitive prices (17.98 cents/kWh fixed rate for 24 months). You can do a quick search here to have an overview of the prices in the market: https://compare.openelectricitymarket.sg/#/home (A few players seemed to have revised their rates, offering lower rates than the 2 aforementioned players, but I did not regret my decision about Ohm mainly because of the following reasons). #1. Easy and hassle-free sign-up (Just requires your particulars and they will handle the transfer process) #2. Same monthly bill (Old habits die hard and adapting to change is rather cumbersome) #3. Free 3-month trial (If their service is not satisfactory, we can just change to another provider without any termination fees) I hope this review will be useful for people who are also clueless about the open market."
5,Had change to Fixed Ohm one month ago. Easy and hassle free sign up on their website. Plus now they are lowering the cost which is a win win for all. 
5,Did not regret in signing up Ohm electricity. Save me more than $150 per year!
5,Fuss free sign-up and integrated with existing SP bill. Go with the fixed tariff rate of 1 year and get savings more than 28%. Search for historical electricity tariff by SP and you know going for fixed tariff will reap you more savings. 
5,Fuss free sign-up and integrated with existing SP bill. 
5,My monthly savings is now more than $30 per month . The power supply is still with SP and so you would not notice any change . I had hesitation before switching . But customer service was excellent and answered all my questions patiently 
5,"Competitive rate.....most importantly gd customer service...just signed up with OHM after 3 continuous calls to the customer service...handle cases very nicely, skillfully with patient. "
5,Just switched over. I suppose this is one of the best provider.

5,"Thus far, when you sign up you will get a discounted rate upon inputting the code. Also the website is so user friendly! and 3 months of free termination if you want to cancel. Moreover, the bill will be incorporated in SP Power bill! Definitely for older generations and those who want to help reduce the annoying different letters sent. "
5,Simple sign-up and fuss free billing when you sign up with OHM. 
5,"I have just signed up (switching from SP). The process was straightforward and took around 5 to 10 mins. I received my email confirmation and online account activation within an hour while my electricity provider is expected to change (without additional action from my end) from SP to Ohm next week. Plus, billing still remains to be done through SP, so it really is fuss-free. It's just like getting electricity from SP, but 25% cheaper. Based on my research, their Ohm Discount plan is a very good discount rate that ensures you'll always pay 25% cheaper than the prevailing SP Group tariff. I found these resources very helpful: - Open Electricity Market Price Comparison: https://compare.openelectricitymarket.sg - Seedly Blog: https://blog.seedly.sg/electricity-retailer-comparison-cheapest-in-singapore/ "

5,"If you are switching to another electricity retailer in the current Open Electricity Market, the best retailer is Ohm after I had conducted a thorough analysis. It is using SP power grid with no disruption and has 25% discount off SP's regulated tariff. It has a 3-months trial too. Its bill is integrated with SP bill too. No security deposit needed. Special meter installation is not required. It has the most positive reviews online. Moreover, its customer service reviews are very high. Very smooth transition as they are partners with SP group. For instance, there is no need for any paperwork nor additional payment of deposit."
5,After viewing all those retailers and feel that Ohm has the best deal and promotion. Just switched to the 12 month fixed price and look forward to the new discounted monthly fee. Happy New Year!
4,Just signed up.. looking forward to savings. 
5,Ohm is the best choice among 14 retailers. Free trial 3 months without termination fee apply.

4,"Application was quite smooth, card delivery was punctual as well. Network, however, is not stable, especially underground while in the train."
3,"first and foremost, you gonna be fair, looking at the 1gb to unlimited plan, this has got to be the most value for money telcos you can ever find in SG at the moment.  alright lets jump into the sign up process from my personal experience. As many may or may not be aware of it, Zero1 is a virtual telco company, unlike the ""big brothers"" in the market, (Singtel / Starhub / M1) it does not have a physical identity nor presense, all communication is solely available online (facebook / email / zero1 website).  signing up was straightforward, via the online, sign up an account, sending in information of NRIC(like all other mobile lines sign up since even prepaid cards require this sort of information), payment via credit/debit cards  i got mine applied in the typical Wednesday afternoon, and in 2 days time, it was due for item delivery, via xDel (alternatively you may arrange with xDel for selfcollection, location is between redhill and tiong bahru).  initially had the delivery to my house, but i was excited and decided to pop by for self collection instead.  got my item first thing in the early mornings. but card wasnt activated, so i emailed zero1 and got update that it will be ""automatically activated"" in 1 day time.  but unfortunately, it did not, obviously the person who attended to me via the fb wasnt very knowledgable in his stuff, however i was rather ""kaisu"" so i had another emailed sent and was replied, it will be activated in 1 business day, still being hopeful it will get activated, but i waited whole weekend with no news.   On Monday itself, morning felt miserable, as it is the 4th day since i got my sim card without any usage. decided to give them another nudge hoping for some quick activation, but was only replied with a note, please login zero1 to check on the status.  in the afternoon, suddenly i notice my reception got zero to none, but it did receive the telco as zero1, starting to get a glimpse of hope there. in matter of hours, around late evenings, when i checked the phone again, it finally got activated.  first day using, it was definitely amazing, did a check of speed connection via speedtest by Ookla, the speed was so much compariable to my current telco ""Orange"", did a second  seperate plan comparison on telco ""Red"", and found out that zero1 out beats the speed by 4 times. (telco ""Red"" wasnt on throttling plan fyi)  fastforward, since my plan was on the 9.90 (promo pack for 6months, after that is 13.90) 1gb was used up in 1day time. throttling kicks in, as many reviews and from zero1 states that, speed will stay comparably stable at whatsapp / youtube / facebook / twitter / netflix. well i have to say it is kinda true. at 480p on youtube it runs smooth.   been using it for almost a week till date, i can only comment, it may not be the best of the best, but for the price you paid, and at this rate, in simple math (13.90sgd / 30days ) = $0.46 per day.  i guess it wouldnt kill to pay for 50cents a day for unlimited data. but for gamers (etc. mobile legends or maplestory) i wouldnt recommend, as this data is not made for 2 ways data (download and upload) but mostly downloads, and only limited to certain applications.  alright sorry for the lengthy post, lets summaries in sweet general points and recommendation  (1) sign up on Monday only so you will get your card by Wednesday and since activation take 1 business day, you should be able to get it up by Thursday, give Friday a buffer if shit happens.  (2) op for self collect if you are concern about the delivery schedule screwing up, you can collect early in the morning too.  (3) do not expect wonderful connection on every website or downloads of images and stuff. as mentioned, it is limited to whatsapp / youtube(480p) / facebook / twitter / netflix(480p)  (4) facebook replies is dependent on their mood, email replies typically gets back to you at 9pm to 11pm (maybe they operates on different timezone, god knows), didnt even manage to get any phone support  (5) there is no zeroApp, many has been asking. sms update is only available to remind you have have finish the 1/3gb and throttling will begin.  (6) potentially, you are paying 50cents per day for unlimited network if you signed up the 13.90sgd plan like myself.  thats all folks, i hope i have answered the doubts an question of all interested but skeptical about the cheap plan service. (:  Cheerss~~  Note: 1 note to iPhone users. Global sms will be sent via your zero1 number if your were to have activation request sent. I was charged 1x global sms of $0.60 because of that. In case you are wondering why zero1 charges you on that. I was lucky enough to get replies from their slow respond team.   Note on the different emails from enquire.  Yes@zero1.sg is for enquires Billing@zero1.sg is for billing related. Orderprocessing@zero1.sg is for billing invoice PDF.   "
1,"zero1 is another VMNO (rent network / hardware from Singtel), so will inherit characteristics of Singtel network if any good or bad.   Pros: 1. Price - Got the zero1 at promo price of $19/month for early adopters.   After exceeding the zero1 first 3GB data package @ 4G LTE speed,  subsequent data speed varies, since now it only shows 3G, it might be 3G or even slower.   Cons: 1) FB, IG, Tik Tok or download apps => Slow but bearable, have to wait lor.. no choice.  2) Unlimited data - But subject to reasonable use. It has a fine print T&C hidden in their website bottom shows that if you tether or use unreasonable amount of data, they reserve the rights to charge you and terminate your plan.  3) Customer Service: Takes 1 to 2 months to respond. So be prepared.  4) No self service mobile apps - With CSO takes 1 to 2 months to respond, you're basically left with just suck thumb and use it and if no good use your other main line or other telco.  "
3,"looks slow processing as i tried to port over but only receive 2 sms from the,not sure when my port in will come ,hope it gets better overtime."
4,"Honestly, if not for Erika from the order processing team, I would have given 2 Stars. Zero1, please give her a pay increment.  The application was seamless. No issue on that at all.  However, when it comes to the delivery, there was no confirmation until I email the order processing team. It was then the 'star of the show', Erika arrives.  She would reply to all my email efficiently and kept me in the full loop of things.  Same goes for the porting. A lot of hiccups but it was her again to resolve the issue efficiently.  In short, if you want to choose Zero1, you have to deal quite extensively with the order processing team or else you would have a lot of uncertainties.   It is a value proposition which you had to accept. Cos I choose the $9.90 plans (twice), I sort of expected this. But if you are choosing the higher plans, then my advice is to stick with the main telcos cos the price difference is not much and you have seamless transistion without any hassle of having to communicate with the order processing team (I used GOMO prior to this and it was a great experience)."
2,"Service is bad, no proper customer service to support issue. Line broke down two times for half day, internet connection is superslow, like dial up net. not worth to save the penny for such horrific life "
1,I received sim card last week. It is still not activated. The customer service is as good as nothing. Calling no operator to pick up the call. Emaill also never reply.
1,Signed up and waited a day which del failed. Informed i need to pay 2nd trip delivery as it is my fault nobody open the door; no one knocks at all. Feels bullied and cheated. Customer service use T&amp;C to protect the company and penalize the customer with extra charges. I will never come back to this telco again.
4,"Good value for the price.  I am on $9.9/month for 1GB and unlimited data for 6 months, then I will have to pay $15/month.   The speed is really slow. However, it is just good enough to play audio. So you can listen to Spotify without any issues. You can browse Facebook, Instagram can be an issue if you scroll too fast, but usable. Reddit is excellent. The issue is you can't watch videos. If you want to play smooth video in YouTube you need to watch at 240p, even 360p will play but you will see some buffering and 480p and up will make it practically unplayable.  Why am I still giving 4 starts? Because before this I had 5GB of data and rarely used YouTube or Spotify on the go. But now, even though it is slow I at least have the option to use these apps. I can watch unlimited YouTube videos and 240p works for me because most of the time I am watching news where the quality of the video doesn't matter. Of course, you can't watch Netflix smoothly.   If you get the $30/month plan you can get better speeds."
1,"i have subscript for zero1 1gb plan for data purpose on 23 Sept 2018, but yet till now it still cannot be used. despite 3 emails sending to ZERO1 yet till now after 2 weeks no one called or reply a usable solution to me. SUPER DISAPPOINTED WITH THE NEW TELCOM. WILL NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO USE THEM AGAIN!   (asking for refund and termination of the contract after this month; do not know how long will they need to reply to me)"
3,I decided to cancel my multi-Sim and get the Zero1 during the initial launch   Pros  1) network is good as it rides on SINGTEL  2) no frails  3) unlimited data  Cons 1) no app to manage plan/check usage  2) no perks such as contest/ loyalty 3) unlimited data after 3 GB is meh ...   Summary get this plan if you are not a high consumer of data.
5,"Just received my Zero1 SIM card a week ago.  Free wavier of call ID,  registration,  new SIM card and caller ID.  Plan consists of: 200 mins talk, 200 SMS, First 3GB at full network speed. Unlimited data at managed speeds.  Yet to exceed 3GB,  so unable to comment further.   Experience thus far as follows:  1. Short notice for delivery, only  inform one day before actual day of delivery, with option to  reschedule.   2. A bit late - quoted deliver between 0900 - 1300 hours.   Reached around 1320 hours.    They do call prior to the time to inform.   May be due to ‚òî day,  thus forgiven.   Safety more important. üòÅ  3.  First few hours the SMS was not wrongly properly.   It is fine there after.  4.  Great voice quality.   5.  Data so far so good.   Notice a slight delay is sending whatsapp messages.  Approximately 5 - 10 seconds.  So no big deal.   I like it very much at this moment. Value for üí∞ too,   only $19.90  Will definitely cancel my STel upon maturity of contract and if zero1 continues to serve me well.  Currently pay $60 per month for STEL.  Yearly cost: zero1 = $240                       STEL = $720 Savings = $480 (can go JB , Batam,  pints) üòÅüòÅüòÅ"
4,I have subscribed Zero1 from Fen 2019 when Zero 1 launch the $19 unlimited plan. The line is very stable and most of the website and App can use without any disruption. Even though the speed is 4G data line only limited to 3GB but it is more than enough for me but the unlimited 3G data even though is not really fast but still acceptable when using some chatting and online app except watching Youtube or video online. Overall I still very satisfied with the performance 
4,"On the $19 early bird/loyalty package. 200 mins call is more than enough for me. However, as I have been using TPG's data, I am tempted to cancel this line as customer service is very poor!"
4,"For the start I get to know Zero1 is frankly their pricing which go as low as $9.90/mth for the first 6 months and subsequent will be $13.90/mth. From pricing perspective this is unbeatable compare with other telco from my point of view.   From the speed perspective it will have some trade off as it runs at 4G speed for first 1GB subsequent will be at manage speed (which I really do not know at what speed) bear in mind $9.90/mth and $13.90 thereafter what can we ask for right?  From my personal experience I have no issue at all and it is doing fine (able for all social media) although may experience start and stop of data but rest assure very minimum which can be negligible but for me is fine. It fits me perfectly because I have low usage of mobile data that is why I have nothing but praise for Zero1 so far.  Closing thoughts, Zero1 is nothing but the top choice for user with low usage of data who is looking at purely simple social media usage.  Hope my personal experience helps, Cheers."
1,"This Telco only good thing is cheap plan with unlimited throttle internet. But if you need any help, there is no hotline to call which means 0 customer service and can only email which take 1 day to response. So imagine you reply the email, you need another day m so on. Use at your own risk"
1,Zero1 has bad connection. It was down a few times and i had to get pre paid card for data as i needed my hp for work. Customer service very slow for reply on email. Only thru email u can get customer service. I wont recommend it to anyone. Ive used it for 4 mths. There are now better telco brands and plans out there for no contract plans. They took very long to cancel my line. 
1,Very bad billing process. Was over billed though I have already cancelled the line and it took months for them to investigate and refund me. 
1,"Applied online and payment made. however, did not receive any updates or news from the provider despite follow-up emails. "
4,"In contrary to most of the negative review here, my experience with Zero1 is way more acceptable, partly due to the price that I am paying and also the low expectation arises from the negative reviews here.  I do wish to share my experience here, for some of the people who are still keen to try out their competitive plans.  I signed up for port in on the 30 Nov 2018. Receive my delivery confirmation on the 2 Dec 2018 and the earliest delivery time available is on the 6 Dec 2018, but you can only select the time slot from 9am to 6pm, which mean you have to standby for the whole day (Please do take note of that). Alternatively, you may opt for self collection like some other did.   And true enough, I received my sim card on the 6 Dec 2018, 11am. I did use the tracker but it wasn't a real time update. So I was not sure when exactly will it be delivered and I didn't receive any call to confirm if I am available for collection. However, since I will be in the office anyway, it didn't bother me much.  On the 6 Dec 2018, at around 10.44am, I received a sms from Zero1 stating that porting of my existing number is approved. (There were a few more sms before, informing me that the porting process had been initiated etc.). At around 11pm, I lost all my network connectivity from M1 (my previous service provider).   I didn't check constantly, but at 2am, I manage to get some signal from Zero1 sim card, but availability of data, sms and call were only available in stages. I have my data connectivity at 2.15am, and only have my sms and call availability in the morning around 7am.   And so, the porting process was a success and I am grateful that the process is not as bad as some other unfortunates.   Now, for speed test, around commonwealth area, I am getting peak speed of 100Mbps (Mega Bits Per Second) for download, and 80Mbps for upload. The speed will fluctuate but it hover around 70Mbps for download and upload.   After the 1gb data, I am consistently getting 0.7MBps to 1Mbps speed. And truth to be told, streaming youtube at 480p seems fine for me so far.  Customer service wise, like what the other mentioned, you can't expect immediate response (through email or facebook) and there is no hotline so far.   So, in conclusion, if you are someone that can take this kind of uncertainty or you are just looking for a plan for your secondary devices, I think this is a good plan to have."
1,"If have zero rated star I would put as zero star.   First of all I am the first batch that received the $19 package which is you only pay $19 per month this includes free caller ID with 3gb data, 200mins outgoing, free incoming calls and gst inclusive.  Which sounds pretty good am i right?  The delivery time limited to two, one morning and one evening. After evening time there will be additional charges. The worst of all you cannot put your own delivery timing. You must suit their delivering timing to yours.  The monthly bill they will debit via your debit card every month. Which I do not know the statements bills do exist or not. Because I put off the idea of having Zero1 as my operator.  Lastly when I want to request for help, I emailed them and they get months to reply. Damn pissed off when you needed help and they are not there for you. Basically one word for their customers service. Sucks. It just like they sell you the line and went MIA.   So recently I have just change from Singtel to m1. Sim only contract plan. 1 year contract.  $20 everymonth. 5gb data and 100mins outgoing and free incoming calls. With corporate plan.  The total data will be 7Gb and 100mins outgoing and free incoming with free caller ID for the entire year as per contract.  So currently I'm happy using this."
1,"I had received the new SIM card and didn't know the default password to change the number. Tried calling the office but only get message that it is close even though I called during office hour. There is no customer service to answer your queries except through a damned answering machine. This new telco is just like a phantom company,just collect subscriptions and later neglected the subscribers Though data plan is cheaper than other telcos, it cannot compensate for the poor customer service. I had regretted greatly to port over such lousy Telco. "
4,I‚Äôve been using this mobile plan and saved quite a bit since I hopped on! Was originally paying $30 for m1 but the initial fees for zero1 is only $10. The unlimited data at regulated speed is also manageable (not too slow). Also includes 1G of high speed
5,"For $9.9, you get the best and most reliable network coverage (because using SingTel network). Also 200 call mins is included. On my side, the speed limit will randomly gone sometimes, usually after a phone call"
5,"I have 4 lines with Zero 1, 2 for work tablets, 1 for my dad, and 1 for my work phone that just needs whatsapp.  I can say it does not disappoint.  Sure, speeds are capped after 1GB, but that way when you are paying for your kids or parents lines, you don't have to monitor their data usage and worry about high bills.  very recommended for parents or those who have elderly parents."
4,Zero1 has been great for me since the first day it was launch. Their unlimited data allows me to surf the net without any worries. What's more i am only paying $19 for such a good plan. 
1,"Used to be a fan of them, but their customer service is TERRIBLE. They made a screw-up to my billing in April, and after MANY emails they said they would give me a refund for overcharging me in June. The next bill, the refund STILL wasn't processed.  Cancelled my account and cancelled my credit card linked to the account. "
4,Got about 3 plans for my parents and myself. Works great just that sometimes there might be weak connections.
3,"I decided to sign up for Zero1 when they launched the 1GB to unlimited data plan. At a promo price of $9.90 per month, I would say it is the cheapest plan in town with unlimited data. However, the con was the speed after 1GB of usage, it was really really slow at the controlled speed to the point when you cannot really load much videos on Facebook & Instagram stories.  Overall, I still find it really worth it as the price is really cheap for such a plan with limitless data. If you're someone who do not load much videos, you mainly only use messaging apps and occasionally load some photos on social media then this is the plan for you!  I eventually switched to M1 as my usage pattern changed."
2,"So far i use zero1 is good, but only thing lack of customer service, and today they just have a facebook page https://www.facebook.com/zero1MVPN/, and hopefully they have a hotline to call or live chat instead of email to take a long time to get them reply.  And I just successfully port over from circles life to zero1, but when i turn off the phone, it is under starhub tone, *starhub is unable to get the respond from our customer's mobile phone, pls try again later*, and i though is under singtel tone if cant get through?"
4,"I received my Zero1 simcard on 28 Mar, surprisingly I cant make outgoing calls since the day I received the simcard. I tried to reach out to them via email to inform this issue but so far there is no response from them. I dont know where else to reach them as there is no call centre provided. Anybody experience the same issue?"
5,"Pros: 1. Extremely good coverage and network speed, similar to Singtel (which I was on previously). 2. No additional charge for caller ID 3. No contract 4. If you got in at promotional price, $19 is practically unbeatable 5. First 3GB at 4g speed, unlimited data after at 1.5mbps (around 187kb/s), good enough for web surfing and facebook.  Cons: 1. No heads up for number porting, doesn't let you know when they will cut the current line."
3,"Ordered on Mar 26 and received SIM on April 02 (earliest available delivery date). It's a reasonable delivery speed but compare to Circles.Life delivery (able to select as fast as within 2 days), it's way slower.  First 3GB data speed is 24Mbps/32Mbps and 1Mbps/1Mbps after that. So beware that you might experience video buffering if you are watching movie on HOOQ or slow web page loading with youtube playing music video, even loading facebook is slow after the initial 3GB.  Pro: - Unlimited* data at managed speed after initial 3GB. - Lowest price tag for Unlimited* data. - 200 min Outgoing local call / Unlimited incoming call - 200 Outgoing SMS free / Unlimited incoming SMS - Free registration and SIM card for now  Con: - Unbearable slow network speed after first 3GB. Still usable for normal phone apps e.g. WhatsApp video call, web browsing etc. - They are either overwhelm with orders or still learning how to manage the service. So, response is quite slow.  In summary this plan ($29.90) is suitable for those are very budget conscious."
4,"It was poor signal as given only 3g data connection, but late april its connection get me to 4g. HoweveRÔºåcs and billing lack of interaction.  Can get better..  "
1,"Anyone experience billing issue since April to now.  I had been double charge in my billing. Trying to contact the customer service, via yes@zero1.sg it issue a ticket with no one  responding back."
3,"I am using Zero1 since Nov'18. I am still unable to find any customer care no., My sim was not working at all since today morning and I got network only after 3pm. Can anyone help me with any contact details to connect with Zero1 ?"
1,"I sign up on 27 Jan 19 and received an email to inform me that they will contact me before my current contract ends on 31 Jan 19.  No one contacted me and wrote in again on 28 Feb and was told that they don't have my information. I signed up again on 28 Feb 19 since it says delivery of sim card will take estimated 3 working days. Today I received a message that delivery will be on 11 March 19.   I raised another question to them in the event my mobile along with my sim card gets stolen. What should I do? For other telco , I will call them straight away. For zero 1?I didn't expect all this problems and thought that this could be a better and efficient company. The problem here speaks for itself of my opinion ob the firm now."
4,Good deal for unlimited data. Speed slower. Stayed less than six months and left for full speed telco plan.
4,"Switch to Zero1 from Circles Life. Got it at the early bird price of $19.90/mth. The speed is alright as it taps on SingTel network. Even at controlled speed, I am able to watch Netflix and YouTube smoothly at lower quality. Was pretty upset when I am not able to change to the $9.90 plan as I feel that be it 1GB or 3GB @ full speed it doesn‚Äôt matter. It will be fully consumed in a matter of days.   So I switched to Starhub in December when the promo of $20 for 13GB with free caller ID comes out. "
4,"on the 20th Dec 2018, i had ordered the 1GB to Unlimited zero1 data plan. i read the necessary information needed to understand what i was paying $20 for. (1GB to Unlimited has registration fees which i recall the other two do not) sure enough, i received my sim card after 3 working days which is on the 26 Dec, 12.18 pm. it stated that i may receive my item between 9 am to 1 pm, but i would be more happy if they‚Äôd state that the earliest timing is 11 am instead because i read other reviews and none stated that they received it earlier than that. the delivery man came and asked for my NRIC for verification and the process went well. it stated that activation of sim card will be on the next business day, but being excited receiving my new sim card, i slot it into my phone and obviously it stated ‚Äúno service‚Äù. the next day though, around 11.30 am, (23 hours after receiving) i powered off my iphone and slot the sim card again. to my expectation, it was activated successfully! i was so excited and decided to try using the data and sure enough it worked well. i didn‚Äôt try calling or sms-ing directly after activation though so i can‚Äôt talk much about that. but sooner or later i called and picked up calls and the line was great - no poor connection or anything like that. this is where it gets interesting. when i‚Äôve already used 800 MB of data, an sms was sent to me stating i have used up 80% of my 1GB unlimited data plan. after using up 1GB of data, the connection wasn‚Äôt as fast as 4G, but it was fine for me. loading of pictures and videos on instagram and twitter was sometimes fine and sometimes slow, but overall, it was okay for me. youtube works just fine too. i play PUBG frequently but so far the process was normal- great just like using wifi to play. about hotspot, my sister doesn‚Äôt have mobile data, so often she‚Äôd use my hotspot to play PUBG with me and so far so good, nothing bad happened. i was and actually still is afraid that i shouldn‚Äôt be sharing my data but from experience it was all fine, but i wouldn‚Äôt share it for too long. overall quality: 7.5/10 if i have a choice, i‚Äôd definitely recommend this telco to those who want or need unlimited data at a great price without contract. price of 1GB to Unlimited as of now: $9.9/mth but overall payment is $20.40 incl. registration & a few more services i couldn‚Äôt remember. thank you for reading. i hope you find my review helpful ü§ó"
1,"a lot of hidden cost involve ... example : 1gb to unlimited connection fees $10 . then a local sms to my standard chart bank to activate my credit card , i got charge 60 cents , bill says it is a international sms ...( 75722 ) i call bank n ask they said is a local number ( 75722 ) ... n the worst thing is the support , no one to call to... only email . i wonder what will happen if lost hp n u need to stop the line urgently . then promised zero1 apps but after so long nothing is done . no inform us also ...ZERO1 if u want to stay on pls improved !!!"
3,"I was one of those who managed to get the $19.90 per month promo. But eventually, I signed up with Circles.Life instead because this is a relatively new telco while Circles.Life has been around for about 2 years (Unsure about how they go about resolving issues - customer support etc.). Zero1 also doesn't have a mobile application like Circles.Life, so I hope that they will release a mobile application soon. Overall, after looking at the reviews from other consumers, I'm glad that I went with Circles.Life instead."
5,I like Zero1 its a best data and talktime plan for foreigners.  Their facebook Page  https://facebook.com/Zero1PteLtd
3,"4 stars for the product 2 stars for the customer service  The plan is cheap and good at initial launch promo price.  There's currently no way to check your usage, but they mentioned in the website that they're working on an app. The data after the initial 3GB is okay for me since I'm not a heavy data user. Loading YouTube videos is not bad (little to no buffering) but with low resolution.  The sign up process was quite easy and straightforward, everything was done online smoothly.  However, their customer service needs A LOT of improvement. The only mode of contact that I know of is email. When I had to email them to port over my number, they took days to reply each email and I was quite frustrated as it took a really long time to resolve an issue with the other telco and get my number ported. "
4,"Pretty good for the (Promo) price, but still decent at the current price of 30  Choose this if you don't care about speed and just want a no fuss, no worry to your data needs. They don't cap or limit tethering. use it however you want.  Customer service needs to improve though.  (as noted by some of the other reviews. But as what another reviewer said it should be early teething problems and should be solved soon. Own personal experience has been smooth with the exception of porting which was sudden and without advanced warning.  Waiting for the app and roaming plans soon  . but locally, I think for my usage case they're the best fit (for now)"
3,"I have circleslife for 7gb/ month with corporate promo at $28/ month.  Got the zero1 at promo price of $19/month too (not i paying though.. so.. :))  I exceeded the zero1 first 3gb.. subsequent data speed varies, but most of the time it does not show 4g anymore. Eg: streaming of social media videos, loading social media app, downloading updates. 1 word, SLOW. They said it does not affect the speed in YouTube, but i seldom use that. So not very sure.  Zero1 is basically for people that needs unlimited data at an affordable price but can handle slow data speed after the 1st 3gb. If you don't mind slow speed, then zero1 is for you. Super worth it as we got it at $19."
5,"All right here's my review of zero 1 after 2 months of usage.  I am one of the early sign up so my price plan is a mere 19 bucks. I get :  200mins talk time 4G data (3gb) 3G data (unlimited)  So most of us ask what happens after you burst the 3G data. I have been bursting it everyone month after like 15 days into the month. So here's a list of what you can and cant do after bursting  Can: surf Facebook and watch Facebook video WhatsApp, WhatsApp video call Play simple mobile games like hearthstone. Spotify without pre download works   Can't. Stream movies  Play games like pubg mobile.  Others: expect webpages to load slower, especially if they are legacy website with a chuck of data."
4,"For what you're paying ($19.90) its a bargain. Unlimited usage so your kids can watch youtube all the time and no bill shock. Perfect for non-gamers so if you want a phone with data but not too fussed about speed then this is for you. Initial teething problems due to this being a new company, but I expect backlog to clear in the next couple of weeks. "

5,One of the best rates electricity provider and with great customer service when I had some issues and questions. Will continue with them. Keep it up the good work.
5,Very good rates as compared to other electricity provider. It is a paperless billing as the billing will send out via email. Bill format is similar to SP easy to understand. ¬†I have already and will definitely continue to recommend your services to others in the future. 
4,Process to switch Diamond is very easy and hassle free. Info available on net is good enough to make decision.. very satisfied 
5,"No lock in period, highest discount off tariff, bill rebates ... all checked. But what is most important for me is the customer experience. So far I have been provided with a Diamond service.

5,"No hidden costs, no security deposit, guaranteed savings each month, switching over could not have been made any easier. Customer service every step of the way."
5,"Used to be DBS' travel insurance if I recall correctly. Application was very seamless and prompt, enjoyed using it during my travels even though I never had the chance to claim."
5,"I lost my handphone overseas and was in a total state of panic. Lucky for me, the claim process was super easy and intuitive, and your staff was super helpful as well when I was at my lowest. Thank you so much for the great experience and I will definitely recommend you to my friends and family!"
5,"Very easy application and claim process. Terms and conditions were clearly stated and would not be misunderstood easily. User interface was also very easy to navigate. Overall, I had a very good experience with MSIG"
4,"My husband travels frequently overseas for work, so I always buy  travel insurance for him since his company does not provide insurance for staffs. I usually compared the prices and benefits of the insurance through platforms such as Go bear, moneysmart, seedly  After comparing various travel insurances, I chose MSIG because 1) competitive price of MSIG, I was given a further 50% discount when applying online 2) Increased limits for Terrorism Cover 3) Increased emergency medical evacuation cover from $500,000 to $1,000,000 for the Standard Plan  I rated it 4 stars now because the insurance purchase is really hassle free and easy. But I think the real test for any insurance is when you need to make a claim. Since I have not made a claim, I will reserve the last star for the future."
5,"I will buy travel insurance whenever I travel and may not be the same insurance company.  My choice would be based on the coverage, discounts offered and the reputation / reliability of the insurance company.  I chose MSIG travel insurance because for the same coverage, they offer better discounts compared to others during certain promotions.  Purchasing the travel insurance online was also easy and the webpage is user friendly.  I don‚Äôt usually make any claims but for that one occasion, I find the process simple and quick.  It was hassle free and I didn‚Äôt have to wait too long to receive the cheque."
5,"Once the unluckiest incident was that I had terrible gastric flu on my last day trip. I felt like almost dying and almost cannot walk because I'm feel very uncomfortable. As a result, I'm got poisoned and have to pay for the medical fees in overseas. Glad I'm always buy travel insurance.  A medical emergency can wipe out all savings or even worse. I use and trust MISG Singapore  as claims are easily done. "
5,MSIG really live up to its motto MSIG Travel Easy! :) Travelled recently and bought insurance from MSIG! :) Cheapest and with wide range of coverage just like others! :) Fuss free coz can be bought online where all the terms and conditions are clearly stated :) Two thumbs up and will definitely use MSIG again for my next trip! ;)
5,"MSIG is one of the most trustable insurance companies. With their partnership with DBS just makes everything better. Their competitive pricing and informative website, made my insurance coverage affordable, swift and manageable. Few clicks away and I‚Äôm ready for my trip even if it‚Äôs at the last minute on the mobile-friendly site! Love the way they held promotions and keeping their visuals relational to their customers. In addition, claims process was effortless and prompt. Definitely will subscribe from MSIG again in future.   Introduced MSIG to my family and colleagues, all of them felt the same. "
3,"We were looking for coverage that include adventurous activities as we were doing cycling, hiking, and also were considering bungee jumping. Hence, overseas medical coverage and extreme sports were important. MSIG's plan seemed to meet our needs. The application process was easy. Not sure about claiming because (thank goodness) we need not make any claims through them. Don't think it's the cheapest hence the 3 stars.. but we might use it again depending on our needs. :)"
3,"Fair coverage. Might not be ideal for people who do a lot of outdoor sports and activities oversea as the standard plan does not cover that. Also standard plan might be quite hefty without discounts so unless you are looking for basic coverage, I would recommend upgrading to other plans or look at other more specifically tailored alternatives."
5,I had a sore eye last year in the midst of my travel . I went to see a doctor there and follow by the local doctor . I am Glad that MSIG allows me to claim back my medical Fees hassle free and able to claim back my money real soon. I like the family travel insurance that coverage myself and my whole family 
4,"Msig TravelEasy occasionally has promotions up to 60% discount of single trip for various timing of the year. Without the discounts, it is definitely not one of the cheapest in the market. A few of the benefits where it has the advantage over other insurer is the cover for adventurous activities as well as cover for wedding clothing and accessories."
5,"My go to insurance partner whenever I travel overseas!! Premiums are affordable and usually have 50% or 60% discounts! Also, the coverage is pretty decent as compared to other insurers.  Most importantly, they provide a good amount for delayed baggage which is important. Once I had my baggage delayed for 48 hours and I managed to claim $1,200 (cap for the basic plan). The whole process was fuss free and quick and i got my cheque shortly after returning from the trip.   During the trip, the staff was also very reassuring that I could go ahead to spend on the necessary items I needed without worrying.  Would definitely recommend MSIG travel easy to everyone!  "
5,"I bought from them quite a few times and only recently helped to claim for my mum and aunt. Hassle free and pretty efficient, from my claim report to the received of cheque less than 2 weeks (within 10 working days) im satisfied with them. Keep up the good work! "
5,"I purchase MSIG Travel Insurance for me and my wife during Phuket Trip.  Unfortunately, we got accident during taking a boat to phi phi islands. bruise due to fell down from the boat, when we got back to singapore we checked to Doctor and claim to insurance, the customer service was good and smoothly."
5,Once I totally forgot to purchase my travel insurance and I was already at the airport departure hall. Their online purchase was super easy n quick. Had it done within 10 minutes. Good for absent minded people like me. Haha
4,Bought it for my recent trip to paros. Easy to buy onljne and reasonable price. Thankfully no need to claim so all good.
5,"Easy purchase online and been purchasing it for past few years even they stop working with DBS, I still buy from them due to the good experience.  So far claim process only once for medical (~$60+) and it was fast within a week after submitting all claims online (Soft copy).  Will still continue to buy MSIG."
5,MSIG travel insurance was a lifesaver when my mum has acute gastroenteritis in Bangkok with vomitting and high fever. I called the hotline and they are able to provide timely advice (like should I bring to hospital or what is the process like) and able to get medical assistance quickly. The claim process was smooth and got back my reimbursement in 2-3 weeks after submitting. Exceeded my expectations for a travel insurance.
4,"There always seems to be some kind of discount no matter when they tell you it'll expire. But buying the insurance was really quick and simple. I chose this because they had decent coverage for medical expenses (in case you kena food poisoning) and the greatest value for money on theft & travel cancellation benefits.   Anyway, medical expenses are already covered by your personal accident plan if you have one, so looking for travel-oriented accidents like theft or flight cancellations should be your priority!"
4,"MSIG TravelEasy Travel Insurance is easy and straightforward to use (for millennials). I used it for my trip overseas where I also lost my phone. The claiming process was amazing! Fast response from the team, just submit your document and you will receive your claimed cheque from them in 3-5 working days.  The claim for the lost phone is only $500 though (maximum) and I paid $136 for that insurance so that might be the only downside. Was hoping to claim more. "
4,"I have been purchasing from Allianz since early this year (2018). Used to buy from OCBC (Great Eastern) due to 25%/50% off premiums if you're a OCBC card holder but with all the recent spate of regional unrest (N. Korea and all) decided to grab a travel insurance with terrorism coverage.  MSIG & Allianz stood out when it comes to Terrorism coverage.  For comparison purposes, both insurance quote for single trip, 10 days Asean country for 1 adult below 70yo. MSIG Elite ($39 first 3 days, $5/day thereafter total $74; add in 50% discount off = $37) vs Allianz Single trip silver ($32.45 discounted price; before was $59) Allianz wins in terms of value for me because I focus more on medical expenses/theft etc.. A short comparison of benefits that matters more to me as below:  Overseas emergency due to sickness/accident: MSIG $500,000 vs Allianz $1,000,000 Overseas Emergency Dental: MSIG $6000 vs Allianz 1,000,000 TCM treatment: MSIG $400 (never indicate local or overseas) vs Allianz $300 each for local & overseas Delayed luggage: MSIG $250/6hrs capped at $1000 vs Allianz $200/6 hrs capped at $1400 Loss or damage to luggage: MSIG $5000 vs Allianz $6000 (both $1000 for laptop and other effects capped at $500 each) Flight diversion: MSIG $100 vs Allianz $200 every 6 hrs Terrorism: MSIG $200,000 vs Allianz $80,000 Accidental death and perm total disability: MSIG $200,000 (non specified) vs Allianz $80,000 + 80,000 (death on commercial flight)  So far I've been lucky not to use the hotline for claims but I have called them a few times to clarify on some doubts and the customer service knows their stuffs well =) "
5,"I used to buy my travel insurance from NTUC Income because it seems to be the cheapest in the market. However I started switching to MSIG when I realise the price can be quite comparable/competitive when they offer a discount (they offer discount quite frequently). What I find specifically superior about MSIG's coverage is that baggage delay can be claimed in blocks of 6 hours when most insurers cover in blocks of 8 hours. This proved to be of value to me when I found myself experiencing a 36 hours delay in my baggage when taking MAS to Seoul. When I first arrived at Incheon Airport and found out that my lugguage was still stuck at KL airport during the stopover, I called the MSIG travel insurance helpdesk and the customer service officer was very patient to assure me of my coverage and also explain to me what I need to do in order to smoothen my claim process. He informed me that I should secure a delivery receipt with date/time stamp when receiving my luggage from MAS. I tried to do this but MAS was incompetent in providing this information despite several calls and emails to them during and after the trip. With no choice I wrote to MSIG to explain to them my poor experience with MAS and how I am unable to secure evidence of how long my delay was. MSIG to my surprise and delight, not only responded to me quickly (within a week) but decided to give me benefit of the doubt and paid out to me maximum claim for the delay ($900 x 3 pax = $2.7k). I cannot remember exactly how long it took to receive the payout in my bank account but my impression was it didn't take long. Due to this pleasant experience (albeit unpleasant travel experience) with MSIG, I highly recommend everyone to consider buying from them too. [For the sake of comparison: MAS eventually responded to me after several threats made including on social media but only after I received my payout from MSIG. What a disparity in service between the two!]"
4,Quite an easy onboarding process through their partner POSB most of the time. Am glad not to have put their customer service and claims in the process.  So far so good. 
3,Their claimant process not as good as Chubb insurance. They are not as ‚Äòrelax‚Äô as other insurance provider. I can see that tiq is very active in pulling customers now. Would like to try tiq soon!
1,"ONE OF THE WORST INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THR WORLD! With brainless PIGS working in this company. Without any knowledge of any medical stuff, they assume what they know. IDIOTS"
5,"MSIG goes above and beyond to protect what you hold dear. We provide comprehensive general insurance plans for all your travel, motor and etc"
5,Travel Insurance products I taken on 2 years ago and gently share and request to increase the timeline to appeal.
5,"You have done a great deed! Without you, my travel will never be the same! Thank you for your great help! "
5,The product features are comprehensive and premiums are competitive. Application process is straightforward and simple. Entire customer journey is pleasant! Great üëçüèª 
5,Easy to purchase online. The website is also user-friendly as just need to upload the  bills when i submit for medical claims.  The waiting time for processing my claims was quite fast too. Have bought from them a few times. 
4,"easy to buy, price is good, no problem so far but have not claim before and i hope i never need to claim"
4,Recommended as their insurance is usually one of the most value-for-money (more than just being one of the cheapest) and application is fuss-free!
5,"I lost my phone while skiing overseas,i was able to make my claim immediately back and was able to get it credited within a week to get my new phone."
5,"MSIG coverage is very comprehensive and their staffs are so professional and quick in assisting their customers, always render great service! Keep it up MSIG! "
4,MSIG travelmade easy is true to its name. Easy and flexible coverage. Pick and pay what you need. Great deal to an awesome holiday. No more worries
4,"Bought it once before for my recent trip as I‚Äôve heard good reviews about it. But personally have not claimed yet.. so unable to tell whether the claiming process is hassle-free. But overall, purchasing process was quick and smooth"
5,"Very reliable, info and details are clear, pretty straightforward and easy to apply/process. They have many good promotions too!"
5,"Recently bought my travel insurance from MSIG for an Uzbekistan trip. As there were flight delay issues, i managed to submit my claim easily & hassle free last month through their online portal. No messy procedures."
4,Easy to purchase and hassle free. Can be done over the internet! Price pretty affordable too! Would recommend to friends and use in future!
5,I travel a lot with my family and MSIG Travel Easy really makes my travel easily with great assurance with its precise coverage that I can be assured on . Plus enquires on phone easily sorted out ! 
5,Easy to apply with comprehensive coverage and information. Reasonable and competitive pricing as they have promotions now and then. Definitely one of the top choices to consider!
5,Have tried MSIG travel insurance recently about 3 months back where i brought my wife and mother in law for star cruise trip. The policy was quite comprehensive and well covered. Most important the premium was quite reasonable. Highly recommended.
5,"Buy once on 2018 if not mistaken. That time I were travel to Thailand Bangkok. Although it is more expensive compare to others, but it did provide higher compensation. Depend to your travel style, it might suit you well. "
4,Everything was seamless from researching to deciding what I want to purchase! I had an ease of mind and overall will use it again! 
5,"Great product, bought the travel insurance 2 years back during my trip to italy and make claims of $3k which was fuss free:)"
5,Cheap and super easy way to buy this travel insurance especially online. They will give you a soft copy of the insurance which you can keep for reference when you are overseas. Got to know about this brand through its pairing with DBS and since then have been buying it when travelling abroad by myself. 
5,Affordable price and reliable provider. Been using MSIG all along and I also like the formatting on their documents 
2,"Average experience with them, I need to manually submit my claim in hardcopy, either postage or travel down to the office and submit the proof of my item receipt and medical claim."
5,Bought MSIG travel insurance for my previous travel. Competitive pricing with sufficient benefits and coverage. Will recommend to my friends!
5,"Recently bought the MSIG travel insurance for a long holiday to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Choose MSIG because it is affordable and with good coverage. more importantly, there is good customer service if you need a claim. "
4,"Easy to purchase online. I made a claim for my parents once, claim process was quite straight forward but processing is a bit slow. "
4, i used MSIG annual insurance and i claimed a few times and everything can claim. they are always nice and professional.
5,Easy to sign up and buy! also covers pre-exisiting conditions hence worth to buy in ppl with premorbidities.
5,Fuss free online application. My claiming experience was also a breeze by submitting the supporting documents. Took about a month from claim application till cheque receipt.
5,"MSIG is a good company with a easy to use interface, convenient access, user-friendly online website and easy to understand terms and conditions for their insurance policies."
5,Purchased this plan twice! It‚Äôs easy to purchase and has one of the highest coverage that was suitable for the type of holiday I was going for! 
5,"Good coverage,affordable and easy to claim. My most choice of travel insurance for myself and my family members."
4,Have had to call to ask about using our travel insurance due to a sick child shortly before we were due to leave. It was a bit of a pain but it meant I had to contact each provider individually to get an email about whether they would or wouldn‚Äôt refund us before MSIG would actually get involved and refund us. Thankfully all the providers offered us a direct refund with the doctors letter and hospital paperwork. So didn‚Äôt actually use the MSIG insurance but they were responsive even if they didn‚Äôt actually pay out anything.  And they did indicate they would likely cover if the provider wouldn‚Äôt. 
4,When I travel and need travel insurance I'll buy from MSIQ. It's always been my first choice. Application is easy and the rates are competitive.
5,Fast purchase via online and competitive rate offered by this insurer. Had a medical claim from them without any question asked. Cheque sent to me after a few weeks
5,"I have always be using MSIG travel insurance. The claim process is easy and fast. I have claimed for medical bills, spoilt phone. There is 50% discount on and off, which is quite a good deal!"
4,"Purchased MSIG Travel Easy through PolicyPal, the rates are really competitive as compared to others. Another reason was that it is recommended by Seedly as the Best Overall Value."
4,"Good value when there is 40% discount. Able to claim for tcm treatments after paper submission. Took 2-3 weeks to get my claims, pretty quick"
5,"Truth to be told MSIG is one of the most underrated insurance companies. However their partnership with DBS just makes everything better. with their competitive pricing and informative website, it made my insurance coverage vert swift and manageable. Few clicks and i was ready for my Bangkok trip last month! Love how they always have promotions and constantly changing their visuals to keep things relational to their customers. Willluse them again in future. "
1,"It was terrible, i'll recommend everyone to avoid it. I always purchase my via MSIG. First time I claim due to travel delays more than 6hrs. then they inisist its less than 6hrs min. It is clearly stated on the airline letters. why would I claim anything that is not applicable in the terms and conditions as my job is a contracting legal services too. I'm very disappointed. if only I can rate with no stars at all. WARNING TO ALL "
4,I always bought MSIG travel insurance as they always had been promoted by DBS and they have the most competitive rates. I never tried claiming before though so I don‚Äôt know how good or helpful is their claims department. 
4,"Have decided to use MSIG for the past few trips. I find the products very clearly explained on the websites, as well as the claims process. Claimed for medical a couple of times and it was seamless - reimbursed pretty quickly. Giving 4 stars cause I‚Äôve never made a claim more than $100 before, so I‚Äôm unsure if the process will be seamless for large amounts."
5,"Love MSIG because they always have one of the most competitive rates for their best coverage, and some banks have discount with them. On one of the trips, my friend had to return back to Singapore early due to a family emergency, and the claims process was effortless and promptly. Their online booking website is simple and mobile-friendly too!"
5,"I'm a loyal msig client for about 5 years now! their claims are straightforward, fuss-free and fast! claimed delayed baggage once and a few times for medical expenses already. Guess what, I just signed up the annual plan for my family!"
5,I bought the MSIG travel insurance direct from their website. I have been buying from them for quite some time. On one of the trips it was put to the test when my husband‚Äôs wallet was stolen overseas. The claim process is pretty hassle-free as we had all the necessary documents ready eg the police report. The customer service was also helpful when we called them from overseas. Pretty positive experience. 
4,"I first heard of it because of the recommendation by a financial agent (not msig or bank), but i ended up applying for this travel insurance a few times.   All because of the ease of application on its platform, considerably extensive coverage and special offers (though I always wonder whether I am lucky or they are on permanent special offers?). I did look at other offers as well.  I have bought both the annual plan (because I was overseas for a total of at least three months) and the one time plan. Both options are reasonably priced and pretty competitive, even though they may not be the cheapest sometimes. "
5,Victor and Rusmin made the dividend machine course really entertaining and enjoyable with their personal stories and experiences. Their points were really succinct and easy to grasp. Would definitely recommend those who are new and are interested in dividend investing.
3,"The content in their 'dividend' course is nothing new to be honest, can very easily go online and learn it yourself. However the trainers are very passionate and can meet people of similar interest at their course, that's about it. "
3,"Attended Dividend machines and alpha lab.  Easy to apply for the courses online, all payments are done online. 30 day money back guarantee.  Dividend machines Course videos are easy to follow and very full of information. You get a checklist which can be used to do your own analysis on stocks.  Alpha lab is more into stocks analysis and case studies, where the trainers pick out undervalued stocks and analyse them in a series of videos. Stocks covered are global.  There is a forum available for asking of questions where the trainers are quite responsive in answering your queries.  My only gripe here is that you do not know the trainers actual portfolio. Do they actually walk the talk and buy the stocks they analysed as undervalued? And at what price did they buy? "
5,"Attended Dividends Machine in early 2018 and I have learnt alot from Victor & Rusmin both through the online learning resources and the Live workshop. Definitely value for money with their lifetime membership, plenty of web seminars to follow up throughout the year too."
5,"Rusmin and Victor had always been inspiring in those courses that I took for the past years, including the recent one I attended last week. It was beneficial to those keen in investment and also provided an insight on how we can learn and improve in our investing journey. Frankly, I not only benefited the knowledge and skill in these courses, I actually gained financially (In 5 figures) thru those learning by applying in my investment. Such as Breadtalk, DBS, Hang Lung, to name a fews. I would not be able to explore these valuable stocks at the appropriate time for investment, without their analysis provided for our learning and guidance. After the course last week, I subscribed to Pro-dividend machine, which again, it is beneficial to enhance my investment portfolio. Most important lesson that I gained from these course I attended by Fifth Person is: You have to act upon those learning to realize the dream of investing for our future.   Kudos to you all in fifth person! Look forward to the meet-up soon!"
5,I personally really loved the workshop. I would highly recommend this to most beginners who are getting their feet wet into dividend investing or looking to grow your wealth over a long period of time with income stocks.  You will be able to answer questions like this:  https://seedly.sg/questions/how-do-we-time-the-best-entry-to-buy-stocks-for-example-at-which-point-they-are-the-lowest-so-that-we-can-maximise-our-gains with really good course material as well so you can start identifying and creating your own stock portfolio and watchlists.
5,"Extremely informative and highly recommended for beginners (even seasoned pros) seeking to better understand dividend investing and REITs. Even if you don't have the money to invest yet, it's worth listening to what Victor and Rusmin have to say before you make your judgement."
5,I have joined dividend machine since 2015 and have came back to refresh my content for the 2nd time. Totally worth it. Good value.
5,"I have attended Dividendmachines, Investment Quadrant and Deep Value Detector.  Victor and Rusmin are friendly and approachable, sharing their experiences and knowledge to novice investors who are starting out like me.  The courses are well structured and forms the base of my investment analysis even today. I had read quite a few books, but it was the shared experience of the trainers who help me piece everything together and build up my competency. I'm still using their materials today for my own investing.  The price is value for money for the amount of knowledge taught.  Thanks guys :)  I would like to also thank Jun Hao too for explaining how deep value investing actually works and his ideas of the credit cycle. The perspective on banks and property conglomerates helped me to condense the information that I could apply too.  You can find my reviews on my blog here: http://az-ra-el.blogspot.com/2015/07/weekend-at-dividend-machines-workshop.html http://az-ra-el.blogspot.com/2017/06/a-weekend-at-investment-quadrant.html http://az-ra-el.blogspot.com/2016/11/a-weekend-at-fifth-persons-deep-value.html"
5,"I've attended two of the Fifth Person's courses, and several of their events. The Dividend Machines and Investment Quadrant courses provide a straightforward and systematic approach to evaluating securities investment opportunities. Although the focus is mainly on shares listed in Singapore, the same general approach works equally well in any market.   Dividend Machines provides participants with a simple 8 step evaluation process to analyse the type of shares that would form part of an out-performing income portfolio. This is an especially useful course for anybody considering investments in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and building a retirement portfolio to generate passive income.     All of the Fifth Person events I've attended, and especially the training courses, are well organised and presented. The course material is easy to understand and comprehensive course notes were provided.   Whether you're an experienced stockmarket investor, or a complete novice, you will learn a tremendous amount in a short amount of time. I strongly recommend that anybody considering investing in dividend shares to generate passive income  attends Dividend Machines. I'd also highly recommend the Investment Quadrant course as a means of developing a more disciplined, systematic and effective means of evaluating investments."
5,"There is a saying ""I'd rather hustle 24/7 than slave my life 9/6."" This is 'THE' course if you wanna get your hands dirty towards financial road freedom - one possible way through dividend compound investment.  Instructed with easy-to-follow tips on how one can build their dividend portfolio through tested and proven strategies.   Absolutely worth every penny. coached from the young financial gurus!! Highly recommended!!"
5,"I first went for Dividend Machines in 2015, followed by Investment Quadrant in 2017. On both occasions, I was a paying student and felt it was worth every single cent I paid. In fact, I honestly think their courses are severely underpriced for the massive value that they provide to all students who attend. My only regret is that I didn't attend their courses SOONER.  Everyone whom I've recommended this course to have only thanked me for it, and I'll continue recommending this for as long as they continue to deliver because my reputation is on the line when I endorse them, lol.  Rusmin and Victor's value investing strategy is very much aligned with mine, but they win my respect in terms of how much effort they put into really researching and analysing all their stock picks prior to putting their money in. You'll learn how to analyse and think for yourself, how to identify the common red flags that many people easily overlook, and REALLY find value gems instead of being lured by the value / dividend traps.

5,"The online course is very useful as we can  review again and again to gain more clarity. Rusmin and Victor did a very good job, making the subject less dry and very engaging during the live workshop. Highly recommended!"
5,"It was more than what I expected out of a class. This is the first paid class i did, wished I signed up earlier and not simply just reading blogs. They gave good tips and structured learning skills sets to set you out on your own investment journey. Glad there is such a good team behind this. The slides could have been better organised, because at times the trainer jumped quite a bit. But this is just a very very small issue. Thank you very much for the session!"
5,"Trainers have shared with us the systematic ways and process on how to evaluate the stocks performance, dividend outlook and is it worth to invest."
4,This is the first paid course that I have joined. And it is quite worth. I like the case study most.

4,"Pretty good one, it's the first paid class that I attended. It provides me stuctured analysis that I knew some of it before, but has no idea how to utilize altogether to select good stock. It's the laziness that still hold me back to start investing. Since I read through online material before coming to workshop, so big part is repetitive from what I've learned, prefer to have more case study. Suggestion, you can have 2 settings of workshop, one withmoew case study."
5,Rusmin and Victor were very approachable and engaging as course lecturers! The learning points on dividend investing were very useful.   Will 100% recommend this course!
5,1 of the most valued for money courses you can find now with both online content that you can access however and once a year workshop. I personally come for a refresher after 4 years after I joined their very first session. Very good content for income investing.

5,"Victor and Rusmin kept the class entertained with their anecdotes and jokes, even though it‚Äôs 9-7pm the class didn‚Äôt feel that Long! As a complete newbie, it‚Äôs a great class that taught me some of the things to look out for when evaluating which stock to pick, and there‚Äôs a comprehensive step by step process to analyse the stocks. Definitely gave me more confidence to start investing the right way."
4,"Good session, need more case study n like both trainers. Need that to carry on my investment trip..."
4,The course is very informative and the 8-steps that detail the criteria to assess income stocks is insightful. I have sourced a lot of information through websites and investment books but many are just theories. It is hard to apply the same theories on your own. Life case studies are also shared during the course.
5,"Great online course and workshop for beginners, workshop was engaging and there were several examples and lesson learn being shared.  Would recommend everyone to join."
5,The course was good and the trainers was engaging. Get to gain some basic knowledge on how to source/ filter out the right stocks to invest too! Would recommend ppl who want to start investing but do not where to start to attend the course !
4,"Had the challenge of not knowing where to start, but after attending the workshop I now at least have an idea of where to begin my research and how. The class was straight to the point and they were quality content. Systematic steps were taught that can be applied irl, albeit time consuming if all is done by myself in my own time. Would recommend!"
5,I enjoyed that Ruskin and Victor explained their concept on stock and REITs  in a simple manner.   I did some self help book for a while and struggle to understand the concepts. The practical part is how to buy and sell. Recommend this course to something new to investing
5,Simple to understand yet comprehensive investment framework. Ties up all the loose ends and pieces together so that we as investors see the whole picture. Definitely improved a lot in my investment decision making. A must attend!
5,"The class was informative and easy to understand. It helped to clear up some confusion about the concepts of investing, especially for a beginner. Thanks Rusmin and Victor for the session."
5,I really like the methodical and practical approach that Victor and Rusmin have conducted the Dividend Machines Workshop last Sunday. They are practictioners and gladly shared their mistakes and successes. An essential skill for every stocks investor. Strongly encourage participation by many.
5,"Trainers are very engaging and friendly, impressed by their knowledge and the amount of legwork they have done in analysing their investments. Given the price point this is a barebones essential course enough to give you confidence to get started on income investing"
5,Thank you Rusmin and Victor for sharing your knowledge.   Very informative one day session and learnt a lot of things. Recommended to anyone who would like to start their investing journey.
4,I liked the exercises. The morning class could be slower. Struggled to follow the 8 steps. Afternoon was easier. May be it is just simplier conceptually
5,The workshop is easy to understand and make me aware of the current situation for investing. I have gain a few set of techniques on how to select stock.
4,"The course is not dry and interactive with quizzes, queries on the spot with the instructors. The methodology is helpful with checklist and instructors explains the context with examples."
5,"Good content, very informative and value for money! Would definitely recommend to others.  Lecturer were very funny."
5,"Just attended the course as  refresher and very happy with it. Clear systematic system to follow, focusing on giving good advice over getting rich quick and super fast response on the q&a. No regrets with the course, strongly recommend"
5,"Had a very good session and easier to understand the concept. The speakers delivered the content very clearly. But for a newbie, it's a bit too fast. Maybe a 2 day course would be better."
4,Very informative and practical ways to screen shares. Its good and can consider to recommend to others
5,Sharing was candid and honest. Victor and Rusmin has skin in the game and shows an extensive knowledge in the field. Highly recommended.
5,The concepts in DM are clear and easy to grasp. The online platform focus a lot on the steps to identify a good dividend stock whereas DM Pro workshops are designed to provide market updates and analysis on their stocks in the charity portfolio. Highly recommended to beginners and even season investors.
4,"Deliver good content, gave many study cases to learn their success and fail experiences. Highly recommend to those who started to invest and avoid the mistakes most people made when starting investing."
5,"Value for money, interesting, informative, practical. Good content. Enough jokes and stories. Strong enough jokes."
5,"Well done, I love it.  I learn a lot but I especially like the dividend machine professional. I m usually very busy working to horde up funds for dividend stocks, so this website will really help me to set up the watch list of stocks to buy for dividends when the crash comes."
5,"I'm a newbie investor though I've read fairly extensively on investment stuff.  Rusmin & Victor, thank you for the fun & informative session. I've learnt many new things which I never knew before.  The 8 steps Dividends Machine model to access if a stock is suitable as an income stock investment and the REITS selection process were excellent."
5,Informative and a lot of facts and sharing from real life experience. also learn from other students asking all sorts of questions. quiz test your understanding. awesome session.
5,Fifth Person has been able to conduct a dry topic in a manner which is enjoyable and fun to learn. Dividend Machines is the place if you want to learn income strategies! Awesome!
5,Very structured breakdown to understand how to spot income stocks and REITS. I'll recommend for everyone
5,Excellent course for any person seeking to buy dividend stock. Practical and detailed. Allowing me to watch for proper entry timing
5,Great course with simple concepts and very passionate trainers - Victor and Rusmin. Greatly recommended for everyone! :)
5,"The trainers delivered the concepts in a clear and easy to understand manner. The case studies and course materials provided a good context to the steps, rationale and mindset any investor should adopt to be successful in investing. Beginners or intermediate investors alike will enjoy the course. Will definitely recommend this course to anyone seeking to kickstart their investing journey ;)"
5,I didn't know anything about REITs before signing up. Great intro to write and sharing in the workshop. The online materials are also comprehensive with videos. Also pleased to know I can come back for revision in future workshops  Good value for money and highly recommended
4,Very informative course. Can really learn a lot. I would strongly recommend to anyone interested in investing in dividends stocks and reits.
4,The course is easy to follow and understand. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to have steady passive income
4,Simple to understand and supplemented with relevant case studies. Trainers are very passionate in sharing their knowledge and experience in dividend investing.
4,A good course for everyday retail investors looking for a workable strategy for consistent dividend yields. Recommended.
5,"Before joining Dividends Machine, I was confused by the amount of different advice given by various websites and books on how to value stocks. After joining, and attending the workshop, I‚Äôve now a much clearer idea on how to screen, value and buy dividend stocks. The best part about this program is the quick response you‚Äôll get in the Q&A forums. My only regret was joining the program earlier! And yes, if anyone asks, I‚Äôll definitely recommend them to join Dividend Machines."
5,"Wonderful course to attend, whether first time or as refresher...  Besides getting insights, sharing about things that were inaccessible to lay person, Rusmin and Victor are authentic in sharing their personal challenges and setbacks.   I would recommend this course to my closed ones."
5,A disciplined way of fundamentally approaching investing into cash machines. Highly recommended though one needs to have the right temperament for value investment
4,The course provide a systemic structure for me to analyze the stocks.  In my stocks i can use that to filter away the lousy stocks.
4,Would definitely recommend this course to beginner investors as the instructors are able to present the concepts into simple forms and are thoroughly knowledgeable about their stuff. Reasonable course price compared to the other investment courses out there!
5,The workshop was very comprehensive and easy to follow even for a newly minted investor. I have definitely learnt a lot and will practice the skills shared!
5,"Just attended the Dividend Machines Live workshop yesterday.  1) Practical Examples and Training Videos -  It has been improved with more practical examples, but due to the time constraints, we have to watch the training Videos at their platform.  2) Performance of their Charity Portfolio and. Potential Watchlist  Now they show us a glimpse of their charity portfolio that they invested to fund their charity fund which they started more than 3 years ago. The full performance details are only accessible in their Professional membership,which also included more analysis reports and Watchlist of potential stocks for investing in Dividend Income and REITs Income. 3) Long Term Investment for Dividend and REIT Income investing  Before joining Dividend Machines course, my Biggest investment challenge was deciding on good stocks for long term investment.  4) Online platform for Training Videos and Q&A for submitting Questions and learning at your own pace.  It's a bonus that they also provided an online training platform that is good for busy people to attend at own pace and also while on overseas trip. We can submit questions on the platform, as we learn at our own pace.  5) Live workshop that you can attend repeatedly.  Another bonus is that we could attend the Live workshop repeatedly for Free,  which is very useful for slow learners.  I would definitely recommend Dividend Machines to anyone who wants to start creating passive income as soon as possible"
4,The biggest challenge before I joined the workshop was the myriad of contrasting information in the internet for an inexperienced investor.   What I like the most about the workshop was the approachability of both speakers (though Ky favourite of the two is Rusmin for his stories) ;)   I would recommend the workshop to my friends.
5,"Investment challenge for me was controlling the emotions. I will try to implement what I learnt to control my emotions.  Online class is interactive and fun to learn.  Yes, I recommend dividend machines."
4,It is a useful course... 8 steps gives a concrete framework to procuring stocks. I had hoped for more worked examples for us to build confidence in the steps explained.
5,Good course that's well worth the cost.  Learnt about portfolio planning and how to generate sustainable passive income.  Highly recommended to people who wants to generate their own passive income
5,It‚Äôs a must attend course for newbie. teaches the fundamentals to investing and lowering your risk.
3,"One of my most used card for general spend and overseas spend. However, you need a lot of patience to deal with the telephone hotline support..."
4,One of the highest earning miles card for oversea and local use for a regular card. However so far do not has any any promotion.
3,"Singtel's network is no doubt one of the best in Singapore, but its inflexible plans are difficult to deal with. Even with the new initiatives, it seem to pale in comparison with giga and circles."
4,"Price isn't everything. Service reliability is.  I've been a Singtel customer for years.. I switched to M1 for 2 years as M1 was cheaper, but I switched back to Singtel once my 2 year contract was up.  Why?  There's no point in having lower prices if you can't get service when you need it.  There was no service on M1 along the North-East Line back then, especially between certain stations. I could only look in envy at the Singtel compatriots while I sulk in defeat during my daily commute to work.  Singtel is more expensive. It doesn't have 100% coverage. But it works when you need it, and that's all I need from it."
5,Singtel has great network connectivity! Customer service has always been pretty good and I appreciate when they try to understand customer difficulties. 
1,"I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm done with Singtel. Their contract plans were incredibly expensive and really easy to exceed as well. While I can see some recent effort in improving their data offerings, it still pales in comparison to the major competition out there. Sorry Singtel, you were my first but our journey ends now. "
4,"Hello All. I pay $37.31 every month for SingTel's Combo 2 Plan (CIS Promo). I am satisfied with its service in terms of connectivity. I do not face any issues when using the internet at home or in public places. The speed is fast as well.  That said, I've seen better deals and will change to a cheaper plan with a decent connection."
4,"Been with SingTel since day one. Though their service is not perfect, they have a reasonable level of customer service. Especially for the times that I had issues with billing and service.   It will be great if they can re-look into their bundles plans. I strongly believe they will be able to update the bundles plans to entice and retain customers.   Based on current services:  Internet:Fast and relatively stable MioTV: Expensive and not many interesting channels Handphone:SingTel circle is good but bundles service can be much better "
5,I‚Äôve been using Singtel mobile with data x 3 and mobileshare with my husband. It‚Äôs a really good deal as I mainly use wifi at home and in my office. I feel that Singtel coverage is still better than other service providers especially in more ‚Äòulu‚Äô places or on the MRT underground.
3,"I am using the family bundle plan, so this means that the Internet, TV and home telephone services of my parents‚Äô house and my house as well as two mobile subscriptions are lumped together under one fee. It‚Äôs hassle-free for me to keep track of this expenditure.  SingTel‚Äôs recent tie-up with AIA also means that we can walk 10,000 steps every day to gain enough points towards 1GB of free data. I like how I‚Äôm made conscious of my walking habits without wearing a tracker.  What does get on my nerves sometimes is SingTel staff calling me to persuade me to switch plans and/or take on new deals. Now I‚Äôm as desperate for a good deal as the typical Singaporean, but having these telemarketers hard-sell me stuff at a rapid-fire speed is off-putting. I hope they do more of the promoting through the MySingTel app. "
1,"I have decided to switch over to circles life yesterday with promo 8gb $28/mth after comparing my experiences with these telco + price point. I am data heavy but I connects automatically to free wifi pretty much in malls and home so every month I don't exceed 3gb (though I could since my plan is 4gb). Usually uses WhatsApp calls but occasionally still have to do normal calls for reservations etc.  SINGTEL:  Pros: 10gb/mth @ $36.05 (+2gb if switch to ST on SIM only now) comes with 150mins talk time + 500 free local SMS. Free ST wifi across Singapore if you're ST postpaid customer.  Cons: Bad service both at counter and call operator level. I was just changing my phone 6 weeks ago at ST; made appt online but got confusing SMS from ST, called them back and operator told me my collection point is at Jurong when I clearly selected AMK. After arriving at AMK I was made to wait an hour plus for nothing and no service recovery. Also, when you are tied to contract with ST they do not auto upgrade you to be on par with their new packages. Example you registered for 4gb (4g network) @ $65/mth 2 years back; even if new package is $40/mth you'll be charged at $65 even after your contract is over. Also, when I sign up for 4g network I will want 4g network say 80% of the time. Not 3g. ST cheated my feelings.  STARHUB  Pros: 6gb + unlimited weekend data @ $24 (12 mth contract) and if you're overseas you can simply turn on dataroam @ $15 for 2gb (valid 1 mth) so it's really convenient.  They also used to upgrade existing users FOC to new package so long as you're not under contract. If you were paying $65/mth for 4gb, you may notice you have 6gb because they upgraded you. They will send you a letter to inform you and this is what I like them. Don't think they are doing now though.  Cons: Technical glitches. Past 3 months I've been experiencing constant glitches from them. First I had data roam which I used in Taiwan which was okay but when I go to Malaysia the next week it couldn't connect at all. I called in to verify and all was verified ok so I entered Malaysia again the next week and again no signal. Called operator again and was told it is an IT glitch which they are trying to solve (2 weeks at least - really?) Also let's not forget their massive breakdown just last week. My phone is on SH postpaid and my home wireless is SH too. So if there's totally no signal; it's not just cable and fibre broadband issues. Their technical team needs to buck up.  Zerox:  Pros: unlimited everything for first 3000 sign ups at only $65/mth.  Cons: Not for everyone. Do you really need unlimited everything when you can get wireless pretty much everywhere now and cheaper plan @ $30 and below?  Circles life:  Pros: 8gb for $28/mth no contract and comes with 100 min talk time... Unlimited WhatsApp free and deliver the constant 4G promise. I stay and live in town but often goes around to East, North and West of SG. While I always get 3G signal in Orchard for ST & SH, circles life gave me 4G. I did a free trial with circles life last year and it certainly surprises me. Let's not forget free roaming and free caller number display which ST & SH charges for basic necessities.  Cons: No SMS but not a big deal because to be honest you can contact everyone on WhatsApp/line pretty much these days.  Sorry for the long post but this is why I chose circles life! Hopefully circles life stays competitive in terms of both pricing and service level so I can support them on a continuous basis."
1,I‚Äôve requested my termination notice via the customer chat box and it told me to ‚ÄúPlease leave us your number and our customer service agent will call me shortly‚Äù.   It‚Äôs been 6 months.
3,I been with SINGTEL for a long time.   Pros 1) good island wide coverage  2) bundle circles provides discount and Sunday free data   Cons  1) no free caller ID  2) low data bundled with plans  3) pricy   I think it would be better to go with Sim only plans 
5,"Hi everyone. I'm subscribed to SingTel's Combo 2 Plan. It's good for light internet users like myself. When I read news online, the speed is fast. Regardless of where I am, I don't encounter any connection problems. 2GB is sufficient as I've home broadband."
1,"Switched to Circles about 7 months ago and I absolutely love it! Was under a Singtel contract previously because of family perks. However, exceeding my meek 3GB data limit became a monthly ""ritual"" I would say. Even though Singtel offers me unlimited sms, most people in this age of technology uses Whatsapp/Telegram/Line as a platform for communication. This perk wasn't a perk for me at all. Now, with Circles, I can get up to 6.5GB at less than $30 as compared to Singtel which stands at $60 (assuming that I exceed 3GB)! Being a student who pays her own phone bills, that $30 saved every month makes a whole lot of difference!"
5,"Coverage wise it hasnt failed me so far, the app is easy to navigate to select roaming plans, More practical if the whole family is on Singtel to benefit from the discounts. Also helps if you're on singtel circle"
4,"Have been a Singtel Mobile user for the past 8 years since porting over from M1. Currently on the SIM-only plan.   Ultimately a telco should provide reliable connectivity at a reasonable price, and Singtel for me has delivered on the above. Roaming rates are reasonable, app works fine to subscribe for/cancel value-added services, strong connectivity in most of Asia while roaming. As an occasional business traveler I would gladly pay a slight premium to stay contactable and take voice and data calls without having to worry about call quality.   It is also worth noting that my plan was automatically upgraded from 6GB to 20GB of data per month without an accompanying snarky emailer telling me how ""in the know"" I now am (said notification came via SMS with just the info I needed - how much data I now have, effective date, expiry date).   The incumbent telcos get a lot of hate and vitriol for poor customer service, inflexibility, hidden charges and the like; while this is true to some extent, it is not entirely fair to expect a large, listed organization to be as frivolous with subsidizing prices for consumers, placating every unhappy customer with freebies, and coming up with edgy, controversial, ""viral"" marketing campaigns to look cool.  Singtel doesn't have the bells and whistles and definitely isn't branded as well as the new guys, but if I wanted to be with the ""in"" crowd, switching telco providers would frankly rank pretty low on the list."
4,"Been with Singtel for over 20 years. Connectivity is great. Their service is excellent too. However, prices and additional data/service charges are pretty high as compared to the new telcos. Therefore, 4/5 stars!"
1,"Do NOT get Singtel they simply steal your money. I had overpaid my bill and I called Singtel 2 months before I was moving out of Singapore to ask them to return my extra money. They said that they would mail me a check in 4 weeks. I never got the check. After 4 weeks I called them multiple times to ask about the status of the check. Every time they said that someone would look into it and then contact me but no one ever did. Finally, 3 days before I was to leave SIngapore, I called again. The guy I talked to said they could rush a check to the store and I could pick it up from the store in 2 days. He even made me email my flight details to him so that he had proof that I needed the check to be rushed. He said they would call me when the check was ready to pick up. Surprise, surprise, no one called me. I called again that day and they told me to rush to the store because it was closing in an hour. I asked him to call ahead to the store and let them know I am on my way. I get to the store and surprise, surprise, the guy did not call ahead and they have and no idea what I am talking about. They also do not have a check for me and cannot write one. Someone asked for my bank account information and says that they will direct deposit the money into my account in 3-4 weeks. Well, it has been 4 weeks, and I still have not received my money.  Singtel is really great at making sure that you pay your bills on time but they currently owe me OVER $300 AND HAVE NOT PAID ME IN 3 MONTHS. They are scam artists and you should NOT trust them with your money or your business. "
1,"It has the best coverage for phone connection no doubt.   This must be the worst ever telco to be with. -Poor Customer Service -Bad Reputation -Pure Monopoly -Poor Response time -Expensive price plans -Low data plans, expensive top-ups -Forcing consumers to do take their plans -Poor Shareholder value"
5,"Best coverage among the 3 telcos. i had m1, starhub and singtel for various stages in my life. singtel definitely has the best coverage overall."
5,"Switched my mum's Singtel line (Combo plan) over to Circles.Life's flexi plan (SIM-only) when her contract was up since her usage is very low. As a result, managed to save about $40+ every month since the flexi plan offered by Circles is free of charge with no strings attached. Understand that there is now a registration fee of $50, but I managed to get this plan when it was first launched and it didn't have any registration nor delivery fee. Super value for money! "
2,"I had been with Singtel for almost 3 decade. My present plan is Combo 2.  In the past, there had been different type of categories name plan, that not Combo type, and was use to be invited to special offer upon nearing to ending of my contract of 2 years' period as being a loyal customer, the offer was always better then the new sign up. For the past few rounds of new upgrade, I did not get any invites for a attractive offer anymore. As competition stiffened in the past months with more Telco poping out, prices are getting cheaper, while I am still stuck with the plan at high price. Few more months left to the end my contract of 2 years, I requested to switch to lower plan that cost half what I am paying for with even better talk time and data features, but need to pay quite a hefty penalties for that matter. So much for being loyal customer, I am planning to switch Telco."
5,"APPLICATION?  Application process via online is seamless and  easy.   ADDITIONAL SIM? Thinking of getting additional sim for work related or for someone else? In addition, for Combo 23at only $68.90/monthly, you‚Äôre entitled to 3GB data and with Data X3 at $9.90/month, nothing to worry about bursting the limits. In additional, Singtel gives 24 months of free Entertainment Plus. Singtel also has their personal app that encourages everyone to clock 10,000 steps per day to unlock reward which entitles upto 3GB data redemption per month.   CONNECTION STRENGTH? Undoubtedly, this telco connection impressed me. Whilst travelling regardless of in tunnel or at camp sites, there isn‚Äôt a significant drop in the connection signal as compared to my previous telco (not pointing fingers). Blackshot mobile definitely require good connection signal at all times. "
5,"I have been using Singtel mobile and fixed line for many years. Singtel mobile has a wide coverage area which i am not worried about line dropping. I also login to wireless sg free wifi line whenever I can, in McDonalds, libraries and some MRT stations. Good to have Singtel Line"
4,Good value price when I signed up for corporate plan. Good network and island wide coverage. Easy to navigate mysingtel app.
5,Usually don‚Äôt encounter any major issues with my singtel mobile line or fibre broadband service which i appreciate for many years. Hope this continues and will be great if singtel can offer more perks and rewards to loyal singtel users. 
4,"Being the biggest and the oldest and the you know what reasons, people tends to set a much higher expectation and more unforgiving towards Singtel.  I don't think I need to say much on what types of plan and package they offer, all these information can be found on their web site. Instead I will wish to share my personal experience with them.  I've the mobile Combo 6 plan, 3 x mobile share plans, 1GB fibre plan and Singtel TV plan with them. This qualify me as their circle member which allow me to upgrade my mobile every 12 months and free data on Sunday,    I also have this UOB-Singtel Visa card and Singtel Dash. I top up my Singtel Dash with my Singtel bill which qualifies  me as prestige customer that gives me $240 SingtelShop voucher every year.   I charge my Singtel bill to UOB-Singtel Visa which earn me $10 cash rebate every month.  On and off they do have some lucky draws, in my memory I have won 4 ticket to Kidzania, log cake and mooncakes from some hotels over the years. I must say that I am not a very lucky person who has never won any 4D nor Toto in my lifetime.  One on one, obviously Singtel won't be the cheapest and they do offer very good overall package if you know how to utilise it.  As for the technical issue, there was only two occasions that I recall in which I need to call the hotline in my more than 10 years with Singtel. Once I forgot to turn off data roaming when I go oversea and incurred $20+ data roaming, I managed to call in to waiver it successful.  Another occasion was my Fiber modem not able to power up. I was advised to bring it down to one of their service centre to have it exchanged.  I have not performed any in depth study and research of all the telco but generally I am still quite satisfy with Singtel and have no intention of changing it in the near future."
3,"I had been using Singtel since 10 years ago. To me, I find the pros side for using Singtel are if you using Singtel Dash to pay your Singtel Bill you get free 1 gb, and corporate plan can hit 40% discount on your monthly bill. The con side, I found Singtel signal very unstable. Especially nearby Singapore custom and in MRT. I always get H+ out of sudden, no idea why. "
5,"I am using the SingTel Mobile No. from last 8 yrs. and it was an awesome experience with Telco Service, Customer Team & smooth contract renewal process. Also, they provides excellent promo options for overseas roaming and data. Overall my experience with Singtel is very good & do prefer it to my friends and relatives."
1,"My Google play account was hacked and Singtel allows it to charge google play items to be deducted from my bill without my consent, without any verification or notifications. The accumulated bill was $200+, I only knew it when i received my bill. Not a single sms/email was sent to me to notify this.   I called Singtel CS hotline, spoken to Naren, all I heard is company SOP and they can't help me at all, ask me to contact Google play to resolve this. And also told me that I'm the one who authorized it to be charged to my Singtel bill, if I change it to pay by credit card, if my credit card has been hack, I also can not be finding the credit card company to resolve this issue right, bla bla bla. Told me change it to pay by  my credit card instead, so it will not charged to my Singtel bill. Does it make a different for me to change to different payment matter? First of all, if I knew this would happened to Singtel, I will not use Singtel at all right.  In the first place, Why do you all allow it to charge without notifying the customer? If Singtel won't take the responsibility, why take them as the vendors?  Using Singtel for 10 years+ it really such a disappointment and feel insulted in what CS response, hate it that I now tied with Singtel contract and can't cancel it. When things happened, Singtel just push the problems away, instead of helping the customer, but monthly just sit there collect our money."
1,"High pricing and low customer service. Over charge on my bills... Call CS to check, they will ask you to hold the call & check....and it take me 35 min for they to check...  Switch all my 3 numbers to M1 and StarHub. Will not come back to SingTel again... "
1,"""We strongly encourage you to settle the payment within seven days from the date of this letter (Nov 30)"" - I received said mail on the Dec 8. Buck up with your mailing before you threaten people, Singtel. >Switched to Circles Life because of: - Poor customer service - Expensive plans with no rewards - Shitty connection - Extra charges I could go on. Just get a new telco."
1,higher price but a lot of extra hiding charges in bills.   Unless you check the bill in detail every month you might not have observed.
2,Their connection-wise is poor if you stay at higher storey. The only good about them would be their student and NSF mobile plans. Its affordable.
4,"Switched over to sim-only plan a few months ago from combo 2, now paying $20 a month. Switched mainly because of the price for 5GB data. Didn‚Äôt know $20 was excluding Caller ID until when I was at the store. Went ahead anyway and didn‚Äôt get Caller ID which is an additional $5 each month..  Reception and connectivity generally no problems. But, not sure if it‚Äôs my phone (iPhone X) but I‚Äôve experienced 4G connection issues sometimes in the mrt.   Was told that 5GB is a promo that only lasts one year, after that it becomes 3GB for the same price. Planning to switch plans once the promo is over."
3,"Pretty much on Singtel my whole life, since school days. Initially on their contract plan and recently swapped over to their SIM Only plan. Mixed feelings.  Good: - The Singtel app is a good feature. Allows me to track everything quite easily and pay bills. - Customer service is getting better these days and they are very open to suggestions.  Cons: - I have issues getting a connection on Train (Mainly underground stations and also Yio Chu Kang to Ang Mo Kio section).  - Connectivity hasn't been very stable. There are places with good connection previously, not receiving as well. - Singtel Wifi not really useful.   Not sure about the other telcos, and didn't want to take the risk of changing telco away from the biggest telco in Singapore. Am actually trying out  Circles.life to check out the connectivity at the same time.  "
4,Singtel has great network connectivity! Customer service has always been pretty good and I appreciate when they try to understand customer difficulties
4,Superb reception island wide. Ability to top up dash account with my bills and pay with dash to receive extra 1GB data for free is a wonderful bonus
3,The line is good but the plan is slight expensive as compare to Circle. Hope to see more improvement from SingTel. 
5,have been subscribing to Singtel for quite a long time.  renewal is also very prompt and service customer staff I very helpful
5,"Their connection is reliable most of the times and their apps are easy to use. They have a variety of plans to choose from, so overall a good option."
5,"The signal is good and the phones are cheap! Should always sign up with a corporate plan. When i first came to sg and work and intended to sign up a plan, the customer service officer served me with patience and guided me on what are the documents required to sign up for the plan. Really appreciate the staff at Jurong point "
5,good service  very helpful and easy to use for me value for money. Highly recommended ...............
5,Love to use SingTel plan! Fast! Stable! Convenient! The plan is wonderful! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Have being using SingTel for many years!
3,I was once a singtel user however switched over as the plans are generally very pricy compared to their competitors.
4,"Sometimes I don‚Äôt get connection, not even the SingTel at the top left bar and I thought my line got cut off. "
4,It‚Äôs not bad the service. Will recommend to my friends and my family and relatives. Maybe y‚Äôall can try next time 
4,"The internet connection is reliable and customer service is great! However, the plans can be quite expensive and inflexible."
4,"I‚Äôm on combo 3 CIS, it‚Äôs quite good to use, but the data is very limited with 7GB, hope this can be improved."
3,Sometime the internet connection is really bad.  The mobile data plan is consider expensive if compare with circle line or other network operator. 
5,I'm on the unlimited minutes plan with 3 X data and I've never had any big issues with Singtel at all. In fact they've been pretty nice with billing recently as well as I've missed payments from time to time. 
5,"Coverage is definitely better than the other 2 telcos. We live along the east coast, and when I was with Starhub and left roaming on, I used to get roaming charges. When roaming was off, I would lose connection sometimes. No such issues with Singtel, so while it's pricier, I definitely recommend it for its stability!"
2,Customer service is one of the worst in the market. Always give empty promises and does not give proper resolution to the problem
4,"Overall, coverage wise I think nothing beats Singtel. The price point however is probably the highest among all Telco's due to this. Service wise so far I have not been disappointed. When I need clarification or help, I always opt to use the Callback request instead of going over the counters, chat or calling them. Saves a lot of time.  Package wise, the best value for money at Singtel would be the SIM only plan. If you are not a huge data consumer, they planscan be relatively reasonable. However if you need large monthly data quota's there are MVNO's like Circles and M1 offering similar SIM Only customizable plans at lower rates."
1,"I have been using since 1996, (to-date 23 Years). Initially using only the landline phone connections was good, by the time adding mobile, Dial-up internet, broadband, TV, etc their service quality dropped gradually so badly"
3,Never encountered any issues with Singtel but I have heard of unpleasant stories from my siblings/friends who had their line randomly  deactivated for no reason and it took them a day to reactivate the line. No compensation or waiving of 1 day's bill was given.  Price wise it's more expensive than the newer telecoms.  Connection wise it's pretty good. Haven't tried the other telecoms but I have the impression that Singtel's 4G is pretty solid.  All in all a pretty average experience. Most likely will switch to another telecom if the price is better and the 4G quality is close enough
4,so far so good and no complaints with the network coverage and service since last 4 years. Price could be higher compared to the new entrants in the market but these could be gimmicks offered to gain market share but no guarantee of reliable quality service
5,Have been years with Singtel. It has very good coverage and signal strength compared to other providers. CIS plan provided good discount.
3,"Not happy with upgrade and downgrade fees,ok with the other network and features provided and stability"
4,"I am currently on combo3 and the costs may not be the cheapest compared to the others. But i do get very stable network and this is very important for me. Morever, i enjoy free singtel wifi at alot of public places."
4,"Singtel is the leading Telecom company in Singapore. They have excellent customer service as compared to others and they have a great app to track usages and manage add-ons. Though their pricings are steeper, I can say their network is the most stable even in underground train rides.  I'm currently a 5 years old Singtel's Subscriber using Singtel TV, Fibre Broadband, Postpaid Mobile X 2 and also Geneco which is a partnership between Singtel and the Open Electricity Market, and will continue to be one in the years to come."
1,Ridiculous charges and customer service. I have been with them for 4 months since moving to Singapore and every month I have had 1 or another problem with them. I signed up for roaming as I had work travels and called to clarify the charges and they told me I will not be charged as calls and data will be included in the roaming plan. Now I have a $988 bill with charges for making calls while roaming. Everytime I call to clarify why they failed to provide me the information to not let this happen they say they cant help me and that I just have to pay the bill. Absolutely useless. Definitely switching providers this month. I am amazed they get away with this nonsense.
1,Who is the one who gave 5 stars? It must have been a staff. If there is 0 stars to give I would gladly review that. Singtel has never looked after consumers interest first. It always has been shareholder interests so anything but ST.   Up your game and service man. You dont deserve to be the biggest and most demanded telco of all time. You are simply here because of legacy and past customers. This is all about to change with competition.
4,"GOMO is one of the better plan released by Singtel recently, everyone should take a look at it. Flat rate no frills contract free plan is the way to go."
1,Need lots of improvement if not will keep losing customers.   Horrible customer service . The worst Telco.   
2,"Recalled when I called for change of modem and optic fibre services, it took quite long, customer service process was disorganised, hope to see improvements in this aspect of customer directory."
2,recontracted for years but no promotion given for repeated customers. the most $50 voucher and the data bundle plan is so expensive compared to many. i hope to change after this contract ends. connection can be really bad at times too
3,"Normal service, sometimes the data service is unstable. Customer service is alright most of the time"
2,"Hmm... Mixed feelings I would say. 'Though I enjoy the connectivity that Singtel provides, I am extremely fearful at the thought of their customer service. I find myself praying hard nothing goes wrong during my bond with Singtel so I don't have to go through the torturous process just to get hold of their customer service personnel. Customer service is definitely an area Singtel still have a long way to work on, from salesperson's attitude in the shop to their customer service hotline, I can only sigh at the thought of it. Nevertheless, their mobile connectivity is still pretty stable to me, home broadband services... it's pretty alright. "
3,"Not too bad, been using it for many years now. I know that I'm being charged quite a bit but it just seems so much of hassle to even change it.  Had an okay experience when i encountered a crisis. Did not have data roaming purchased and couldn't receive SMS overseas. Could not do SMS OTP to prove account ownership. God, that was a mess."
3,Other operators are coming on so aggressively they would need to step up their game. Its getting harder to contact their operators should you need any assistant. Luckily they do call back after you chose the callback option. 
1,"The customer service is not prompt and when asked about an issue, they kept transferring me around different departments. "
5,"I'm quite surprised when most of the reviews are 1 star. I'm a foreigner and has been tried M1 and Circle Life before, their 4G signal is very bad at my place (Pasir Panjang).  Have been using Singtel postpaid for 1 year, very stable 4G signal, no issue with service or customer service yet."
1,"Our company has to relocate and thus I arrange all the relocation services 2 months prior and they should have sufficient time to complete however their non sorry ass had to delay our broadband service for 3 weeks (imagine suffering without wifi, for a corporate Organization hello? Use your brain before you ask us if it‚Äôs possible to delay for 3 weeks. Imagine singtel office having to delay wifi for 3 weeks. Pls use your brain before you suggest this to us). Fyi since 2 months ago I already selected the date to be 14th and on 13th June they told me it has to delay for 3 weeks. Worse part is they‚Äôre not sorry at all. They just said ‚Äúthere is no choice‚Äù."
1,"Have already paid the bill and yet still claim to have not received. When I want to make second payment via online, don't allow me to. Some more no contact number online and the online chat service have no used in helping when they doesn't respond to the messages"
1,"Order galaxy a 7 online , order was shown successful,  delivery was to sent to popstation on 11 March 00.00 -1159 pm, Didn't receive sms for collection , until I sms , answer was system error , n payment was not made so  ask me to re order or walk in singtel shop to purchase,üò¨ , I get very angry , n sent mutiple sms shown then those details I receive was sucess, but never show payment mode , pay to popstation?!,? I get so fetup n tell them off , then another staff say will inform revelent department , ask me to wait 1 to 3 days ! Singtel is getting bad to worst"
1,"I have been using singtel for a long time but only recently did i notice about their 30 days hot 55 data plans actually last for half a month, & at most 16 days. I am upset with it & have complained. They did not reply. Now i am awaiting for my brother to buy me a new handphone & change service provider instead."
1,rude customer service at singtel vivo city branch. The chinese girl was very unwilling to answer queries
1,"I'm using a Singtel pay as you go sim card. Whilst I was in Thailand, the roaming rates were $2 per minute for calls. One day, some random person from Singapore rang my number. As I knew it was obviously a wrong number, I did not pick up the call, but $2 was deducted from my credit. Then he rang again. I answered just to check it wasn't an emergency but it was indeed a random call, and for this, another $2 was deducted. Upon hanging up, this person rang again, and I did not answer the phone, and yet another $2 was deducted. So $6 was deducted from my credit in under one minute.  I sent Singtel customer service email to report this and ask for my refund. Their automated response email says they will respond within 3-5 working days. I have not received my response after 2 weeks of waiting.   These guys are seriously dirty to be deducting my credit for merely hearing my phone ring.   Moreover, when I purchased this sim card, their promotional sticker says that I'm entitled to 3GB free data allowance. But upon inserting the sim card in my phone, I get an SMS from them stating that it is 1GB free data to be used anytime, and 2GB free data to be used between Midnight to 8am.  Another sign of dirty tactics with their half-hearted promotions and half-truth marketing.  Truly awful and unprofessional business to be operating in this modern age."
1,Guys be carefull before signing up with Singtel. They will take Ur money but never supply the services and then disappear. I am hanging in the waiting loop since 42 minutes just to get my money back for a service they took the money but never delivered
1,"I've always used Singtel because there wasn't any better options and I just went with the flow. But they are so ridiculous, I pay about $90-$150 a month for my telephone fee. And that's only for 10gb of data, (was 7gb but I kept exceeding). Also when I went myanmmar, the minute I landed Singtel started sending me some texts and I'm like oops I need to off my data. But then they charged me $50??? I didn't do a thing at all. And even after I asked to be waived off the excess charges, I still had to pay about $30? And the staff took so so so so long to deal with my issue, cause now you can't reach them by call, got to send texts through the Singtel App and the customer service people don't follow up with you. Terrible!! Can't wait to port over to Circles.life next year. But for now I'm bound by Singtel till March :'("
3,Faithful to Singtel but bad signal at some stations along NEL and they have to have more competitive pricing :/
3,"My family used to be on Singtel and there were additional discounts when the we sign up new lines. but overall the costs added up, and Circles proved to be a better option, even for my parents since we don't need the line to talk much and is pretty reliant on the data portion."
2,"My entire family uses Singtel in the past. We used to be all under my aunt's corporate plan until she left her job. I was on combo 3, with 2xdata ""add-on"" and i still exceed my data for certain months.   Connection: 3.8/5 For the amount i was paying, with the legacy of the company, i have higher expectations on the coverage.  $$$: 1/5 Have since switched to circles life. I had a ease of mind surfing as much as i want using my phone. I used to pay approx $60 for a plan with 6gb data but now, i have 28gb and im paying $48 only.  Service: 0.5/5 Long waiting times to at the store to get a new phone. The 1st occasion singtel made an effort to call: my home broadband plan is ending...to bug my family to recontract with them. The 2nd occasion - when they realized i ported my number over to another telco. =.=""   Perks and privs: 1.5/5 I manage to win a few pairs of movie tickets, admission to Gardens by the Bay Christmas market. Never gotten any perks to recontract (vouchers). Heard from my friends who are with StarHub that they always get vouchers when it is almost time to recontract. For the premium i was paying, i definitely expected more..."
4,"Pre-purchase experience: 2/5. Went down to the Singtel shop and had to wait about 1.5-2hrs before someone attended to my family. Thereafter, service was generally slow till actual purchase but concluded in 0.5hrs and salesman was in the know of the products and plans available so that was good.   Post purchase experience: 4.5/5 No complaints generally. The network is readily available and strong (can sustain phone calls in the lift, while operators like M1 could not, have a work phone and a personal phone running on 2 different networks).   Would choose this over M1 at least from my experience.  "
4,"Switch to SIM-Only plan when I started working.  I used data on transport on daily basis, and 5GB can last me through the month, with surfing of Facebook.   Pros:  -Singtel app has some deals which is only exclusively for Singtel members. -SIM ONLY PLAN (12 mth plan) around $25, with caller-ID, 5GB data(2 GB free for a year) -For me,  I feel that Singtel WIFI works at certain place, but we cannot expect too much from it.(better than no WIFI and have to tap on data :p ) -Tip: Call *3282 for Singtel to send a sms to check your data usage for the month  Cons: -Do  note that the SIM ONLY PLAN only has 3GB without promotion initially. When I did not renew my contract earlier(after a year), they revert my data to 3GB without reminding that my SIM ONLY PLAN is expiring, and charge me higher, when there is a on-going 5GB deal going on for renewal.  Still thinking whether I should switch to Circles.Life for more data...haha  "
3,"Just switched to Singtel from M1 to buy the Google Pixel 2 XL.  Overall, the data and call features work. I stay in the West, so M1 had pretty bad reception, but now Singtel just works (nothing fancy)  I feel their support, communication and transparency can be much better. Previously, I signed up the Singtel Spotify plan thing to link Spotify with Singtel and it took them 2 months to set it up. Called them and went down to the shop several times, but didn't manage to get a clear answer. Also, apparently under the Singtel-Spotify plan, we get to stream songs without consuming data, but even this is not communicated well. How do I know *for sure* my data is not being consumed? Where can I check this?"
3,"I have been on Singtel's corporate plans through my parents since young (so for me, prices have been decent!). I have to say that the service at Singtel shops are rather slow, especially when some things can only be done at the Somerset Main Branch and that is really such a dread. The Singtel App has helped a lot in tracking data, call time etc, but I can't help but think if I should switch over to seemingly more attractive plans that Circles Life etc offer"
4,"I have been on Singtel for the past 10 years :) I first was on the Combo 2 student deal which provided me relatively decent amount of data 2GB... But soon, when I started work, I discovered the SIM ONLY deal (around 1 year ago) Since then, I have decided to switch over to SIM ONLY (12 mth plan) which gets me around 5GB for $25 a month.   Pros: - Pretty much superb network coverage (even in trains, no complaints) - The Singtel app is really good, especially like the feature which allows me to check my data and calling usage without having to log in (just my number will do) Easy to open up and access the self-help options (e.g roaming or additional data) - There is this Singtel family circle which allows me to get free data on Sundays (but I have since canceled it after I swapped to SIM ONLY) as I did not want to pay additional for the phone - Birthday treats! In my birthday month, I get 1GB free! :) and usually, they surprise you with some good deals (F&B etc) also in your birthday month.  Cons: - Singtel wifi doesn't work (in MRTs) which is the whole idea of the +2GB Free Singtel wifi (but nope) - I couldn't troubleshoot myself and the wifi seems to be locked - They will tend to silently charge fees (eg turning on or off additional data) which let me feel very cheated as a consumer  I think as a whole, after doing a ton of calculation. I can get around 8GB of data a month with Circles life for $28 a month which I will now be switching to in the following month! :smile: Thank you Singtel, and hope we meet again someday."
5,"Good card to use for people who frequently purchase clothing and electronic as well as on online merchants such as AliExpress, Amazon, Lazada, Shopee and Taobao."
5,Great card for certain categories without minimum spending to hit per month to enjoy 4 miles per dollar spending. Cap at 12k per year.
4,Applied for this card previously as there was a 2 cards sign-up promotion. I clock most of my purchase on this card and recently just redeemed a $20 NTUC voucher using 7500 points (if i recall correctly). Not looking to use it for accumulating mileage so will just just be doing redemption for cash/vouchers on the OCBC rewards catalogue. 
5,"The rewards rate for $1 = 10 OCBC$ is not only for online. You get 10X points when you shop at retails for babies and children's wear, clothes, bags and shoes, department stores, electronics and gadgets; which cover almost all retails.  Why I think this win against Citibank Rewards is because of its points redemption. I'm a fan of cash redemption using points. Citibank Reward is $10 rebate for 4200 points; while OCBC Reward is $10 rebate for 3600 points. On a long run, you get more rebates :)"
4,"Good miles card for shopping (based on the categories that ocbc has classified ie electronics, babies clothing etc), however note that their 10x ocbc $ (4mpd) is only for merchants that fulfill the correct merchant code. Might require some homework for shops that are not too clear cut if you want to get your bonus (search up forums discussing places that people have used the card at and got their ocbc $).   They are having a promotion of 4mpd for all mobile payments (apple pay, google pay etc) till 31 dec, so might be a good card to get if you are aiming to earn miles. Otherwise, maybe try a more straightforward cash back card that requires less thinking for purchases. "
5,I always use it this card with Samsung pay. My go-to-card for all mobile paywave payments to get 4miles/dollar.
1,Not much benefit for me. I prefer cash back than points. And there‚Äôs some restrictions on retailers which apply for extra bonuses. I was even tired to read the details. The customer service for credit card section is also not really friendly or helpful. Just minimal helpfulness. Hardly use this card unless retailers have some OCBC promotion ongoing. 
5,"Whenever I have chance to use Amex (bad points: not all merchants accept Amex), I‚Äôll defintiely use Amex The rewards are worth the spending, great Lounge at the airport, great vouchers they mail me regularly  on hotels and business class tickets. Lots of restaurants offer great deals too on amex"
3,"Signed-up for the 100k miles bonus, also liked that the application process was pretty much seamless and fast approval time too. Comes with a cool metal card that came with a really unnecessarily fancy box that I don't know what to do with now.   The biggest issue would be the $695 annual membership fee which I find myself unlikely to continue using after the 2nd year. "
3,"Signed up for the card due to the attractive sign up bonus (100k miles with 6k spend) since I'm paying for my wedding banquet. Pretty good to accumulate miles for honeymoon. The metal card is pretty cool too. However, the earn rate is pretty normal. Not too sure if I'll continue using it in future."
4,I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones with the awesome sign up bonus. Basic earn rate considering its high annual fee with basic perks. Might not continue on my 2nd year unless the renewal bonus is great. 
3,Great card for the promotional sign up bonus (but not much else). 1 star for the sign up bonus. 2 stars because the physical card is pretty cool and shiny 
5,"This was an amazing card especially from a promotional sign up miles POV.  I'm planning for my wedding banquet and paying down the deposit and balance now.   100,000 Miles for: - Paying annual fee ($600+) ok this one is on the exorbitant side - Spending $6k in 2 months  I was one of the luckier few who got the X card before they pulled the promo out.  The SCB online user interface and points redemption can definitely be much better though!"
5,enjoy using this card which is widely used in all shopping centers etc. best of all you can accumulate points and redeem vouchers. in addition there are promotional items which can utilized. 
4,"I have personally held this card for the longest among all others. One thing I like is the fact that it is used for CapitaLand malls and they are almost everywhere.  Enjoy dining so I always whack the 10x rewards merchants to accumulate the points faster. Imagine getting close to 6.5% rebates on dining. Not to mention their sign up bonus of $60 rebates in vouchers when you spend $1,500. That's a 4% rebate excluding the points you will earn which will convert into vouchers too!"
3,"Signed up during a carousell promo, cant rmb exactly what i received but it seemed good enough then.   It feels quite good to receive alot of capitastar points when spending w the card, however it's not really worth it to convert points to capitamall vouchers. Other inapp deals are more value for money.  I held the card for one year only. When amex decided to charge me annual fee for second yr and couldn't waive it because my spending wasn't high enough to justify the waiver, i converted it to the true cashback card."
4,"Personally, this is my 2nd credit card and I find the sign up bonus attractive as I received $20 CapitaVouchers (in the form of STAR$) after being referred by my friend. My friend would receive S$30 CapitaVouchers (in the form of STAR$) after referring to me. Besides that, you get to earn STAR$ points when shopping at Capitalmalls."
1,"I had canceled this card as I do not spend much at CapitaMalls, and the rewards are not as attractive as other cards."
2,"A card thats worth it only for the sign up bonus. Subsequently after, it might be good for families that spend most of their time in capitaland mall for the ""free carpark"". Apart from that (If you dont revolve your life around capitaland malls), you could try other cards. Btw, this is the only credit card that can be used to purchase capita vouchers"
1,This card is not a suitable choice for consumers. It's only largely focus on Capita Malls and you the rebates were'nt attractive enough.
1,"The exchange rate of Star$ to vouchers is 5,000 star$ to 5 capitalland voucher. This means you can only get about 1-3% rebates (3% for dining) at capland outlets. This is definitely not good when other cards such as OCBC 360 and BOC family card are aready offering 6% rebate on dining. Its rewards system has to be improved to match other cards.  1 star- only useful for its sign up gift and then set aside"
4,"I have been using DBS Vickers for a few years now. I use the Cash Upfront account to buy my shares, because it offers one of the lowest commission on the market. Using this platform also helps me increase my returns in my DBS Vickers account. However, the trading platform can be improved by updating its looks and functions. Other brokerage accounts offer apps with much better functions and looks."
4,"I have been on DBS Vickers for about 6 months, mainly trading REITs! It‚Äôs been ok. Chose it mainly for the cash upfront $10 min per trade and CDP holding (rather than custodian). Also i‚Äôve been a DBS customer since I was in my mother‚Äôs womb. -.-  Pros: -Easy to use to buy/sell -SMS and Email notifications when trades are filled or expired -Interface is clear and watchlist function works well   Cons: -Damn difficult to login to access for the cash upfront account side -App is kind of non-existent (doesn‚Äôt work with cash upfront, unless I‚Äôm missing something here) haha -Onboarding was really tiresome and I had to open up and fill multiple forms (guess its the same for many)  Been thinking to switch to FSM also, after doing a lot of research on the mobile app, web interface and also the fees which are considerably low. Anybody with advice and feedback from FSM ONE? :)"
4,"I opened my Vickers online trading account recently. It was very convenient to open it using iBanking since I already have a Multiplier account and a CDP account.  My first 3 trades are free as part of the account opening promotion.   However I'm not very sure about the customer service as they were not very speedy when I emailed them.  Also, the app doesn't have the option for cash upfront, but I realised I could just use my mobile browser to make cash upfront trades.  Overall, there is a lot of room for improvement but I'm still a satisfied customer."
3,"Use DBSV for the easy access to ibanking on DBS/POSB. New comers to this landscape and find the website hard to use, not welcoming for newcomers and hard to understand each terms and what it does. Called CSO and find their service ok. If only they could make it more user friendly with lots of tool tips to explain the usage and features of each items / selections.   On boarding is also a pain, had to fill up at least 10 to 15 pages and forms and agreement here and there... such a pain ..  Hope the future of trading using the platform can be easier as I learn more and hope more guides about how to on the tools can be make available. "
1,This is probably the worst app i‚Äôve used. The poor UI/UX on both mobile and web gives me anxiety about using the platform. I had issues such as not being able to view my SG Stocks and had constant difficulty getting through to its customer service. The only small advantage it has is that it is linked to your DBS account. I won‚Äôt recommended anyone to use this.
4,Been using DBS Vickers for years now. Only used cash upfront to trade.  Pros: Cheapest in terms of cash upfront Stocks bought using cash upfront is credited into your personal cdp Notifies me about my orders getting filled  Cons: User experience can be improved on the platform More rooms for improvement should they wish to encourage newbies to trade.
1,"The worst experience with their call center trash. Extremely unprofessional. It was my first time calling to enquire about a stock I've ordered, and he answered ""how many times I need to tell you?"" WTF  After only using this service for 2+ months, and spending a bulk of my savings, I'm cancelling my account immediately. "
4,"Been using DBS Vickers as my local broker.   + Easy to use interface + It links to my DBS multiplier account hence every month when I make a trade, it will be counted as a fulfilment to the ""investment"" requirement to qualify for higher interest rate for my DBS Multiplier account.  + Allows you to preview your trades along with the fees before you confirm your trade  - App is totally not usable. Cant manage to log in despite multiple attempt. - Fees are competitive to other local brokers but higher than custodian brokers such as Saxo (which i use for my overseas stocks)  Overall 4/5!"
3,"Main advantage over SCB is your local (SG) shares are held by SGX CDP (sense of security). However the brokerage fees are high as the various brokerage firms benchmark against each other. Am not brave enough to use brokers without brick n mortar set-ups like IB (just up and disappear anytime?).  Brokerage fees are especially expensive for trading of foreign shares, as no cash upfront option. Cash upfront also not available for joint accounts, which is disappointing as couples may want to build their nest egg together.  Agree that customer service can be improved. They hire a bare minimum of headcount, presumably to keep costs low. But with enough perseverance from the customer you can eventually get everything set up n figured out."
2,"I trade mostly shares listed in US, HK and Singapore. Settlement in USD and HKD is a big problem. I have to go down to the branch, queue for an hour at teller at DBS, then the fund take 2 working days to received. Same thing when Vickers transfer to DBS account. Also have to Queue and take 2 days to receive the fund. I understand the Vickers's  usd or HKd  acccount with DBS.  The problem is obvious but no one is solving the issue. The digibank doesnt work too. Very frustrating.."
4,"Vickers is generally unfavoured compared to SCB's lower rates, but there are some advantages: - Easy integration with DBS bank accounts - Cash upfront provides low rates for local trades - Decent number of promotions and rebates for active traders - Access to certain exchanges (for example: TSX and US OTC) that the rest don't - Seamless sign up and 24H customer service - So far got free 4X movie tickets to an exclusive screening and buffet for selected traders (guess I've used/paid them a lot) before...was nice!"
3,"Pros: - Competitive Rates - Linked to DBS accounts  Cons: - Poor customer service - Horrendous UI for mobile app  I have switched from DBS Vickers to DBS Wealth Management, which is much much better. There is also no minimum commissions for trades, and there is access to many international markets but with the accompanying custodian fees."
4,"Using DBS Vickers Securities as it charges lower commission fees with cash upfront option. However, cash upfront option is not available on apps. "
3,"The commissions are competitive (Unfortunately, it is high across all banks in SG) and customer support is good. I chose DBSV over other brokerages only because of the integration into DBS iBanking, which makes it easy to review my portfolio, use GIRO for seamless payments.  The thing which bugs me the most is the horrendous DBSV mobile app. The UX is horrible, difficult to use and many of the features on the desktop site are not present. I fail to understand how the same bank can have two contrasting apps - iBanking (unbelievably good) and DBSV (unbelievably bad)."
3,"I find the commission fees payable are considerably low compared to other brokers (but it seems that many are catching up by being on par with one another). The user interface for DBSV is pleasant and easy to use. However, they do not reflect or give a gauge on how well is your portfolio doing.   I am using a cash-upfront account with DBSV. Accessing DBSV can be a hassle with me being required to login via DBS ibanking in order to access DBSV.  Would have scored more starts if they reflect my total holdings and portfolio performance! :("

5,"Great course for beginners! I was a bit apprehensive in learning trading and chart reading, but Collin and his team made it simple to understand. Most importantly, the course, the coaching sessions, support from the FB community as well as the weekly webinars allows me to execute real trades in a very short span of time. Simple, executable trading methodology. Defn recommend to all, especially beginners! "
5,"There is no trading school for beginners, the TGPS System in the SMT community is managed like a school that gives guidance and supports to its students regularly.  You will find the system is easy to use and importantly, it helps students to manage emotion and stay disciplines."
5,Coaching from experienced & proven master trader. Value for money course suitable for beginner to intermediate level traders. 
5,Easy to use software! Learnt how to screen for good stocks to trade. Collin is a very deidicated trainer and is very patient with all his students. It‚Äôs a lifelong programme and he‚Äôs in it for the Long haul. 
5,"Learnt to interpret and understand the data provided by the charts in TGPS. The skills taught such as scanning to shortlist stocks to trade during the course helped to select good stocks to invest in, be it long positions or short. The processes you learn will help you to be more disciplined  so that you do not pick your stocks at random but based on fundamental and technical analysis. Moreover when you attend the training, you become part of the SMT community where you can post your queries and fellow members contribute their views. There is support and communal learning. "
4,"For Traders who need a method and process to follow instead of using many indicators and gut feel, I highly recommend this course. The team has amazing follow-up and the system is robust...would be good if they did a tad more Fundamentals but seriously in this day when even large and Long time companies can falter. Using more technicals is good practice because timing your trades is equally important!"
5,"Excellent course. This is an investment that is definitely more than worth your money. Great after-course support, with webinars, refreshers, gatherings and sharing by the community.  Definitely the right choice to join the systematic trader community."
5,"A very best place to start with for fresher in trading too. Money management, trading psychology, risk reward ratio and above all exuberance with excellence on training people and commitment towards it. "
5,"I've went through the google route of self learning  and also attended many other trading courses  for a very,  very,  long time  during my NS time and when I'm working for someone else but still end up blowing up a few trading accounts and  burned my savings.  Then I came to know about collin inspiring journey from one of his book launch and other sharing session of how he used his own trading system to trade himself out of a quarter million dollar debt which someone  else incur yet he did not have any bitterness or hate towards him was amazing.  And I told myself that if he can go from -$250,000 to 0 and more, which is no different from being $250,000 richer then it means I still have hope and met his team.  That's when everything clicked and I realised that all this time, I'm just burning time googling and using my hard earned savings to experiment ""free"" resources methodology and those other trading courses which I attended which is way more expensive, the trainers seems to be in Singapore just to scalp my course fee and go back , and there are practically no real after course support or that the trainer attitude is very condescending and mean towards others.   Truth be told , self learning is possible if you have a lot of time as everything is everywhere , information overload is real and most of the time,  they are conflicting so we have risk our savings to test out their methodology.  But attending a course like Collin's SMT course, you can feel in your gut that Collin and his team is very genuine, sincere and probably the nicest people you may have met and not here to make a buck and leave as everything is so organised and systematic and its a real proven system to make him $250k so why not just learn from him and his team was and is still extremely supportive and attentive to needs of their students before, during and most importantly after the course to provided much needed guidance and support whenever we ask for it, tbh, his course is very affordable and value for money.   If you are looking for trading courses,  I highly recommend Collin's SMT course and join the SMT community. I guarantee you won't regret it."

5,"Excellent course that addressess my learning gap in trading. With a few practices, i can confidently master the tgps system with ease. "
5,"Excellent trading course for beginners with great support (additional coaching, weekly webinars, quarterly gatherings etc) after the course. Collin is a caring and patient mentor who is passionate about building a trading community. Will recommend anyone interested in learning about trading to attend the course."
5,Great for those who do not know what to buy or do not have the time to do research. You are good to go with Just a few minutes a day together with the technical knowledge and trade/risk management imparted during class.
5,"The only trading course that you will ever need to attend! Detailed yet simple approach to trading, Collin is a great mentor that continually adds value to his student"
5,"For beginner and intermediate who probably has tried many trading methods, this course and the application software TGPS is by far the easiest to learn and master in stock trading. "
5,Collin's course is very useful and he breaks down trading concepts into easy to understand bite-size pieces with helpful examples. He had a very good team of enthusiastic staff who are around to lend a hand when needed. Good  course with useful insights.
4,"After attending this 2 days course, i feel i have a better sense of direction as in how to select stocks, how to enter a trade and exit the trade in a profitable manner. The GPS system is easy to understand & use.  So that is very useful. Also the trainer and assistants are very helpful in answering the questions in detail. Thanks Colin and Marc."
4,"It is a practical course, easy to follow, yet need to prove it. It is very much better, if the trainer can give more example on asia market such as Singapore n Hong Kong."
5,"Attended again as a refresher.  Very informative and beneficial course.  Colin, Marc and all the staff are very professional and helpful.  This is a one stop location to learn the ropes and equip yourself for the challenges into the trader's world."
4,"This is my first time doing a technical workshop/seminar, overall experience is pretty good. Intensive 2 days course with lots of info, have learnt a lot, still trying to digest the volumes of information in such a short period of time. Will be eager to try out the techniques learn and looking forward to the group sharing and learning together."
4,"TGPS is worth the fee to attend. The trainers are sincere and helpful. Personally, I would recommend the handouts to be more comprehensive or else it is hard for a total beginner (as in first time dealing with investment tools) to catch up. Overall, the course is great and well done. "
4,Attended the 2-day SMT course. Trainers are helpful. Good thing is that there is complimentary coaching after the 2-day course to reinforce what was learnt. Don't expect to be a guru at the end of the 2 days but the assurance is the friendly trainers being accessible for support and guidance thereafter.
5,"Its a Great Worthly course. Detailed explanation n easy use platform. Timing well distributed. Great to have group discussion. Here got coffee tea, snacks. Airconditioned, lunch nearby many eating places. Convenient locations. "
5,I am glad to attend this course. Before this I have zero knowledge on trading. Colin and team very patient answering all my questions.  I can't wait to put into practice what I have learned. Thank  you.
5,"Am a refresher, it seems that the  second time around the lessons became a lot more clearer to me. The additional course notes does help to increase my understanding of the SMT system."
5,"Class is easy to follow, the strategies shared are seemingly simple but elegant enough to be profitable. The weekly webinars is really a lot of effort by the trainer in his ongoing promise to deliver ongoing real life application and education to his students so that is highly valuable. Great commitment from the trainer"
4,A good background info for trading . Got to know the difference between position trading versus swing trading. A lot more to learn and practise. This is only the beginning of the journey.
5,"New to trading, have definitely learnt a lot during the course. Collin is well prepared and ready to help beginners, would like to thank him for his efforts."
4,Good course.  Am new to trading.  This course provides an easy and  systematic approach to trading.  Thanks Collin and team.
5,"Attended SMT Batch 79, came back for my refresher training Batch 84 after few months. This is the next best thing I have done with SMT, this refresher training really helps to reinforce my learnings and affirm my confidence of the SMT strategies.  As usual Collin, Marc, Angelina and the team have been most fabulous in helping us through the learning process. Thank you SMT Team!"
4,"Collin has put together his years of trading experience to develop the Systematic Trader course. It is simple to understand and yet comprehensive. Without the use of technical jargon, names of candlestick and patterns, and complicated charts, he shows how trading stocks could be profitable. With the use of his proprietary software TIF (Trend Impulse Factor) and simple moving averages to indicate favorable exact entries and exits, students could now plan their trades with confidence. His friendly personality and the support of his staff has made attending the course a bliss.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself attending the course. Thank you Collin "
4,Great teaching and get to learn a proper trading system from the trainers Collin and Marc.  Hope to apply the training and get better results from trading.  Thanks
5,Simple and systematic trading approach with risk management to learn and follow for beginners as well as existing traders.  Thanks Collin & Marc!
5,"After attending the 2 day course, i have more confidence in approaching Technical Analysis. Collin and Marc were able to extract the essence of TA and simplify it into digestible and less complex learning. Together with the helpers, the crew has been very helpful, enthusiastic and patient. Thank you for the wonderful learning experience!"
5,"This is the best course I have attended. Collin and Mark are passionate, experienced and knowledgeable.  I am very excited with information learnt and embark on the journey with Collin and the team.  Collin is sincere in imparting new skills and wants us to be successful. Kudos !"
5,"Appreciate and thank you for the refresher course, it is really helpful.  I had a lot of doubts were clarified by Collin and Marc.   There are a lot of investment courses and platforms in the market, if you do not want to spend a lot of times learning TA I highly recommend TGPS.  There are thousands of stock in the market and it helps you to filter out a list, it helps to save times.  Collin shares some valuable market insights during weekly webinar, another values added to the course."
5,"I attended the Batch 82 Systematic Traders course as a refresher. I learn more this time . Should come again and believe me,you learn new things and tips. Thank you"
5,"This is a good course for beginners to understand before performing any trade on their own. It allow me to understand how to screen, evaluate and identify a trend and how to entry, stop loss and exit"
5,"This a great course for beginners and existing traders! After the course you are equipped with the skills to review your own portfolio or start to decide which stocks to buy or sell using this GPS System.  Collin, Marcs and his team made it simple to understand. Easy and  practical to use screening software too!   After the course, will have continue support for the coaching sessions, weekly webinars and support from the FB group. Which is great for continuous learning!  Highly recommend anyone to attend this course! "
3,"A weekend course is too short to learn trading especially for first timers. It is a good appreciation of what trading entails. Even for re-sit, I am still learning new things. Some suggestions for improvement. (1) Perhaps the course can be extended to 2 weekends (2) have more hands-on exercises (3) form discussion groups for class attendees."
4,"I found what I am looking for to learn trading stock and trainers are helpful, passion and patience. This is the best place to learn to trade as continuous support."
4,"It has been a 2 days of intensive learning. The first thing we learnt was that market comes before news. Besides the theory, there are also lots of exercises which helps Collin confirm we really understood. ;-)  "
4,"It was a very conducive environment. It is great they provided a lifetime course like this because some of the teachings are too complicated to grasp within a 2-day course.  Provided webinars, books, and facebook chatgroups to aid in the teachings. "
4,Have traded for about 2 months without much success. This course gives me a simple methodology to follow as I move on in my trading journey. It is simple to understand and there are useful video recordings to revisit some of the concepts taught to reinforce. The pace of the class is just right especially for beginners. I also liked that there is a community of traders that we can interact with after the course. Take note that this course does not touch on fundamentals or technical analysis that much but more on how to use their proven system. Do ask about the follow up costs on the system when you attend the preview session and see if it is comfortable for you. I personally feel it is. 
5,"2 Days course that is well-paced and easy-to-understand training curriculum. The trainers, Colin and Marc are really good at what they do, and give even beginners the confidence to start trading almost immediately. There are also complimentary classes after these 2 days which provide the hand holding needed for all to start. Greatly recommended for anyone who wants to start in their trading journey."
4,"The SMT Course is truly suitable for beginners at trading for additional income or even for long-term career.  There is ample hand-holding, coaching and resources to help people from all different levels of experience and background.  I highly recommend anyone with interest to start trading on their own to pick up this course as an initial investment on this journey to success."
5,Good course for someone who has no experience on trading. Course quite intense but the basic was covered. 
4,This course is simple to understand and the great patience of Collin ensure that everyone in the class learns and remembers the strategy clearly.
5,"Very dedicated trainer, going through every single details of the course. Detailed explanation given to every question given and precise in his explanation with givens examples "
5,Thank you for the Systematic Trader course. I enjoyed the course very much. The approach is vey clear and systematic. I look forward to try out the systematic approach on my own trading.  Thank you so much. I can wait to try out on my own.. :-)
5,Excellent courses with generous mentor and friendly staff. No regret to be here. Cheers for the best to batch 81!
5,Mr Collin Seow is one of the best mentor that we met. Generous sharing of all the pros and cons of trading. Very blessed to be here and we are looking forward to our and everyone success! Thank you guys!
4,Great course for any who aspire to improve their trading skill. It's step by step and easy for any who doesn't has prior trading experience!  Thanks Collin!
5,"It is truly systematic, I should have this tool much earlier, it would have saved me by far more value than the training cost.  Nice environment setup.  Good value . Applicable to other markets not just US and Singapore.  Thanks again to all trainers and staffs, especially Collin and Mark"
5,The course was insightful and cleared up alot of misconceptions i had about trading. it was clear and fairly easy to understand . i will warn however that it is much more tiring than expected even though there are ample breaks inbetween the hours.
3,"All are good review, what about those who cant make it? i wonder what is their side of story. =/ i guess we will never know, if u dare to comment bad thing, u will be remove from the group. =("
4,"Just completed a 2 day TGPS course. Actually this is a refresher for me. Thanks to the dedication of the SMT team,  it was intensive and challenging,  even a second time round. The system is very practical and I certainly hope to improve my trading skill further"
5,"This 2-days course allowed me to have a deeper understanding of the trading market and manage my investment. Thank you for the patient guidance from the team, I‚Äôll recommend more of my friends to join this course."
5,"This is my first TA course.  The TradersGPS app does make trading a lot easier.  However, be mindful the many TA skills taught in the course still needs to apply manually.  Trainers are friendly and knowledgeable."
4,"Thank you for your hard work to teach us like me, i seldom do risk reward calculation,this is my refreshing course.learn more. Thank you again"
4,Very comprehensive and the trainers are very knowledgeable and very supportive. Excellent course. Simple and easy steps to follow. Very suitable for beginners.

5,SMT is a course for people who wants to learn to trade more often in the market and to reap rewards along the way through market up and down. It provides you an easy and well established method to let your investment journey a much pleasant one.
5,The class was very well taught. The course material was simple to understand for entries and exits. Depending on your trading style you decide on which system you want to use. I have yet to test the system in near future!
5,"SMT is a very useful course for beginners. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to consider taking up trading. The TraderGPS tool is very useful and together with the course, have given me new perspective and tools to allow me to trade with confidence. Special thanks to Collin and his team!"
5,Graet wokrshop Very clear and precise presentation. Simple and relevant illustrations. Frequent breaks are good for the mind!  I leanred a lot about how to become good at trading Thank you.
5,I believe the SMT Course is very useful for any new traders to start out in their trading journey as it uses a systematic approach and its own proprietary systemto help users pick out their portfolio. Collin and the other trainers are also very knowledgeable and it can be seen that they are really doing this to impart their experience and skills to the students of their course. Highly recommended.
5,TraderGPS was a very systematic  and can be easily understood by beginners. I highly recommend anyone who wants to learn to trade and be profitable to attend this course by Collin. Two thumps up!!!
5,"Better to take this course and learn the intelligent way of trading than to lose money in the stockmarket without knowing better. Thanks, SMT"
4,Thank you for the Systematic Trader course. I enjoyed the course very much. The approach is vey clear and systematic. I look forward to try out the systematic approach on my own trading.  Thank you so much. I can wait to try out on my own.. :-)
5,"The system is very helpful for us to make decision to select, enter and exit a stock. Thank you for sharing it with us."
5,"TraderGPS presents a mechanical way to trade the best stocks without going into the frustrations of over analysis. It also provides a very good technique to do position trading of a good stock which though boring, let you ride your profit with minimal trading and the need to keep monitoring your position."
4,Trainer is experienced. The two days course shared good techniques and strategies to do TA trading.
4,"Fun course, learnt alot of new stuff to improve and enhance my trading. Collin and team was professional and took the time to answer all the questions raised."
4,The trader gps course you can learn how to use the gps trader. I yet to use yet but I cant wait to use and update my feedback
5,"Trader GPS was a very systematic approach and helps take out a lot of guesswork from trading. Even as a semi-experienced Fx trader myself, going through this couse certainly helped me put into perspective relevant and important factors to consider before placing trades. Highly recommended!"
4,"Tradersgps is a simple easy-to-use tool to screen equities, and provide clear position and swing trading signals."
5,Interesting Systematic Approach in trading.  Course and Platform allow beginners  like me to know when to buy and sell stocks.   Coaching is also included after 2 days of course

5,"Highly recommended course for beginners to learn trading. Syllabus was easy to understand, structured and easy to trade. Of note, the community of students and instructors formed a strong support system for continuous and sustainable learning. Go for it! "
5,Overall a great savings account with minimal effort! Currently 4 months in and happy to see the interest come in steadily every month.
5,"I've always been lazy to switch my salary crediting account, but I recently switched over to DBS Multiplier because they were having a $50 cash reward promotion, and that prompted me to get off my lazy bum. Most of the main perks of DBS Multiplier would have been mentioned above, so I shan't repeat them. My main gripe is that in order to change my salary crediting, I needed proof of account number, and I find that the monthly e-statement takes quite long to generate (~8th to 10th of the next month), so I missed the cutoff period for my employer to change my salary account in the immediate month following my application. Took me 2 months to get the salary in, but after all that everything's fine. One good thing I like about it is that DBS will send you a SMS each month to tell you the bonus interest received and the effective % interest rate, which I think is a nice touch to simplify things for customers :)"
5,Opened this account last year and it is the best decision I made in my finance planning. No min salary nor min spending on credit card. Great starting account for young working adults.  - Just need to use a DBS credit card and use it as your primary EZ-Link to easily unlock the credit card portion. - Just need to set aside $500/mth to invest in SSB for 6 months straight to unlock the investment category.
5,"Good for: -Young working adults who just started working (Low salary credit of $2k) -Low credit spending (those who cannot meet $500 spending) -New or want to start POSB invest-saver -Less than or equal to $50k savings  My strategy to utilised DBS Multiplier Account: -DBS Credit card spend (at least $1)  -DBS visa debit card(10% rebate t&amp;c applies https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/promotion/beepbeepkaching) -POSB invest-saver  Salary credit: $2000  Credit card: $1 Total interests earn: 1.55% ($31/mth)  Salary credit: $2000  Credit card: $1 POSB Invest-Saver: $100 Total interests earn: 1.85% ($38.80/mth)  So effectively, POSB Invest-Saver is commission fee FREE! ($7.80 per month extra to invest) *Only applies for 12mths for POSB Invest-Saver  DBS also took the initiative to set up &quot;The Burrow&quot; Facebook group for those who have a DBS Multiplier account.  The group focus on: - Weekly special deals curated just for The Burrow  - Tips to unlock the full potential of your DBS Multiplier Account - Educational content to help you make better financial decisions and reach your life goals - Occasional contests to test your knowledge and skills   I have attended the events organised by DBS and they do not do any hard selling on their products. Mainly focus on educating the bunnies!"
5,"Hopping over from OCBC 360 account too... No requirement of $500 minimum spend.  Just need 1 credit card transaction, using POSB Everyday card as EZlink or paying of SP service bill. Using DBS Altitude Card as well for travel related bookings to get higher miles.  So far DBS's customer service is efficient and responsive too, thumbs up :)"
1,"DBS Multiplier - Just found the Catch üòë [The Sal + 2 (Credit card spending + Investment) ]:  1) The investment part: Have to open multiplier a/c then only can open the investment a/c to be consider as part of transaction. 2) If you already have investment a/c (eg. POSB invest Saver), then WON""T be consider. 3) Even if you fulfill #1, the higher interest on Multi-saver will only last 12 months from the day you start the investment   The big issue is that most company salary credits to DBS / POSB only and not willing to change to other bank, so many were stuck to DBS / POSB. Yet they play such games.    In the end it seems like for more liquid cash savings, only Singapore Saving Bonds is the available choice, 1 year at 1.55%."
5,"Switched over from ocbc360 to the new dbs multiplier last month. It was a seamless process which took 5mins or less via iBanking.  I think this would be a better savings account for a miles chaser like myself. For me, the multiplier was naturally better since I was already using altitude/wwmc. Uob is out since they excluded all their miles earning cards. My Ocbc 360 tgt with the titanium rewards card was pegged at 1.85% max. The multiplier was 1.85% when my total transaction was below 5k. Which means, thee more I earn/spend, the possibility of  higher interest rate. What's not to love!  Plus,having dividends credited to my Posb account  was considered under the 'invest' category in dbs. Satisfying 2 categories, I could bump my interest rate even higher on certain months with dividends. "
4,Unfortunately I changed job and my salary now pays by cheque so there goes all my benefits in multiplier account üò¢ Otherwise I think it would be great.
5,"Opened the DBS Multiplier account about 3 months ago and I am loving it so far! It is really good & pressure free for me as there is no minimum amount required to hit for the credit salary credit and the credit card spending category! I strongly encourage every working adult to open this account!   I'm looking to unlock one more category for a higher interest rate. Hence, I am considering to purchase the SSB over the next few months."
5,"Recently switched to DBS Multiplier, criteria and benefits seem quite straightforward and easy to understand.  Things I have benefited: - No minimum salary or credit card spending - Able to combine salary from more than one person, if you are an existing joint account holder - Able to combine salary and spending to fulfill condition for bonus interest, is a flexible and fresh idea - Not limited to just one particular bank issued credit card  Tips: - Use the bank &amp; earn summary page on dbs web portal to monitor the interest band you qualify for the month as well as the breakdown - If you're considering crediting salary to this, spend at least a minimum of $1 to hit 2 categories. Personally I charged my SP utility bill to my POSB Everyday Card linked to this to get additional 1% rebate - Join The Burrow Facebook page, they have a thriving community that offers tips and special deals for Multiplier holders. Complete the short survey to get additional $5 welcome gift credited to your account  Enjoy and multiply!"
5,"A simple no hassle high yield account.  The best thing is that there is no minimum spending, so it's fairly easy to fulfil 2 criteria and hit about 2% interest on autopilot.  Personally I just use a dbs card for a small monthly payment, and build a 6 month SSB to fulfil the investment category.   Hope they don't nerf this.  The biggest downside to me is that the bonus interest is only on the first 50k "
4,"Apart from salary crediting, needs to combine with credit card spending or investments to attain higher interest rate. I was not working prior and don't have a credit card or any other categories. Hence, until i get my first credit card with them 3 months later, i only enjoy 0.05% interest. I decided to proceed as they offer a $20 + $80 promotion for opening an account and salary crediting which could cover my interest losses for the first 3 months. The call operator was able to answer my queries and all is smooth for now."
5,"Really good and convenient account to use and to maintain. Best part, good interest rates with no minimum credit spending and SSB dividends."
4,"Plus points - can get the 1.88 % easily if compared to the competitor, OCxx (1.55%), subject to respective banks T&amp;C  - multiplier account allow you to get cash back from your DBS credit card with the min spend of $1.00 only !! - there is a Facebook platform, The Burrow will actively engage the users. Awesome moderators will share various investment and personal finance knowledge.   Shortcomings  - ibanking platform is not as user friendly if compared to OC xx especially I can‚Äôt lock my money for my own goal.  - The balance amount will only be updated on the next days. Bit confusing though  - personally, i always need to Q for DBS/  POSB ATM, while OCxx hardly has Q ü§≠"
4,"Pulled the trigger and switched from OCBC 365 to DBS Multiplier. Easier to earn higher interest rates, especially if you are not a big spender (no min spend required on DBS/POSB credit cards to hit the higher tier interest). Also great that the fall below fee is waived if you're under 29. Active community on Facebook (The Burrow) with great support, frequent good deals and promotions.  In short, this is an almost* perfect account with the combined attributes of fixed-deposit interest rates and liquidity of a savings account.  * cos interest is limited to only the first S$50k balance."
4,"Good and hassle free interest. Can still use as main acc even if you plan to change credit cards in future to other banks.   Only complaint is I wish eligible balance for bonus interest went up to 75k like other banks, although that‚Äôs too much to be kept sitting around. "
5,"Very good savings account.  No minimum spend required. Only need to hit transactions in a minimum of 2 categories, salary compulsory and an optional category such as credit card spend, investment, loan etc  The more the transaction amount the more interest you get. So if someone salary is alot, just spend $1 on credit card, the interest will be big big!  Downside is that the bonus interest crediting is abit delayed, about 7 days after the end of month. The summary chart in DBS ibanking is also not real time, you won't know in real time what the estimated interest you will get. "
4,"Applied for the DBS multiplier a few months back and imo, its criteria are more fuss-free because it goes by your overall sum for the categories. This is very unlike other banks, where they put a minimum spending or minimum sum/quantity per category, making it more time-consuming for us to plan in order to maximise the interest.  It would be great if DBS Multiplier can increase its cap, to say $70k or so, like UOB One!"
4,"Been on DBS Multiplier for a month (haven‚Äôt receive my first bonus interest yet). Will review more on the setting up process.  The application is easy, just have to login to your usual DBS account and apply through there. The account got created in a few working days. However, the credit card process took awhile (around 1-2 weeks).  Bonus: use the Live Fresh card and enjoy 10% cashback for the first 6 months (min spend is $600)! Also stack with the spend requirement to earn 1.85% on Multiplier!"
5,My all star Favourite bank account as the requirements are easy to meet (simple spend any amount on their credit card). I find it hard to meet the $500 min spending for most banks' credit cards so this account really works for me! Their interest rates are also rather high! Say hello to free money easily every month!!
4,"Generally satisfied with the account. Sign-up is hassle-free and execution is easy.  For previous MySavings acct, I have also transferred to this account."
5,"Was with OCBC360 until DBS multiplier changed their interest rates.   The current rates are definitely higher than what OCBC 360 offers. Easy to use and if you join the Facebook group (closed group: The Burrow), you get lots of tips and information on how to maximise savings / earnings / spendings. Plus it seems like DBS has a lot of credit card or app promotions going on every month, so being with DBS right now really does give you lots of benefits."
3,Overall the account is quite good with multiplier effect. But the interest is still losing OCBC bank 360 account.
4,One of the most competitive salary crediting account in the market. Few criteria to earn 1.85% which is quite good! 
4,"The internet banking is convenient for all, but the digibank does not enable us to pay the outstanding balance for the loan that we take."
5,A great account for anyone who are taking their first step into the workforce with no minimum salary crediting or credit card spending needed. It also provides additional interest for if you are paying your home loans instalments with DBS/POSB. A suitable account for anyone.
5,Many atms provided n very convenient. Many branches available also. Great service when you go into the bank and they will recommend investment to you.
5,Useful when combined with Singapore savings bonds to hit the higher interest tier. Process for opening the bank account was fast
2,"I personally like multiplier account but there are some reasons why I believe it is only 2 stars now:  1. The insurance and investment (with InvestSaver) transactions are counted for 12 months only. I really wonder why as those are very likely recurring payment.  2. You have to login to the website to find the bank and earn summary, not available in the app.  3. The app is not good enough. For example: - it doesn‚Äôt support copy and paste on iOS, if you try to toggle between apps to check payee details the app will bounce you back to login page. - no way to find out the total of unbilled credit card spending till statement date. - generally the app is slow  Just hope that the new app is going to better!"
5,I am using this and I get a lot of cashback! Loving it so far and  it really helps a lot. This is sooo goood
5,"Great so far, got a posb everyday mastercard and have been making at least 1 transaction a month with it and set up crediting salary into the account to unlock the 1.85% interest every month.   Too lazy to worry about hitting minimum spend to qualify for additional interest like what other savings accounts offer so this was a great choice for me."
4,"Been using this multiplier account for almost a year. I like that it doesn't force you to have a minimum credit spending, and I can still earn almost the same interest as SSB while having the liquidity of actual cash at hand in the bank. Only thing is that its quite hard to max out all the tiers and categories. Unless you buy a house, but oh well life is not perfect. "
4,"Best account for fresh grad who just start working. You can get the best interest just credit gu our salary into the account. For credit card spend, no minimum is required and you can achieve even higher interest by Buying posb invest saver which is relatively stable investments t"
5,Very easy criteria for saving accounts and one of the most transparent in the market. Almost never wrong choose DBS. Service are the best among other bank in Singapore
5,DBS multiplier is good as it gives us more interest than regular savings account. It also helps us keep track of what we have been spending on a monthly basis! 
5,Best interest rates in Singapore for any banks. Customer service is quick to respond especially in live chat. Reliable and easily accessible islandwide. App is relatively easy to use as well.
5,This is arguable one of the best saving accounts for fresh grad with the low salary crediting and a mix of other products to increase the interest rates 
5,"Good save to save plan that rewards you , instead of other spend to save schemes. Easily attainable 2% "
5,Awesome saving accounts that increase my savings substantially. Gd interest rate and I highly recommend to my family and friends.
5,"Have been using dbs multipler, good interest rate for a savings plan. No issues with getting the interest"
5,"Used to be user of OCBC 360, until last year came across with DBS multiplier. Glad that I have switched to DBS multiplier as it has one of the best interest rate for salary crediting account with easier requirement meets. Any amount spend on credit card will do (no min spend). Have used this for 1.5years and no complain to it!"
5,Have been using multiplier account for few years. Good ways to save money as it separate my cash from my main bank account
5,Very simple and easy to setup an account.  Just hit the few categories such as salary crediting and investment and watch your money grow.  Will recommend to my friends! 
4,Easy to apply and not that difficult to hit the requirements. But to hit all the requirements would be harder for me as I do not have any housing loans. Quite good interest rates!
4,"it needs no minimum amount for the salary credit and the credit card spending category, this is useful for people with low salary and yet wants to enjoy the many benefits"
5,"This account provides flexibility and caters to all salaried employee. It also caters to different savings/spending needs. In addition, interest rates are competitive in the market, providing good returns. "
5,"Application is really easy if you already are an existing customer with POSB/DBS. The criteria is easy to hit as well, personally I did salary crediting with credit card (no min spend for the multiplier), and I get 1.85% pa. "
5,Enjoyed high interest rate for first 50k. Relatively Easy to achieve the different tiers. However only valid for a year 
5,I have DBS Multipler since working last year. The interest is attractive compared to other bank and feel save to put it in DBS. 
5,Very easy to understamd and good criteria to hit. Been using for more than 2 years already. Will continue using
5,Best savings account ever in Singapore! High interest rates when you reach the next tier! Best decision ever
5,"My 50k is kept liquid in this account and earn reasonable interest. Fuss free, flexible and no tracking required. "
4,"Their multiplier scheme is always one of the most competitive for my combination. Esp love it for no minimum sum for credit card spending"")"
5,Current user of Multiplier and it's currently offering the highest interest rate. Can be eligible easily since only need to have at least one other service with DBS!
5,Good for fresh graduates or people who have worked for 2 to 3 years as its simple and fuss free. Just need spend 1 dollar on credit card and its useful for people that do not spend over 500 dollars as other banks like uob or ocbc requires for minimum credit card spending to gain interest for the saving account
5,"Great plan to capitalize on your spending with an all-in-one account, for easy management too. Remember to determine your own suitability for their plan, to match your needs"
4,ITs best to use it with a DBS credit card. This would boost your savings interest rate to at least 1.55% if you credit your salary here and spend at least $500 per month. The best savings account
5,Pros:  -Easy to met  -Can be use with ongoing promotion from DBS (like SAYE etc.)  - Active Burrow page for us to get MORE discoutn on top of normal DBS ongoing promo   Cons:  - Ony capped at $50k  
4,"Very new product to recapture the hearts and cash of locals!  Excellent for those who earns below $2400 gross ($2000 take-home) Extremely useful for those with outstanding (soon to have) *home-loans*, or get their *insurance* from DBS instead of a Financial Planner.   Don't limit oneself to only 1 additional category transaction, e.g. *Home Loan* only, get into the *Investment* portion via Trading Platform- Vickers OR Invest-Saver.  However, the *Credit Card* spend will be a problem if the account holder does not earn $30,000 (gross annual) as they can't even apply for a card to began with.  "
2,DBS banker did not manage to explain Self employed no monthly salary not qualified.  Overall i think it is a good way for more saver and earn abit more interest out there.  DBS still one of the most famous bank in Singapore.   All the best
5,"I could never earn any rebate nor interest with other banks without having multiple hoops to hop through. Now, with DBS I just sit back and let the interest roll. I regretted not having it earlier, could have accumulated $3k plus more interest. üòÇ "
4,Currently using DBS Multiplier as I'm investing using Vickers as well as having my pay sent into there. (having more services used on DBS grants greater interest rate btw) Customer service is decent as well. Could get better rates elsewhere but it's a bit too much work for me to source and apply a new account etc. 
5,"Very happy after DBS revamped their multiplier account. Like the fact that no minimum on any of the categories, hope it will stay this way."
5,"DBS Multiplier was extremely easy to set up. For a savings account, it offers very decent returns, which can be increased by fulfilling more categories! I like the fact that there is no minimum spending that needs to be charged to my credit card, making this the perfect account to be used for a fresh grad!"
5,"The interest is so easy to earn and there is not much hurdle . just have a regular 2k income , spend at least once on your dbs/posb credit card and have dividends credited into your dbs acccount"
5,Get higher interest with less spending criteria. Unlike other banks which require you to have 3-5 ticks in order to enjoy the high interest.
4,"Switched from ocbc 365 to multiplier. Great rates, could be better if 50k cap was removed though. There's also a minimum sum that needs to be maintained else there would be an admin charge. The burrow is a great add on for multiplier users, really enjoy the promos "
5,"I like how it was super fuss free for me to earn one of the best interest rates for a savings account. My salary was already credited in a POSB account, which is counted as a component for the DBS Multiplier Account. I only needed to spend minimally $1 on my credit card to get a 1.8% interest p.a. No sweat at all! "
4,"Without a doubt the simplest way to accumulate higher interest when compared against competitors like UOB One and OCBC360. The account is easy to understand and v useful! Moreover, it is also a multi currency account which makes payment overseas so much easier and cost efficient! :) however, it would be good to increase the $50k max amount to $75k to be in line with other banks!!"
5,"Probably the best savings account out there... plenty of innovation in motivating you to save like special interest rates thats far better than most fixed income dep, time deposit, etc. The Burrow initiative takes the client relation management even higher with promotions exclusive to members. "
4,"Love the high interest rate. There should not have any cap of $50000 that is eligible for the high interest rate. In addition, should do away the minimum monthly amount of $3000 inorder to waive off the account maintenance fee."
5,Have switched from OCBC 360 to DBS multiplier. Easy to earn interest by just clocking one transaction and salary credit. Also easy for me to manage my finance as my base account is DBS. No need to always worry which credit card and how much to use to clock the interest.
5,"This account is great for young starters in their first jobs! given the high interest rates compared to other fixed deposit accounts, it offers you the liquidity and flexibility without the lock in period. Also, it doesn't force you to spend 500 a month on your credit cards and pay bills by giro unlike UOB one and OCBC 360."
4,"If the employer pays salary on the last day of the month and somehow delays a particular salary payout by one day, you will end up not getting your interest for that month. I called DBS once to ask about this issue, they said well at least it helps to raise the interest rate tier for the subsequent month. But come on, it's not nearly as much as the amount you lose for the current month. So the only flaw I see here is how they must cut off strictly by calendar month. If your employer pays in the middle of the month instead then maybe you won't face the issue."
5,"I applied for the DBS Multiplier and was surprised at the amount of interest rate that (flat & step up interest) I can easily receive on a monthly basis just by fulfilling two categories and more if I fulfill three categories. Unlike other banks, there is no need to be good at maths to count if what categories or amounts have I fulfilled. It is also easy to track with a bank & earn summary page, so there's no way the bank will shortchange you. LOL. Besides that, we can still withdraw and spend the balance in the account, of course the higher the balance, the more $$$ you get. Plus! interest is counted on a daily basis so there's no need to struggle to maintain a certain balance at the end of the month. Just deposit your salary into any DBS/POSB account & fulfill an additional category. I've been spending yet saving at the same time! I haven't come across any other savings account that is as flexible and easy to manage than the Multiplier. What's more, there is a facebook private page which allows members to ask questions, answer questions, get some good deals, tips, courses, events, etc.  "
4,"One of the most fuss free higher interest savings account around, just need to make a one-time trouble to inform HR of the banking in of salary, the rest of the months you just need to make sure you make at least one credit card transaction with your DBS/POSB card.  The monthly bill will also show breakdown what are amount of transactions that are eligible for the bonus interests.  I'm still giving it a 4-star as the limit of the eligible amount for the bonus interest is at $50K. UOB One Account is better as it is equally fuss free, and it has set $75K for the limit of the eligible amount for the bonus interest and the average interest works out to be 2.45% if you've $75K in the account."
3,"I think dbs multiplier give better interest rate than fd , recommended however we need to fulfill their criteria to enjoy this interest rate"
5,"Really good for generating extra interest. Plus your salary need not be credited into this account but into any of your our POSB/DBS accounts for the extra interest. Note that if your apply for Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB), it is also counted as investments with POSB and will generate extra interest for you."
5,best feature that makes DBS Multiplier stand out from the rest : no need to track your spending amount of the month on credit card. any amount spent will be considered hitting that category. then you can use other cards of your choice to earn miles/rebates!   to improve: maybe can increase the limit of savings amount earning the preferential rate ...
5,"Good Interest Saving account for DBS Multiplier. Consider one of the highest interest rate Saving Account in the market. No minimum spend on credit card monthly and can easily go up to two or more transaction including salary credit in. Bonus Interest are credited every month. It will be even awesome if higher interest rates are applicable to the S$ balance in your DBS Multiplier Account, can go even higher than S$50k.  #PowerOfCommunity #SeedlyReviews #sharonchan78"
5,"Easy to qualify for the extra interest. Better than the other banks.  Insurance, stocks, bonds and all wealth management products all can earn extra interest. A single platform for all wealth management products.  DBS is also the best for its digital banking. Easy to navigate for the banking services and products. DBS Vickers is also one of the best securities firm. Lower commission as compared to others. Best stock analysis report too.  DBS also provide very good customer service to all.  "
5,"Opened a DBS Multiplier in Jan 2018 and totally loving it as it is so easy to achieve its highest 3.5% interest for me and my hubby‚Äôs individual Multiplier Account with a DBS joint account to credit ourr salaries and dividend / SSB interest from CDP into. Best of all, no minimum spending on credit card, just need to clock a transaction once a monthly on the DBS/ POSB credit card. Finally a high interest yield account that does not required us to spend spend spend to hit the interest tier. "
5,"DBS did a great job revamping the Multiplier account to meet the needs of everyday people. I personally deposit salary (into my POSB account), use POSB everyday card (Ez-link card reload is super convenient), and invest (dividends are counted!) to meet the tiered requirement. What I like about this account is that it is really fuss free, and there is a very active facebook group manned by Cheryl, and the various inputs from the FB group members always provide good information. Having used both OCBC 360 and UOB One previously, the DBS multiplier really checks all the boxes for me. Ideally, if the account limit eligible for bonus interest can be raised, that would be outstanding."
5,"I have utilised the Multiplier account to the maximum of its abilities.  I have created a joint account with my dad, and together with our 2 additional categories for the bonus interest and coupled with his higher salary, we are able to bump up to fully maximise what we have to get the higher interest tiers.  Further to that, we have also put in $50,000 each into our respective Multiplier accounts to maximise the bonus interest.   No qualms about it so far - except for the process of opening joint accounts at DBS which can be quite a chore given the long wait even with the SMS queue system that provides a short notice of around 5 to 10 mins only.  The account itself works perfectly fine and I am happy to use it to juggle most of my financial transactions, as well as enjoying the higher interest tiers under the account."
5,I applied for the DBS Multiplier and was so surprised but right now I already received a total for $25 for just opening up the account. I could have open it earlier. 
5,"This is consider high returns on saving as interest given is higher than normal saving accounts. From the period of time i try out this service, i can see there is a growth. Strongly recommend to try out this service."
5, best saving account in singapore. High interest rate and lots of perks. I really recommend everyone to try it out!
5,"I love how easy it is to hit the higher tier interest rate. As simple as $2500, and a combination of their criteria at that.   One thing that stood out from their competitors is that they even have a facebook page. It makes things much easier with almost instant answers to questions that people have as the community can help in answering questions too. "
4,"I have started switching to DBD multiplier account since 2016 after taking the home loan. Thus I have a savings account (salary linked), credit cards (Everyday cards, home loan as well as DBS vickers. The interest stacks as you have more accounts with them. I saved a maxi of 50k in the account to enjoyed the benefits and the interest every month amounts to 80-98... which adds as a form of passive savings to my other retirements which I will enjoy as Long as I am gainfully employed. This will be a good start for people who wants Low risks savings."
5,Good start for newly employed grads like me to credit salary in. Pretty attractive sign up bonuses and good interest rates! 
5,"Applied for a DBS multiplier account, process was smooth. Walked over to a branch and with an existing savings account, they assisted me with their readily available online platform to register my NRIC and Status. After which, i asked a few critical questions such as ‚Äúwill the existing amount in my savings be incorporated with DBS Multipler‚Äôs interest rate?‚Äù As if not it would have defeated the purpose. Account itself was clear and concise on the mobile platform, interest rates are timely and punctual and definitely more than their competitors. No cheque books are required which makes it digital and environmentally friendly for customers. Suitable for working adults who has just started to ‚Äúsave‚Äù. Ultimately a joy to check your bank account at the end of every month to see the interest!   Cheers"
4,Good start for newly employed grads to credit salary in. Pretty attractive sign up bonuses too if you join the burrow group on fb
5,"Probably the best bank accounts with high interest rate as of now considering the high interest given and the criteria to hit to obtain the higher interest. With their own FB community (The Burrow), this account is perfect for people who like high interest bank account and surfing facebook daily :p. Check out their FB group for more promos / deals / events / finance information!"
3,"After setting up this account, i realised i could not meet some criteria. But i was surprised to receive a $20 gift from posb. "
5,Just signed up for the multiplier saving account. The next thing is to get a credit card to complement with it! 
5,Great offer from DBS. Especially we are allowed to combine with another promotion DBS BYOB. Love that there is no minimal credit card spend unlike other bank. 
5,Easy to get return of 2%. Here is how I maximised the interest: (1) Salary crediting  (2) Spending via credit card - ANY AMOUNT WILL DO  Just buy $1 Apple pie or $0.80 Vanilla Cone from Mac every month :)   (3) STI ETF RSP  Sales charges is waived by DBS with their ongoing promotion 
4,"Switched from OCBC 360 to Multiplier as it gives me higher interest rate. It is good as it does not require minimum spending for credit card. With that, I need not to track my spending to hit the target for the higher interest rate. "
4,"I highly recommend the DBS multipler account! Can easily get 2% interest, which is wayyy more than the usual 0.05% in normal POSB savings account. Only downside is that the high interest rates are applied to the first $50,000. Hope they will increase this in the future."
5,Great savings account for people who credit salary. Simple to register if you have existing dbs account.  **Joint savings account hack complement with multiplier to hit possible higher interest tier!
4,"Had this account for just over a month and I‚Äôm quite satisfied so far.   What I like: - their internet banking ‚ÄòBank & Earn‚Äô page shows all the qualifying transaction amounts so you don‚Äôt have to calculate how much more you need for bonus interest. - both mobile and internet banking are clean and user friendly. - no minimum amount for each category so I could spend very little on my credit card and still get higher interest. - there‚Äôs a Facebook group for holders of this account where they share discussions and deals - easy to open account, I did it on the way to work using digibank  What I dislike: - range of credit cards not ideal for me as a low spender (most have high minimum spend for cashback/rewards) - few categories to choose from - only new investments can qualify - min $3k average daily balance (update: waived for those aged below 29. Yay!)"
5,Easily one of the best saving accounts for salaried workers (for now)...  Does not encourage spending and encourages people to save and invest!  http://kpo-and-czm.blogspot.com/2018/04/dbs-multiplier-ssbs-joint-account-higher-interest.html
4,A good interest return of 2% monthly easily even for young working adults. I like how investing in POSB invest saver increases the interest rate too. The only complain is I have is the slow bank and earn summary update they have to show us our overall entitled interest rates
5,Switched from 360 to multiples. Reasons:   Previous 360 setup: salary credit + giro pay total 1.5%  Current multiplier: salary credit + credit card spend +  RSP for buying some unit trust/ bond total 2.0%  Plus point: the giro that used in 360 can pay via DBS altitude card for earning some point .  Both tasks is easily achieve but apparently DBS multiplier interest is higher.
5,"Great account for someone that just entered the workforce. Only require salary crediting. Simply spend $1 on an eligible card to get more interest. Although the bonus interest is cap at 50k, it can always be doubled up with your partner's multiplier account as your salary credited into a joint account will count towards both multiplier account!"
3,Talk to a banker at DBS and went through financial need analysis etc. After that I decided to open a DBS multipler account and also purchase an endowment. The application process was very tedious due to the fact that there was system error during application and we actually filled up the application forms 4 times. IMagine the number of times I need to sign on the ipad.  Luckily my banker is a nice guy who kept making sure that I am comfortable and patiently answered all my questions. 
5,"Wanted to share interesting observations from my interaction with DBS   I recently just setup both the multiplier account and a DBS Vickers account online   Some of the benefits from the linkage  1) single sign on from iBanking into Vickers - no need to remember a separate login ID and password but 2nd factor Auth is still in place(security is important!) 2) consolidated view from iBanking - but details are still in Vickers portal  3) No need for set up of giro payment services after a trade has been executed - auto deduction  4) The whole setup becomes a ""cash upfront account"" when trading in Vickers - lower trading cost   I think DBS has done a great job in reducing the process and making it easier for customers to bank and trade.   "
5,"Very pleased with my multiplier account for the high interest rates it gives with quite minimal efforts that i put in. Especially appreciative that transactions across other dbs/posb accounts qualify, so I don't have to change my CDP account and don't have to bother my HR with another salary crediting account change."
5,"DBS Multiplier is a quick and easy way to earn a higher level of interest on my savings. I was able to easily open a Multiplier account and promptly transferred most of my savings into it.  I like that it progressively bumps up or drops the % of interest earned each month depending on if you fulfill the criteria across DBS banking products.   One of the cons as many have pointed out is the fall below fee if I don't have a minimum of $3,000 in my Multiplier account, but considering that the amount of interest I have earned within a short two months has been significantly higher than what I used to get and nothing in my spending or banking habits have changed.   It really makes sense to switch to this if you're already charging to your credit card regularly for payments.  I've given it 5 stars because DBS has taken effort to engage the community via a Facebook Group, The Burrow, to help customers understand their products and Multiplier better. (I was honestly a bit confused at first.) The Multiplier Account Summary is also a really helpful ""at-a-glance"" to figure out what % of interest I'll be getting for the month based on my transactions. "
5,A simple and easy way to generate higher interest from all the existing transactions that i have with the bank (salary credit; credit card usage and crediting of dividend from Spore shares). The step up interest for me is approx 3%. For a 50K multiplier acct; can get approx $100 /month. Great savings interest. You should try it too.
5,Been using multiplier for a few months now.  Pros - easy to hit the additional interest category:  Salary deposit Credit Card Spend  these alone will entitle me 1.85% interest rate.   Cons - you have to keep $3000 of balance because there is a fall below fee. Other than that all good. :) 
5,Been with CIMB Securities since 2014. I started using this platform during a stock challenge organised back during school days and really liked the platform since then.   Pros:  - Numerous indicators and up to date information for both technical and fundamental analysis - iBillionaire app that gives retail investors visibility to trade patterns of big players in the market - Brokers that send updates and outlooks several times a week  Cons: - Fees not exactly the cheapest in the market but still reasonable
4,"intuitive trading platform and pretty easy to use.  if all else fails, call in to the brokers and they are helpful enough to execute the trade on your behalf at the same commission as you trade online.  happy with my experience so far"
5,"Has Stock Filter that allows filtering based on Fundamental Analysis (e.g. PE Ratio, Return on Equity).  Has iBillionaire that shows what stocks the Big Boys are buying and selling in real-time.  Highly recommended!"
5,CIMB securities has been great. Has a no of features e.g I-screeners as well as the trade queues that I used as reference. 
5,"CIMB trading platform is one of the feature rich platforms I have used and to my experience their trading tools features fits all kinds of investors from sophisticated to novice investors. Market Streamer on ITradePro platform is a wonderful tool for sophisticated users to know various events like gap up, gap down, block trades etc during live trading hours. It's customizable layout  supports multiple market depths, charts and many features to be arranged in single view for quick view, analysis and trading.  I*Screener allows to screen through stocks across many exchanges based on technical and fundamental analysis with easy to understand stars and risk dial. It also signals the stocks that are recently upgraded and downgraded. Supportive and friendly customer service staffs.  "
5,"I opened trading account with CIMB Securities at My Village mall 1 year ago and have did a few trades through the broker in Singapore market. I have chosen them because they have good promotion (50% com rebate for Singapore market) and they also provide free US live prices for newbie. The representative is very professional and assist me on my queries when I call in for assistance. I had also attended the iTrade platform & mobile application seminar. As I am a newbie to investment I have learn a lot from them. Such as how to look at chart, find fundamental info of the companies and using their feature stock filter to gather high dividend stock within split second.   The platform is good but if they can enhance the mobile application to provide historical trades data it will be good so I will not need to depend on the itrade website.  My overall experience with them is good. Please keep it up and I look forward for more upcoming features that can help in my investment."
5,"I like itrade because it has many good features such as i-filter which filter big block trades , i-screener which rates stocks on 17 exchanges and iBillionaire which shows you the portfolio of 15 billionaires own. Lastly itradepro an adavance trading platform which allows trader to customise layout, up to 6 screen vision, single click action and lightning order submission. This is a world class and decision making platform. Keep it up CIMB Securities!"
5,cimb securities has the best service!  efficiency and convenient platform! have been with them for past 3 years and service is still the same.  as good! 
5,I love my UOB One Card! Great rebates and interest on UOB One Account. UOB also has amazing dining/travel/retail deals and discounts. 
4,I signed-up because of the attractive 3.88% interest with the UOB One Account. Makes sense to use it as my daily card. Also helps that it comes in a really fancy chrome coloured card!
5,"Maybe I'm a bit biased but this card fits my spending needs. Used it mainly for insurance, and then followed by bill payments and other fixed recurring expenses. Set it right to $2,000 a month and get $300 credit every quarter. $300/($2,000 x 3) = 5% rebate my credit card bills. Plus extra interest in UOB One account. Happy man here! :)"
5,"Perfect for wedding banquet expenses - my wife and I split our banquet payments monthly, $2,000 each, for over a year - and got back a couple of thousands from our spend. Not too bad for something we were already committed to spending on, right/ "
5,"#Weddingbanquethack All couples looking to book your wedding venue or have already booked, this is for you.  I'm sure you all know the mechanics of the UOB one card. To hit the maximum tier of 5% cash rebate, you need to spend $2,000 every month, for 3 months in a row. There is also a minimum transaction of 5 per month.   For everyday spend, hitting $2,000 is quite insane hence I never considered this card until recently when I confirmed my wedding venue. I checked with my wedding coordinator if I could make monthly payments for my banquet and to my delight, it is possible.  I am making 5 monthly payments every month of $400 each to hit the $2,000 spend and 5 transactions a month. I have gotten my first 5% rebate recently! The opportunity cost of paying the $2,000 every month is obviously that you can't use it for investment etc but getting 5% rebate should cover the potential returns if you invested the $2,000 instead.  If you are a UOB one account user, this hack is even better for you (sadly I am not) hence hopefully this helps!! "
3,This card give one of the higher rebate. However to get the higher rebates of 3.33%  you would need to hit exactly 500 for 3 months. Spending  700 for 3 months and 500 for 3 months gives the same rebate - $50.   Would recommend only for folks with uob one account and have fixed monthly spending of excatly 500 a month for maxium benefit. E.g  -recurring telcos for family 100 -recurring broadband 100 -recurring petrol - 300  
4,"Using this card for fixed expenses like Prudential insurance, singtel mobile & internet bills and conversancy fees.  Combining it with UOB one account for maximum benefits. "
5,"Great rebates especially if you use GRAB, can get back up to 10% cashback and the rebates are disburse on time every quarter. "
5,Very good credit card to unlock the UOB One Account interest. However the bill cycle affects the calculation of the interests which make it hard to do tracking 
5,"The UOB One Card is hands down UOB‚Äôs favourite entry level credit card ‚Äì especially for those with a UOB One account too. The credit card owes its fame to its key proposition: a maximum of 5% cash rebate on everything, no need to futz about with different spending categories. "
5,One of the most attractive cash rebates in the market and its pretty straightforward to use. Will definitely recommend it to my peers.
4,"Surprisingly, the UOB One account is one of the few that won‚Äôt give you a headache, even if you have a severe maths allergy. It has a very simple structure and easy-to-attain bonus interest ‚Äì minimal calculations needed. "
5,Best cash rebate card that link to the one account. Rebate is instantly for my stmt. Will recommend it to family and friend! 
5,"The best cash back credit card out there in Singapore, straight forward rebates without any requirement on spending with categories."
5,Best cash rebate credit card in the market! No fuss and hussle  free! Insurance can be charged too!!!

3,"Switched from OCBC to UOB for awhile due to the higher interest rates and I applied for this card to hit the credit spend requirement. However, I would think this card us more suitable for users who ar diligent at tracking their expenses. You need to spend a minimum of $500 on cash rebate eligible transactions for 3 consecutive months of your statement quarter to receive cash rebates. And also, one has to charge a minimum of 5 transactions per statement month. Too much work for a lazy cardmember. However, if you're getting married and paying for your banquet, this is a pretty good card to earn your cashback on. You can request for the vendor to split the payment into 5 transactions and pay monthly."
4,Used for about 6 months now. The bonus interest only gets substantial when the quantum amount in the savings account is huge. Advisable for someone who has spare cash lying around. 
5,"Great card in terms of cashback and upfront discounts, especially for petrol if you can hit the minimum spending each month!"
5,"I have been using this card for my wedding expenses! Although it has been a little stressful to ensure payment is done to get the maximum cashback of 5%, overall it has been a good experience so far. One thing to note is to make sure transactions are done earlier because most operators take a few days to approve the transaction. Even if you make the transaction before the statement due date, it doesn't mean you will fulfil the cashback. I have encountered something similar and tried appealing to get the cashback. Happy that UOB was understanding and approved it in a few working days! Customer service has been responsive. "
4,"Thou troublesome to track, many stuff falls under the min spend, so it fits my needs to get the min rebate each month!"
4,"This card is great for tracking your monthly expenses. You have to spend $500 at least per month and you could get cash rebates of 3.33% which sounds attracting for me. Furthermore, you can use it on your monthly bills. There is no limitations on where you use it."
5,"Been using this in conjunction with cardup to get cash back for my monthly rental + automating 4 other monthly expenses into this card to hit the 5% cash back requirements.  Similar to other users, once you hit the 2k monthly spend, you can get a 5% cashback and it hits the higher tier UOB One Savings account interest rate.   Highly recommended. :)"
4,I am using this card to pay for my banquet. Easy to meet the 2k monthly requiremnet to get the 5% rebates. 5 different transactions required so have been allocating 1.6k for the banquet and 4 other transactions. 
4,"Have been using this card for years, charging my monthly fixed expenses such as insurance, internet, subscriptions, and variable expenses such as transport, groceries, never had a problem hitting the min. spend."
3,Have rebates when you shop at supermarkets but other than not a lot of benefits. An average card to have and I only use it occasionally. Other cards are better! 
5,"It is one of the great card to own it as the rebate system makes me spend even more.   As i spend more at guardian and Cold Storage, the rebates allows me to earned more at the same time."
3,"Been using the One Card to get a higher interest rate for my One account. Here's my take based on my usage and some points for consideration:  + Higher interest rates for your savings (if you can fulfill the $500 min spending per month) - Have to monitor to ensure you maintain min spending of $500 to get the cashback - Have to fulfill minimum spending of a higher tier for all three months within the quarter to qualify for the cashback amount of the higher tier (explained in my experience below)  points to note: *Topping up of ez link card does not count towards min spending *Take note of your billing cycle and the months that count towards your ""quarter"" for your cashback.  My personal experience was that I've missed out on the middle tier cashback for the few months where I had to spend more (which was the last few months of 2017, because of travels and buying of gifts) because I've failed to take note of my billing cycle. I've missed out on the fact that my billing cycle was not from the start of the month, some of the spendings were taken as the next billing cycle (for the next quarter).  Sadly, although my total spending for the three months (due to uneven distribution of spending for those three months) that made up the quarter (for cashback calculation) was more than $3000 (which would be average of $1000/month), I did not qualify for the $100 cashback for that quarter.   Overall, I will use this to get the minimum $50 cashback (per quarter) and for the higher interest on my One account. Beyond that, I would use another card for any spending over the $500 (as it is unlikely for me to spend more than $1000 consistently for three months consecutively, not to mention that the three months had to coincide with my ""quarter"" as defined by UOB)."
3,"This card is only good if you are diligent in tracking your expenses and can hit a minimum of $500 charge on cash rebate eligible transactions for 3 consecutive months of your statement quarter. Cash rebate ranges from 3.33% to 5.00% depending on our monthly charges in the quarter. I used to like this card very much as it is really easy to receive 3.33% quarterly cash rebate, and recommended it to my friends about it. However, the card has evolved since it is first launched and now it has lots more additional terms and conditions in place before one can receive the full benefits of this card. Not to mention that now one has to charge a minimum of 5 transactions per statement month for the cash rebate to be awarded, along with a list of exclusions.   There are a number of instances that I did not receive the quarterly rebates due to my oversight. There is once when I fulfill all the terms and conditions except on one of the months where I absent-mindedly charged $2,000 in one single transaction and glad that I have hit $2,000 per month for my statement quarter. Only to realised later on that I did not hit the minimum 5 transactions requirement on that month. On another time, I mistaken my statement quarter and charging $2,000 for 3 months (say Month A, B, C) and $500 in the following month after that (Month D), thinking that it is the start if a new statement quarter. To my horror, Month B, C and D is my statement quarter and I only gotten back 3.33% rebate instead of 5.00% that i have aimed for.    Hence, this is definitely not a card for the busy, forgetful and lazy spender. If one is prepare to do the work to track your charges, this is actually a great card to have. Even better if you use this credit card and set up a UOB One account which gives a 2.43% pa interest for a saving balance of $50,000 if you meet the monthly minimum $500 credit card charge and 3 GIRO transactions requirement.   In my opinion, UOB One card is the card that keeps me on my edge as it can result in painful opportunity cost if you overlook any of its terms and conditions due to the quarterly cash rebate structure. By the time you found out about your oversight, you have already invested at least 3 months of your time and effort charging expenses to this card. Therefore, think and plan properly if you intend to use this card. "
5,"Perfect for me with UOB One. Only sad time was I spending $1 less than my targeted $2000 for one of the 3 months. Oh well, it forces you to track your spending near the end of the month (highly recommended to change cycle to follow calendar month)"
4,This credit card is a bit of a double edge sword if you are not good at tracking your expenses the spending doesn‚Äôt reap any returns.   Pros 1) Good tie up with UOB account that gives you good int rates on your bank account with min 500 spend per month on the card + 3 Giro(no need for salary credit !)  2) Good for everyday use with no fixed tiers or specific domains   Cons  1) tracking has to be done based on amount of rebates you want to earn  2) Billing cycle and transaction dates is a hassle to track  3) rebates is given at the end of 3 months  4) if you miss spending in one of the months you get no rebates   Overall if you are meticulous in your spending and keep an eye on the billing cycle and transaction dates then this is the perfect card for you. If you are lazy then look else where because the frustration of spending on the card and getting nothing is very real.
4,"It's good for the fixed expenses that won't fall under better categories - for me, I charge my monthly Prudential premium and my utilities bills (through manual payment at the SP service center) and the odd fast-food purchase and that's sufficient for the base 500.  It's easier in the sense that you don't have specific categories to optimize but of course it isn't as good as the higher rebates you get for other cards.  More for the oddball uncategorized expenses than anything else."
3,"If you are able to spend consistently more than $500 every month with UOB one card, then the card is an ok deal  I am a small spender with credit card expenses (including Mac purchase) totalling less than $500 (approx expenditure $300+ per month), hence this card is not very useful to me"
5,Invested in the Growth portfolio since Feb 17.  Total return currently about 9%. Highly recommended.
5,"So simple, so easy to use. A great investment for someone who is too busy to monitor their investment. No unrealistic projections. "
5,"Part of initial rollout for Revolut card in Singapore.  Got email and doing initial set up Tuesday 17th, identity testing went quite smooth and after pic of ID card and selfie - There was a small wait (systems looking up databases?) but less than 10 minutes, I have access to app.  Unfortunately, a lot of functionality is locked until address verified (via posting of physical card) - so aside from topup, can't really do anything lol.  Need to top up S$20 minimum before can proceed.  The card itself took around a week to arrive.  [[Update - in other markets, it is possible to add value in various currencies; but no dice for SG based cards, as at this update (2 Oct), only adding value in SGD is supported ]]  Card arrived late 23rd and doing testing on 24th (for ref, it is a Visa as compared with YouTrip/Transferwise which use Mastercard).  First transaction supposed to be card-and-PIN but trying out local self-serve supermarket; PIN never asked for; transaction went through.  Afterwards, also tried contactless (paywave) and it went through as like any other card.  So POS transactions work well.  No ATM withdrawal functionality in Singapore so couldn't try that but did try PIN change.  Unfortunately a FAIL - no ATM could do it (tried Citi, POSB, OCBC).  In fact, none of the ATMs could even give card balance - so no use at all with ATMs.  This is actually a bit dumb since initial PIN setup is via app but PIN change is via ATMs which means essentially it is a non-reversible choice until Revolut fix this.  Virtual card set up is instant (just click relevant section in the app) but on attempt to use card - had issue; counterparty insisted for a card that can do SMS 2 factor verification and said Revolut virtual card doesn't qualify - so can't work there.  Tried on other website with less restrictive security setup and it was accepted with no issues.  On Revolut's side, virtual card is working fine but isn't fool proof to peculiarities of service provider requirements (to be fair, this would apply to regular credit cards issued by banks as well).  Transfer to other revolut users  - did a small FX exchange and sending across amount to relative in Europe (Sweden); payment link went ok and will be watching over next couple of days if transfers back-and-forth ok.  [[ Update  - was told that transaction went through ok immediately on app; but for counterparty to actually get money face the same (slow) process to transfer out as described below ]]  Transfers to bank account  - initiated transfer account in Singapore (in this case own account).  Do note need to have SWIFT code of target bank which isn't common place so a bit of a hassle.  Other downside is the transfers are very very very slow.  For the free transfers the quoted TAT is 1 week (!!!) vs the instant that is paynow.  Even when doing the ""turbo transfer"" at an cost of S$9 per transactions - TAT is 3 days (Tues -> Friday).  The delays seem related to issues with Singapore banks as a similar transfer to bank in HK was quoted as tomorrow (turbo) / 3 days (regular) (but didn't actually try for the latter)  [[ Update - Looks like underpromise and over-deliver - Original TAT promised was 1 week but then actually managed to clear funds by 3 days ]]  Analytics - didn't actually try out but if you have difficulty controlling spend and/or interested in some breakdowns on where money is going - there is some functionality in the app.  Other observations  - in other markets, Revolut comes with bank account details (eg UK will have current account) which can be handy for European SEPA users but nothing of the sort in SG initial rollout (no UK details nor Singapore details) (as yet - there is some ""coming soon"" in the app).  - the app security is a bit over-the-top and intrusive; need to enter passcode/fingerprint on every app open and phone unlock --- once is fine but then the security not being 'kept' for a period of time is annoying.  Even a brief lock-phone-to-lookup-bank-details-from-card-elsewhere will need a fingerprint unlock even if 15 seconds.  In the course of writing this review, had to unlock the app ~10 times.  The UX guys really need to look at this.  Overall - core functionality seems fine; but service is much emasculated compared to overseas offering and hope Revolut will be refining the offering post-rollout"
5,"Since I‚Äôve started using Revolut, it has become my main card for any type of payments, online or offline. So many perks and an amazing client experience, together with no or low fees, gorgeous cards and a complete control of my expenses."
5,"Great app. Identifying identity can be a little troublesome, but once that was cleared, the UI was easy to navigate and the card looks so pretty!"
5,"At the first time where I started the Revolut App I was stunned by how fast and easy I could create my own account. The verification took just 5 Mins. From this point Revolut surprised me more and more with all of it's perks (no /low fees, metal card, instant payments and notifications and many more )   And now I use it for my daily payments :) "
5,"I'm currently using the free account which already allows me to gain access to plenty of incredible functions. On top of their ability to spend overseas with 150 currencies with the interbank exchange rate, you can even send money domestically and internationally in 27 currencies, which I've used to top up my MCO account in Euros at zero cost.   You can top up the money with your credit or debit card. They also have a auto exchange function that will automatically convert your current currency into your desired currency once it reaches your desired exchange rate so you need not monitor the exchange rate throughout the day. Other functions include recurring payments, budgeting, splitting of bills and analytics on your spending.   For those who are concerned about Security, Revolut allows you to generate a virtual card so you need not worry about losing your card or even a disposable virtual card so you be safe from fraudulent activities. Other security features of the physical card include the ability to freeze your card, enable location-based security so you can only use the card in the same geographical area of your phone  disabling online transactions at anytime, setting a monthly spending limit and many more which are really impressive compared to the security features of other multi-currency card. In my opinion it is a must have for traveling!"
5,"Revolut has really changed the travel game for me! Some things that I really struggle with is the switching of currencies and the withdrawals of money when abroad, but with Revolut, it really simplified things and it also saved me some money!  The biggest difference though, is that I‚Äôm able to send money to friends in different currencies because of the multi wallet and sending money function!  Not to mention, they‚Äôre customer service has been marvellous! Prompt and extremely helpful!   If you‚Äôre looking for an efficient, effective and simple card, I would say Revolut is just the card you‚Äôve been looking for! It‚Äôs the one for me. :) "
5,"The absolute best way to handle your international banking needs. The big pro of using Revolut compared to other similar services is that they offer the interbank exchange rate (that is the same rate that banks buy currencies for). When you use your card abroad your bank will give you a rate that they made up, while Revolut will give you the best rate on the market without charging any fees! This can help you save thousands every year. In addition to this the user experience is absolutely incredible and you can send fast international money transfers. I cannot recommend Revolut enough!"
5,"Revolut is not new to the UK and Europe countries, I have buddies from Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, and others appearing on my Revolut contact list and I'm able to perform a fund transfer to Revolut users within a minute for free, this is great for cross border remittance as you pay no fee for this service, you cannot do that with TransferWise or YouTrip, this is a game-changer for the remittance industry. Only one catch is that transferring funds from the Revolut wallet to a bank account will go through SWIFT, which means the receiving Singapore bank will charge SGD$10 per transaction.  This is also an alternative option for Travellers that spend in overseas and if you are familiar with YouTrip, the function and features work the same as YouTrip, only the limit of SGD$9000 spending per month or else, there will be a minimal fee for anything spent above SGD$9000 for the month. If you travel extensively or spend a lot when you are overseas, it is worth to subscribe to the Metal plan as you get 1% rebates on all transactions, as long as you spend SGD$20,000 a year, you will gain back the Metal plan annual fee easily."
5,"Revolut is a new game-changer in the market with lots of new features that is amazing. I was also introduced to Revolut during the Seeldy x Revolut meet up and am really excited to share my perspective of the product itself.   Honestly, I really love this card and I believe this will be the future of how people are transaction and spending. You may wish to note that Revolut uses Visa whereas it will be a good complement as compared to YouTrip which uses Mastercard.   Pro tip: If you're thinking of which muti-currency card to use, here is a simple fuss fre tool:  - If the rate is good: Change before hand within the app. You get to hedge the amount first.  - If you're spending on a weekday: Users have been reporting that spending using Revolut is better as it charge inter-bank rate. YouTrip charges a small 0.3% rate against google rate. (i.e. Mastercard determined FX rate). - If you're spending on a weekend: Using YouTrip might be better as user reported that Revolut charges 0.5% rate against google rate (hearsay the charges starts from 8am Saturday).   As there are many features within the product, I will break them down as below:   (1) Topping up  Pros: You can top up via any Visa/Matercard. Noted that bank transfer will be added soon in the future versions.   Cons: You might wish to note that the MCC code is 6012, which really prevent a lot of credit card from getting point (yes, including UOB). MCC 6012 will be read as a payment to a financial institution. Also, noted that YouTrip cannot be used to top up the card as well. (tried, it failed). Oh, and Amex is not allowed as well.   (2) Bank details   Pros: In the near future, we will be able to get our bank details in each currency wallet. This is similar to the ""borderless account"" concept in Transferwise. Pretty cool to not having to set into the country and have a bank account set up. I believe this will be very useful for someone who is receiving foreign currency as a salary/students going for exchange.   Cons: The details of when it is release is not out yet and onl Transferwise has such features now. Also, it is only limited a certain number of countries.   (3) Analytics  Pros: Making use of data analytics, they are able to break down on how much you spent, on what and your estimated spending for the month (Wow!) After which, they can micro-segmentize the customers based on their spending habbits to get more incentive and cashback.  Cons: Feels like your spending is being watched.  (4) Bank transfer   Pros: You can make payment to your bank account/foreign bank account via International Swift Transfer. You money won't be stuck inside there anymore :)   Cons: That being said, this is why their MCC Code is 6012.   (5) Exchanging of money   Pro: The REALLY cool thing I LOVE about Revolut is how their platform works. You can auto set a target and based on the target, and they will transact if the target you set is met. Save the time to track, and time the market.   If you do a comparison against YouTrip at real-life rate, you can see the rate at Revolut is slightly better.   Cons: You may wish to note that you can only exchange up to $ 9,000. Subsequently, there is 0.5% charge.   (6) Customer service   Pros: Live chat 24/7  Cons: There is no hotline to call. Yes, you may see a number at the back of your card. But that is only useful if you wish to block your card. There is no human interaction.        "
5,"Really happy using this as my travel card. Like the ability to transfer money between my home country and Singapore so easily. App looks great too, keeps all my finances visible, notifications when I spend (great fraud control!) "
5,"Revolut is honestly a game changer in the payments arena. I could literally board my plane for my long-weekend trip to Bangkok without changing any currencies and enjoy my 4D3N hassle-free. Dynamic pricing is also so dependable, and not to mention a big selling point when compared to other multi-currency wallets. 5/5 would recommend this to absolutely anyone, but especially to travellers of any frequency. "
5,"Easy money transfers between currencies. Great for overseas use, tapping and swiping on my regular visits to JB. The card is chio too. "
5,Revolut is a game changer and it does more than change your money at close to real time rates. The UI&UX of the app is great; easy to navigate around and the design is clean. Love the vault function which helps you save money effortlessly. Plus point; they have great looking cards! 
5,"Free current account. No fee exchange in 29 currencies. No fee ATM withdrawals. View Pricing. Download Mobile App. Types: Standard, Metal, Premium."
5,"Amazing app!!! You can save tons of money on exchange rates. Perfect to be used when travelling . Also revolut has great analytics in order to know anytime what, where you spent. "
5,"Revolut has changed how I deal with my money. From the best-in-class user experience, having interbank exchange rates for converting to foreign currencies, through having control over my expenses & budgeting to having everything else in my pocket (Revolut app on my smartphone) including GPS tracking of my cards so nobody can steal my money. Astonishing service that I would only recommend!!!"""
5,"Best financial service for my daily banking. Not only I don't need to look for my banks ATM (free withdrawals up to 200 eur with the free card), but I also have my budgeting in the app & I can track where my money goes with a few clicks. You can also tweak w/ different security options in the app - switch contactless, online payments on/off, disable or enable online transactions and so on. There's just so much you can do that no other bank will let you. "
5,"Very simple and straightforward user interface. Topping up the account was easy using credit card and there were plenty of security tools that allows you to turn on / off real time to keep your account safe.   Real time viewing of exchange rate in app is definitely a function that I love so that i can do the conversion real time to know how much i will be spending in local currency.  The only 1 pity about Revolut is that it doesn't support 3DS transactions at the moment which requires SMS OTP verification. Other than that, its all good!!!!!"
5,"Revolut is everything your local bank isn't. It's simple to use, transparent, fast and convenient. Probably the best thing which has happened in Singapore's fintech scene.   Hopefully, they will bring in more features which are still not available here soon. "
5,"I use Spree card for my online purchases especially for overseas transactions, it gives 2% cash back!"
4,"Sign up for this card if: 1) you generally spend very little per month 2) make most of your purchase online or contactless  Generally, please with this card due to the above, despite the lower cash back % when compared with other credit cards"
5,I have started using this card for it‚Äôs cashback for online spending. Generally satisfied with this card and will continue using for online purchases :)
3,"I signed up for this because it has no minimum spend. The application was quick and easy as compared to DBS. However, I reduced the usage of this card as I feel 1-2% cashback is a bit Low. There are more competitive cards outside if you can hit like at least 300 a month"
4,"I use this card once I've hit the $500 min spending for my UOB One card.   + no min spending for the cashback - ez link top ups not eligible for cashbacks  Quite a straightforward card. I like it because there's no need to hit any minimum spending. Granted, the cashback amount is not considered high, it's better than not earning anything since I'm unlikely to hit a 1k min spend per month (for the next tier on UOB One Card), and other cards typically require a min spending of $500 or $600 to qualify for cashback (though their cashback % are usually higher). Yup.. so for me (based on my spending pattern), it's quite a good way to get back that extra few bucks every month. :)"
4,"This card is a cashback card. Essentially, its value proposition is similar to the SCB unlimited cashback card, in that it gives you cashback on all types of cc spending without any minimum spend required. The difference here is that it is slightly more specialized:-  - it gives 2% cashback on all SGD online spend and all mobile payments (Samsung Pay / Apple Pay / etc) and all contactless payments (Visa Paywave / Mastercard PayPass / etc). This is a very broad category which should cover most of your normal spending. - it gives 3% cashback on all foreign currency online spend - for any other retail spend that doesn't fall into the above categories, you get 1% cashback.  For most people, I believe the bulk of your spending will be on online shopping / eating in restaurants or cafes / shop at stores which most likely have a POS contactless terminal. For all these spending, you will likely be able to get the 2% cashback, which is mathematically better than the SCB Unlimied that only gives 1.5% cashback.  The only drawback I see are certain transactions which won't qualify for the 2%, such as: - insurance premiums - monthly deductions (e.g. utilities / telco / etc.) - shops which use magnetic swiping instead of contactless terminals  For such examples like those above, you should then use the SCB Unlimited card. Hence, I see this card as being complementary to the Unlimited Card. It's my go-to default cashback card for almost all my usual retail spend when I go out dining / shopping with friends."
4,Concerns regarding projects was responded  immediately by user engagement managers and this gave me confidence to invest with coassets long term.
5,"Got to know about Co Assets a couple of years back from a friend, and has been with them since. Great projects, and thanks Eugene for keeping me updated! :)"
5,"Pros:  (+) : Every investors is tagged to a user engagement officer  (+) : User engagement officer is just one whatsapp/call away  (+) : More conservative as compared to other P2P lending platform, which is a good thing as they perform one round of due diligence before accepting the project and passing the risk to the investors   Cons: (-) : Project is slightly limited. There's about about 3-4 project launced every quarter ever since I came onboard. "
5,"CoAssets' platform is easy to use & does not require any administration/management fees for investors, unlike other platforms. However, KYC (Know-Your-Client) form can be quite tedious  to complete. Default rate is at the lowest in the market, currently at 1.17% -- I am certain that my money is in good hands since CoAssets focuses on taking quality projects. Every investors are attached to one User Engagement Manager who constantly update you on its opportunities.   Great experience so far! "
5,"Sincerely enthralled by the services and investments that CoAssets have provided.   Scrolling back to 24 April 2018 with my first review on Seedly, i was a new investor coming onboard with half of my life savings thrown into one of their new projects with a promising return of 9% with a year long time frame.  Long story short, today i have received all my payouts punctually credited into my CoAssets account with follow ups from my UEM manager who promptly notifies me about the payments and upcoming opportunities, events and provides insights on the markets trends and figures.   Stipulated in the middle of CBD, Shelton Way, CoAssets has proven to be the leading P2P crowdfunding platform with an integrated application, certified, professional UEM managers and trustworthy investment opportunities with zero defaults till date.  Highly recommended for investors who are seeking a diversified portfolio with substantial returns as compared to ETFs, Unit Trust funds and Stocks.  "
5,"My past and present user engagement officers (Vanessa and Berlin) are very responsive and helpful. No admin/management fee is a big plus. Listed projects have undergone strict assessment. Impressed that company instills good discipline on employees, and also rewards them on good performance. "
5,"Pros:  (+) : Every investor is tagged to a user engagement officer. They are pretty friendly and they know their stuff. So far every question I have asked, financial or otherwise, have been handled well. Engaging with them is an easy process as they provide you with their contact number. (+) : They are a large P2P lending site with more credibility. You can have a look @ their financial statements as they are listed on the ASX. (+) : Pretty interesting financial products available other than the standard invoice financing and business term loans.  Cons: (-) : Project is slightly limited. There's very few projects available to invest in."
5,"I heard about CoAssets from my friend, Eugene who is working inside. They are expanding and i am sure they can continue to grow their wealth for their investors. Cheersüòäüëèüëèüëè"
5,"What's became of my biggest meaningful takeaway at CoAsstes is interacting with our members and investors on a daily basis. I am able to confidently let them know of the kind of projects we have on hand which are readily available for people from teens to the elderly. From meeting them, I have gained many interesting views from all walks of life and it was really satisfying to be able to guide them through their investment journey with us, especially when they always receive their payouts succcesfully and that they thank us for it."
4,"Have been working here for a year as my first official full time job. Comparing to other crowdfunding platforms that I am active on, CoAssets investments are relatively towards a higher quantum. (E.g. minimum 1k per placement)   Personally I am very heartened that they take the risk assessment of the projects seriously albeit I would wish that there could be more project offering. "
4,"I'm an employee of CoAssets. I came here right after graduation. what attract me most here is actually the products -secure and credible I say-compare to other investment products form banks or whatever. And here the first time I experienced the ""sold out"" of a certain product which has been quite enlightening. This is truly a company with a lot of potentials and prospects."
5,"I was introduced by a friend who is existing investors in CoAssets. I give a plus point to CoAssets mainly is because of my personal user experience, as it is user friendly, no matter in Apps or personal relationship manager who handling my account. And I believe CoAssets is another place for me to diversify my funds and grow my wealth, since they always provide secured short term opportunities and its return is consider higher in the current market. Hope they continue to deliver what they are doing. "
5,"Despite being just a minor investor, I do receive the birthday well wishes and cards personally from the CEO. I appreciate the team's extra effort to keep us engaged. Good personal touch!   The user engagement manager do constantly keep us updated via whatsapp. Good initiative as I don't look at my emails often.     "
4,"CoAssets' platform is definitely user friendly and easy to use even if you're not a tech savvy person. And the plus point is that, they don't charge any investor's fee!   Just some minor improvement needed, especially the Know-Your-Client (KYC) process as it could take quite bit of time to fill up all the necessary informations. Could improve it by shortening the process and it would definitely earn my 5 stars! "
5,CoAssets's platform is very user-friendly and the company values personal touch point with its investors. I did my first crowdfunding project with CoAssets and is pleased that it was paid out earlier. This increase my confidence in the company and will definitely participate more projects with them in future and recommend to my friends who may benefit as well. 
5,I am amazed by the dedication and the follow up from the User Engagement Team in CoAssets. Constantly updating me on my investment with them and inviting me down to their regular events.   They stands out from the rest of the platform and I enjoy my investing journey with them so far.  
5,I have received good service from them. Their rates are reasonable and safe as a crowdfunding platform. They do their due diligence pretty welll too!
5,"CoAssets stands out from the peers, not only because the niche industry portfolio, but more is their professional staff that always give the best support to the investors. They are very responsible and honestly analyze the risk and return for investment they are providing and advise the investor to make decision due diligence, "
5,"I've joined a few lending platforms and coassets really stands out. Their team is very friendly and helpful to share any information. Also I feel that the risks of their offerings (default rate) is one of the lowest, and given their rate of returns, make for pretty good investments if you want to find somewhere else to park your money."
5,"Been with them for a few months now and can highlight some pros: - Dedicated User Engagement manager who is very responsive and eager to help - Routinley hold events in order to get a look into the platform and the work they're doing - Publicly Listed firm which is growing and has audited financial statements - Seems to be a thorough risk-management framework which, while it limits the number of projects, ensures that the projects are relatively safer  The biggest con I can think of is that the minimums are a bit high so you do end up locking up the funds for the duration mentioned but this should not be a concern as long as you have liquidity to manage in the meanwhile.  All in all, an exciting setup"
5,"What makes coassets different from other platform is they will assign a user engagement team to assist you. They are so friendly and willing to share whatever they know to you, make you have a clearer picture about they company so you will have more confident about the business model. Besides that , their default rate is the lowest where every investor concern the most. The promissory note is much safer compared to other type of crowdfunding. They will have some gathering with investor as well so we ll know how the macro economy is going and make new friends "
5,"Been with them since the first year they started in 2013. Have always been impressed by their service level which is often quick, efficient and detailed.   The projects that have for offering in the past were usually real estate and they have now pivoted to business loans which may seem more risky but due to the setup of the loans with guarantors and backings makes it less risky.   Looking forward to more investment opportunities that are safer with better returns. They also do have a bar for coassets investors to hang out and enjoy at dempsey hill! "
5,"Got to know about Co Assets last year from a friend, my user engagement officer, Violet is very responsive and helpful. Great projects, and thanks Violet for keeping me updated! "
4,"I opened an account with CoAssets on 29 Apr 2019 as an investor.  Pros: 1) Capital Markets Services Licence granted by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). 2) Public listed company in Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). 3) Assigned a user engagement manager who has been providing updates on new projects, and whom I can enquire via WhatsApp. 4) The new projects updates will be sent a few business days before they are available to invest, so that one will have time to fund the account before the availability starts. 5) Each projects comes with a promissory note to protect investors' interest against possible defaults.  Cons: 1) Not many projects available to invest 2) Minimum investment amount of $5,000 is on the higher entry side as compared to other platforms."
5,"The team at coassets are knowledgeable and steadfast in their duties, ranging from patience for amatuer investors to knowledge and stats for the experienced. With credible sources and opportunity being offered by them, coupled with the digitalization in this field, i look forward to working more with them in the future. "
4,"Easy and sleek UI to use. Every investor is assigned a User Engagement Officer, who will personally whatsapp/call you to inform of the latest updates. Good personal touch!  However, it seems coassets has a lack of campaigns and loans due to the slower application of their license. Minimum sum to invest is $1000 which maybe steep for some and there is no fractional allocation. Also, no auto investing functionality."
5,"These are my comments on CoAssets:  (C)are, in their project selection. Companies or projects which are deemed too risky in their due diligence assessment are omitted for the benefit of their investors.  (O)pportunities. They offer interest niche projects in the movie industry which are good opportunities to diversify one‚Äôs portfolio.  (A)rticles. As an value added service to clients, they write insightful, dedicated articles (e.g. insight into the movie industry) which helps investors understand better the projects they are entering into.  (S)ervice. I‚Äôve received excellent service support from my relationship manager Laura. Whenever I have questions regarding certain projects she is always able to provide prompt, relevant, detailed & thorough explanations which clarify my doubts. She is devoted to provide quality service to clients, and I am pleasantly surprised by the gift she has delivered to me during the mid autumn festival. :)  (S)OAR 2019. This is a valuable seminar offered to their investors with an international reowned speaker in the panel!  (E)fficiency. I like the speed in getting projects funded so that investors can look forward to receive their returns sooner!  (T)rack record. They have achieved an impressive 0% default rate based on statistics as at Q2 2019. This is lower than competitors‚Äô default rates!  (S)urcharge, or rather the absence of. CoAssets do not have any hidden service fees or surcharges. The interest rate stated is exactly what the investor would get, which is what I like about them ‚Äì transparency."
5,"Been introduced to one of their platform since last year October. Staff is very approachable and readily available anytime.   As their mobile application seem relatively new, I expect to see more campaigns coming this year."
5,"Enjoy superior cover for worry-free holidays or business trips at some of the most affordable prices in the market. ERGO TravelProtect Travel Insurance provides comprehensive protection for your health, baggage and bank balance so you can focus on more important things ‚Äì like sightseeing, exploring and relaxing!"
5,Price competitive n good coverage for the yearly asia plan. Purchased it because I travel mostly within Asia
5,Probably the cheapest car insurance in the market now.  Easy to qualify for discounts like the NCD60 discount and doing things like installing a front facing camera. Easy to apply for too.
3,"Free for now.   CALLS:  Only phone with VoLTE can setup and make calls ( some tweaks and setup requires)  Tips: A few xiaomi model can achieve that! But not iphone.   DATA: 2GB data daily is more than enough for me.  So far so good, only gripe is NO SIGNAL NO DATA whenever go to any building basement (even ochard takashimaya basement) or any underground mrt.   Free for now. Cannot complain."
5,"*Update* Phone calls via VoLTE works now!   It's a free mobile plan offered for 12 months due to the ongoing trial, so I don't have any complaints.   Data is good as it's unlimited (2GB per day), the only con is that it loses signal when I'm underground. I can't make phone calls although I should be able to via VoLTE with my Samsung Galaxy S9.   Otherwise, it's an awesome free plan (for now) that everyone should take up now especially since roaming in Malaysia and Indonesia is free!"
4,"It is a free data plan for 12 months, and is capped at 2gb per day. Very useful as i use it to supplement my existing data plan. The data speed is also good. However, there is no coverage in certain areas, such as in mrt. "
5,"I've been using this service for the past few months. Their mobile data is great as of now. Unfortunately, no tunnel coverage (i.e MRT & CTE/KPE tunnel) as they're still work at progress. To use voice calls, one needs a phone with VoLTE. Not bad for a start. Customer service were impeccable! Considering to switch their service in the near future üòÑ"
4,"It's a free mobile plan offered for 12 months due to the ongoing trial which supposed to end Dec 2019!  Data is good as it's unlimited (2GB per day), the only con is that it loses signal when I'm underground like MRT or some basement of shopping mall.  I was able to received sms for otp but unable to make any phone call due to non volte HP.  Waiting to try their roaming services in Malaysia and Indonesia that will be available from July onwards!"
4,"Free everything is good! But coverage can be better!   Otherwise, no complains. Encourage everyone to try. "
4,"Pros: Completely free at this moment including: - Free unlimited 4G data for 12 month; - Free data roaming in Malaysia & Indonesia; Cons: - No signal when you are underground; - Does not support number port, you have to sign a new line; - No delivery service (since free), you have to collect your sim at their counter;  Overall, I am happy for the free service they are providing at least for now. "
4,Only can use on WhatsApp to call only use normal phone dial cannot but at least is unlimited data quite good.
4,"The Good: Free 2GB of high speed data. Now available for Indonesia and Malaysia.  The Bad: Zero coverage underground, and occasionally spotty coverage. VOLTE calls only valid for certain models- strangely, the vast majority of xiaomi phones, including those in the sweet range of <$200 can use VOLTE calls, but much more expensive branded models like Samsung, Oppo out there cannot use VOLTE calls lol  Am thinking of porting my zero1 to a cheaper plan so as to save $$$ every month and depend on TPG as main driver for data."
5,"It's FREE (for now), with unlimited data! What more can you ask for?! Connection is spotty at best, but you get unlimited data when you go to Malaysia. Highly recommend!!!"
4,"When I applied for this, TPG was letting this be free of charge (how much better can it get!), and generous with max 4G speed of daily up to 2GB,and any excess will just be at 3G speed.  The only factor why I don't give five stars, is because it seems in places like underground or secluded areas including while trying to use Google map while in tunnels, the reception becomes weak (and I checked with my M1 data plan, which has no issue in the same areas). "
5,"I apply TPG on January 2019 and for sometime used it as my backup data usage. Due to launching, it give free data for 1 year and since july 2019 give free roaming to malaysia+indonesia. I used it to indonesia, and the speed was good in my opinion.  The signal very weak when used inside underground, so for now don't rely when using MRT. But when outside in the open, signal was good and good enough for me.  TPG is good due to free of charge during promotion and free roaming to neighboring country.  I hope to hear more from TPG in the future."
3,"ok data coverage as no signal underground for most areas,will see how call quality as time comes and hope roaming works too"
5,"I signed up with TPG for their 12 months free mobile data package.  Sign up & Collection: 5 stars The process is easy, can be done totally online. The sim card can be collected at 4 of the Hua Wei outlets. I selected the West Gate as it is very near my place. I went there during weekday 6+ pm, Not many people there and I only needed to wait a few minutes.  It is a 3-in-1 sim card that can be fitted into Nano, Micro or Standard Sim Card slots.  Usage: 4 stars There are two catches you will need to take note of: 4G data is only limited to 2GB per day, exceeding that your connection will be downgraded to 3G. Only certain phone models support voice calls, refers to their web site for the phone listing, sadly iPhones are not supported for voice call,  Network Coverage: 4 stars I am able to receive the coverage a few hundred metres before reaching the Tua Checkpoint. Recently it supported free data roaming at Malaysia and Indonesia too at 1 MB/s speed. Tested and worked on my iPhone 6S. The coverage was not good when it went into MRT tunnels or expressway tunnels, Once the coverage was lost, my phone cannot detect the sim card, I have to take out and reinsert the sim card to activate the coverage. I've a feeling the sim card is not too compatible with iPhone.  Pricing : 6 stars out of 5 Extra 1 star for being totally free.  There are still some glitches here and there but since it was free, I cannot complain so I will still give them an overall 5 stars. "
4,"I got it for my 7 year old son and slot into an old Iphone 6. Never thought of getting a line for the child but since it is free , thought I'd use it as a trial to see if it'd be useful to keep him contactable via Whats App.  Alot of data available. I think 2GB per day limit? That's alot!!  So far so good."
3,"So happy to get a new TPG provided here.  However, I got a new sim card but fail to activate in Samsung Note 4. what we should do?"
5,The internet speed is faster than Starhub in my house area! The free internet is so helpful when my wifi modem is down for one week. Free 2gb per day saved my life 
4,"Free 2 years mobile plan. No calls but there is free sms. However network sometimes is quite hard to get in mrt and underground. Overall data usage is good, and you can use it in Malaysia and Indonesia as well."
5,I have been using TPG mobile for almost 6 months. 2GB a day is more than enough for me. For this past 6 months it has been my main SIM card in my phone. Hopefully when they roll out the price plan it will be affordable. Definitely recommend anyone to try out TPG for free.
4,Got this card for free and was able to have unlimited data at 0 cost. It can be used in Malaysia as well so awesome for those weekend trips to JB!
2,"To date, the signals are still quite weak in certain parts of Singapore, e.g. Tenah Merah Ferry Terminal. There is totally no signals when you are underground most of the times.   Tried out the signal in Malaysia and it is terrible. You hardly get any signals except nearby customs or City Square; not really strong too. They are partnering with YES telcom.   You are unable to make phone calls unless you are using a specific phones that supports VoLTE.   They are in the testing phase and its free for now henceforth, its kind of expected. "
2,"Tpg line is so weak when you are travelling underground and staff doesn't explain clearly. Service is too poor, need improvement."
2,The line can't be use underground and had difficulty using it. Always cannot use my hotspots staffs did not explain well in details.. 
4,"Reception is good, recommended. Customer service was helpful and efficient, pleased with service. Been using for a year"
4,Sign up is very quick plus you get it for free. I use it for my ipad instead of my phone and so far the connection is great. What more can you ask. :D
1,"I brought the card the day before I go to Malaysia, and specific ask the staff if can use in Malaysia as it state 24 hr prior, the staff told me can. Next day I ended up with no Data in Malaysia as the SIM card cannot be connected.  My friends who have the SIM before also can't connect to use, connection is really bad.  So she also ended up without Data.  while some can't even upload photos and connection is on and off not stable at all.    we ended up no Data for our mobile.  really angry and useless ....."
1,"Me and a friend signed up hoping to use the free data use in Indonesia but only his SIM worked when we were in Medan. Also, my sister's free TPG SIM doesn't work in KL. "
5,"Sign up online was quick. Confirmation email came almost instantly. And the collection at Challenger Jurong Point was also speedy, with efficient and polite staff attending.  There was a nice lady who asked people in the queue to get ready the IC. Although the email says to bring the email and utility bill to show address, for Singaporeans, the IC will do. The service, I would say, is highly efficient. There is no need to sign anything during the collection. "
3,TPG said unlimited data coverage in Malaysia and Indonesia but... Unfortunately there is totally no signal in Indonesia and as for in Malaysia the coverage is very weak. 
3,"It goes to zero signal in the mrt atleast that was consistently my experience in the downtown lines, in all stations.  I can accept that since its free for 12 months. Useful for people who travel to my and id. However the expetience of non signal in SG's mrt gives me alot of doubt of their reliability, would be a concern especially during travel when data connection is very important for navigation, etc. "
4,"Free for now , but judging for the price for unlimited data, I am more than willing to pay for it. Connection underground is weak but will give it time to strengthen the signals"
4,"quite good. no data in underground mrt, and sometimes inside buildings. the mobile speed (4G) is comparable to Singtel 3G speed, tested with speedtest. Tried the free data roaming in Malaysia through their partner Yes 4G. it was quite slow for me, but my friends who had tried did not feel that it is slow. not sure why."
4,Pretty stable data especially it is free of charge now.  The only down side is we can't make or received phone call yet.  
4,"Haven't tried it in JB yet, but hope to try it soon. I had TPG for a couple of months now, and use it mostly for the data. It's actually very fast above ground (i've stopped trying it underground so not sure if it works now). All in, it's a rather stable provider and I look forward to it developing into a worthy competitor of the other telcos! Note that I haven't tried to call using it so wouldn't be able to comment on that. "
1,"I have applied for a Free 12 month TPG plan, but I find that the reception is not good. The line drop often, it make worst when I use in ""border"" area like punggol, Jurong West, Woodlands Changi end or Tua (which near to the seaside). Overall I very disappointed with the line TPG provided  "
4,"Signed up for their free sim card for 12 months with unlimited data capped at 2gb per day. The data connection is lost when underground which I hope will be rectified soon. I also tried to use the sim card with my portable wifi but the speed is incredibly slow, not sure if the telcom deliberately slow it down or is it the settings of my portable wifi. Won't complain much since it's free."
5," APPLICATION?  Application process via online is seamless and easy. You can complete the process in less than 5minutes.   ADDITIONAL SIM? Thinking of getting additional sim for work related or for someone else? Look no further. Under one NRIC, you can apply up to 4 TPG sim-card which can be activated on the same day when you get pick-up the SIM means you get about 8GB data for free. TPG is free for 12months with 2GB fast data and subsequent slower data. Highly suggestible for everyone to get at least one SIM from them. "
3,"Applied for the free 12 months no contract XL Unlimited Data Plan during the initial launch in February 2019 on TPG website.   Application was hassle-free, just fill in personal particulars, upload digital copy of both side of NRIC and I was very surprised, able to choose a new mobile number from a list of 20. Porting service from other telcos was not available during their trial period.   Collection during the initial launch was at Woodlands or Seng Kang. I was amused that the collection address was at the void deck of HDB flats. Collection on behalf of family members or friends was not allowed at that time.  The queue was short when I went to the collection venue at Woodlands. The TPG staff had a tablet to scan the TPG confirmation email bar code, photograph taken of the original NRIC and issued a SIM card. Everything was processed in 5 minutes time. TPG SIM card was activated immediately on the spot.  I am using Samsung Galaxy A7 and sadly, only Data was usable, voicecall on VOLTE was not support for my phone model.   Connection signal and data speed are good for outdoor and in my house in Jurong East. Surprisingly, in IMM, Jcube, Westgate and Clementi Mall, there was even data reception in the basement.   However, for many other shopping malls and underground MRT station, there was no reception.   2GB data allowance per day was more than enough for normal surfing and even after exceeding 2GB, the unlimited 1Mbps thereafter was very usable for every kind of surfing, even for watching youtube on 480p.   Coming to July 2019, there is free roaming to Malaysia and Indonesia. I was able to try in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The phone automatically roam and connected to 'Yes 4G' telco. Though connected to 4G, the data connection was not reliable in Johor Bahru. Data speed was slow but still usable at City Square JB and R&F Mall. I was able to use Whatsapp, Facebook and Google Map. However, there was no data reception in KSL Mall and Sutera Mall.   Coming to August 2019, TPG network seems to be patchy even on outdoors. There was few times in a day that the TPG signal gone and not automatically reconnected. I have to restart my phone to reconnect to TPG network. Initially, I thought was my phone malfunction, but my friends whom were on TPG network faced similar problems of sudden lost of TPG network.  Overall, TPG Mobile still in trial period, I could understand that they are still fine-tuning and rectifying their network islandwide, sometimes mobile signal could be down for certain period.   Hope the feedback I provide to TPG Mobile, could help them to improve in services and enable more phone models for VOLTE calls before a full public launch.    "
3,Currently in their trial programme. Network coverage is spotty in MRT stations and lifts. Can't wait to test out their data roaming service in Malaysia.
4,"Good: 1. Free, no hidden T&C. 2. 2GB daily. So far I haven't hit the limit yet.  Bad: 1. No signal in MRT or underground area."
3,"No data signal in MRT, some building basement and inside building. TPG need to improve. Don't know how is the phone call and SMS as I still using existing service provider."
4,"Free unlimited data SIM for a year, fast enough to stream YouTube at 1080p.  Only downside is connection is 100% lost the moment you go underground. Which is understandable, for a telco that's coming in from Aus."
5,"Pros - Free 1 year (Trail) subscription - Unlimited data (First 2GB at full speed, subsequent at controlled speed) - Strong signal at outdoors  Cons - No signal at Underground MRT stations (for now) - No signal at certain indoor buildings (for now) - Can only make calls on VoLTE network  Would be good if you have a dual SIM Phone, so that you can swap the Internet usage SIM depends on where you are.   Also do not that you‚Äôll have to set up the APN before using (it‚Äôs simple, there‚Äôs a guide given by the staff upon collection of SIM Card)"
4,"FSMOne is the first and only brokerage I've ever used, so I can't compare it to the others. I primarily chose it due to its low commission fees.  Then I realised that if your orders are less than S$11k on each transaction (which mine usually are), you'll just be charged the minimum fees ($10). This sounds really low compared to the the other brokerages ($20?), but FSMOne charges a fee on both buy and sell transactions whereas some of other brokerages charge fees on only buy transactions, so that's one thing to note.  Overall it has been pretty okay. I trade mostly US stocks and the live feed has a 15 min lag time - this might be the same across all the platforms but I can't be sure of it as I haven't tried the rest. Could be a disadvantage if you're trying to lock in a price to buy/sell but miss it.  Anyway, will likely stay with FSMOne for now as I don't see any urging reason to change out."
5,"I have been use FSM for couples of weeks for now. UI is great compare to the rest, and portfolio analysis is comprehensive.   One small issue is the valuation data of stocks, which sometimes doesn't tally with the data listed on SGX. Not sure why but i believe the data on SGX is more persuasive to me, maybe is the lag time between system data updates?  Nevertheless, I would still recommend this platform to new users."
4,Low commission pretty good for sg and hk stocks. But they charge platform fees for unit trust and us stocks they charge dividend handling fees. Good for sg and hk stocks but dont use for unit trust or us stocks.
5,"Easy to use, with a nice app that works very well. Commissions are low too! However, the stocks that you buy are held by them instead of being transferred to your CDP"
4,"A one-stop platform for buying and selling of stocks, ETFs, bonds, mutual funds, etc.  Brokerage fees and charges are competitive compared to other brokerages."
3,One of the lowest minimum commission at $10. Custodian account similar to SCB but there are additional charges when one uses it to hold ETF...  http://kpo-and-czm.blogspot.com/2017/06/ifast-fsmone-is-it-any-good.html
4,"I have used FSM for nearly 10 years when I started to DIY my mutual funds instead of paying for ILP.  Website is the best among all. Modern typography,  nice graphs. Suitable for younger generations, but may be confusing for the elderly. Still have some not-so-intuitive behaviour in their new website revamp in 2017.  Content is the best among all. They frequently produce good articles, product highlights and magazines, which seems unbiased.  Love their dinner and investment seminars too. Think they hold event quarterly. You get to talk to the FSM investment advisors. Not to mention the many freebies collected over the years such as bluetooth speaker!  CONs (only 1):   That said, I ditch FSM because of the hefty platform fees, of up to 0.4% a year. More about that here http://just2me.com/2017/05/08/fundsupermart-platform-fee-is-a-killer/. "
5,"Easiest online claim process I've experienced, and every claim has been duly fulfilled by the Chubb team quickly. Till date of writing I've purchased Chubb 12 times and claimed twice with no problems."
5,"I had two and a half awesome experiences with CHUBB.  The first time was for my trip back to Hawaii. As it was a transit flight thru Shanghai, our bags were supposed to be sent directly to Singapore. Unfortunately, my bag liked the dim sum so much it decided to spend an extra two days there. I had to buy some essentials that were in my bag, and Chubb covered me with a cool $800 for the baggage delay. The second time was when my girlfriend got hit in the head by a surfboard while in Bali. As a precaution, we went to the hospital to check for any injury, and they warded her overnight. The bill came up to $1500, which Chubb completely covered.  When I received my phone bill, I was shocked by the $60 in overseas calls. Turns out Indonesia's roaming charges are a nightmare, and the calls I made to Chubb cost me a bomb. But guess what, Chubb covered that too!  It's not really a company that comes up much when I hear about travel insurance, but after these experiences I've remained loyal to them, and would wholeheartedly recommend them. (It's also really cheap thru the amex website: https://amex.chubbtravelinsurance.com.sg/)."

4,Applied for a travel insurance through DBS for my Euro trip last year 21 dec-31 dec.   Prices can be cheap during sale periods. I paid 60.12 SGD for  travelshield plus which I thought was good value for Eastern Europe coverage  It is overall an easy process online  Did not use the claim (thankfully) so not able to comment on the claim process 
5,Purchased Chubb travel insurance when I went to Bkk last year.  Claim process was smooth and easy. üëçüèª
4,"Cheap and easy to buy from dbs online and can be recorded in your dbs digibank account. Thus, easy for you to reference the type of travel insurance that you have bought. "
5,Used this travel insurance for my annual plan for work. Claim process was fast and easy. Highly recommended. Claimed twice somemore!
5,"Seamless claims experience with PayNow. Unlimited medical expenses coverage. For annual trip, it covers unlimited trips for a year, each trip will be covered up to 90 days.  Suitable for frequent holiday-goers and your regular weekend getaway."
5,Had been buying this for years and it had been a good experience. Best price for saf aviva term policy holder. 
4,Pretty easy to use and good customer service as well. Would recommend to anyone travelling. Have been using this on a couple of trips already
4,"Instant purchase with email confirmation sent. Prices are competitive for short trips, after factoring additional discounts as SAF  NSman or HomeTeam NSman. Pretty decent deal."
5,I love the comprehensive and affordable family insurance that it provides ! It‚Äôs customer service are prompt and knowledgeable to guide me through . 
5,Bought these for my travels. Have been using this company for many years. Cheapest and easy to purchase. 
5,"I always use this product because it gives a discount for Aviva insurance policy owners, which almost every guy in Singapore has. "
5,"Good interest rates, easy to use.  Just need to credit your salary into the account. Great for young adults and fresh grads who are new to working.  "
5,Generally really easy to use. Mechanics is simple enough for anyone starting a savings account. I‚Äôll recommend this for anyone who‚Äôs new to the workforce and trying to get adulting right. 
3,"Was one of my favourite account until my saving goal malfunction.. Basically you can set up saving goals if you have a 360 or frank a/c and the money in your saving goals cannot be withdrawn even though it can be seen as asset. You got to transfer it out of your savings goal before you can use it.   Here's the thing; one day - I just can't move my funds out.  Initially I thought it was a one-time malfunction. Nope, it couldn't resolve overnight. Then I called the hotline who promised to get the IT to check. 2 days later it was still unresolved and no updates at all. I called the hotline again and this time I asked for a higher management who can make some decision on the spot. Before this I had went to the branch and they couldn't help at all so this is the only way I could get someone and nobody could answer why.. I didn't owe them a dime but I can't retrieve my money. It was so bad that they couldn't give me a deadline to resolve the issues and wasn't ready to do anything at all.  Then this smart banker came to the rescue. He asked me to repeatedly login and delete the goal until it is deleted. Once it is deleted the funds will go back to the main a/c. It worked - and also prove how lousy their IT team are (FYI my internet connection is fine). After that incident I heard of a few similar incident from friends and family so I'm just using it for payment because I'm too lazy to re-link all my accounts again. Not for savings - I'll take CIMB Fast Saver any time despite the awkward layout.  Pros: Nice interface, user friendly, availability of ATM (can use UOB ATM twice a month without incurring fee)  Cons: IT is one of the worst I've seen. It took an entire week and more to resolve this issue from their side (Senior Manager called to say their IT got to work after I long resolved the issue without the IT's help) Interest rates no longer competitive."
4,"I used to love it, until the DBS Multiplier comes to the picture. Like Steph Yeo, this account has become a old friend I hate to lose.  Pros: 1) You still earn interest for ANY eligible transaction (pay 3x bills more than $150, spend $500 on OCBC credit cards, salary credit etc). So even if you do 1 transaction, like pay bills, you still get higher interest. 2) Shorter or no queue at ATM. In fact, I forgot that I need to queue anymore at a OCBC ATM.  Cons: 1) For doing similar things, like crediting salary and credit card spend, you get lesser interest than the closet competitor."
5,"Started off with FRANK, found OCBC easy to use and as they market it, no strings attached, no hiding behind T&Cs. Hence it was a no brainer when it came down to choosing a savings account.  ATMs are very easily accessible, probably better than POSB/DBS since the lines are never long + you can draw up to 3 times per month for free through UOB ATMs  Initially did not manage to get too much value from the bonus interests (only got the salary one) due to not being a big spender and preferring to spend in cash (easier to track expenditures). Also did not think that I'd be able to spend >$500/month on credit cards. But one day I got a call from OCBC and they offered me the 365 + titanium card for free, with 2 years annual fee waiver. So why not? That's when I switched to paying via credit card and found that I actually could hit the min spend to gain the bonus credit card spend interest PLUS it helped add that to the bill payments bonus.  So yeah, I'm a really happy OCBC customer."
3,Initially Good for working adults who want to generate passive income when saving up.  But now overtaken by other banks who offer better interest rates.  
3,"Used to be a good product when it first launched, and then they started decreasing their interest rates. If you have more than 50k, would recommend that you put with uob to hit their 50k limits fulfilling their two conditions, and then whatever remaining money to place into ocbc 360 - credit your salary into this account to get the 1.2% for first 70k. "
4,"I‚Äôve been using 360 account for 3years. What made me convert from DBS to OCBC was the queue of DBS atm! It‚Äôs always a Long queue.  I‚Äôm Glad I‚Äôve switched over, lesser queues and increased of atm machines.  Next will be the rebates given by OCBC 360. U have the bonus on salary. And also the rebates when u make 3 giro payments each month. My 3 giro payment are the 2 cc bills and 1 telephone bill. Awesome right?!   Cons...its getting stagnant!"
5,This account can help me earn a better interest rate by simply credit my salary into this account.          
5,360account is a very good saving account for a fresh working adult as by only credit my salary into the account I can earn quite attractive interest every month.
4,About hopefully can do the best services and understanding for the good service Helping the customer for the  good news thank you for your understanding more close to you the service Thank you so much
4,One of the easiest salary crediting account with just one criteria to hit the 1.2%. Interest will be more if fee more criteria are met
5,This account is good and straight forward mechanics. I use this for salary credit account and other expense 
5,"The account I use that‚Äôs gives higher interest just from managing my day to day banking needs. From salary crediting, credit cards spending, saving and even investing with OCBC Bank. A good account overall."
5,"They are very generous about giving out the interest. You will get 1.2% once you giro your salary in, just that simple, if can fulfill other criteria, can earn up to 3.45% pa"
5,360 account is fuss free and doesn‚Äôt require many criteria to earn the interest. It also had High interest and good rewards! Heard many positive feedback and glad to have opened this account for my salary crediting!
4,"This is a good savings account, I‚Äôve been a user since 3 years ago and still enjoying the different bonuses."
5,"Got the decent 2%p.a from OCBC 360 promo every month, much more compared to POSB multiplier. Happy with the rate and service. No catch and straight forward. "
5,Offers great interest for salary crediting as they recently offer more bonus interests for salary crediting. This works well for me as I do not hit all the conditions for max. interest rate
5,"Good start for all the just graduated students. As long you hit the criteria, you will earn yourself the eligible cashback. Always a steady stream of income for the interest. You can earn higher interest with their investment product too! "
4,A pretty good bank account for salary crediting! Earn pretty decent interest of at least 1.2% per annum! Great for fresh graduates
4,"I love the OCBC 360 account for the interests it gives me. However, the catch is that you need to fulfill the various criteria to earn the bonus interests, such as crediting your salary, using the OCBC credit card and investing in a policy with OCBC. One good thing is that they have recently scrapped the requirement of having to make 3 giro payments. "
5,"my trusted savings account. my salary goes in there, i use the ocbc 365 credit card so that my interests goes into my 360 account. i have been using it for 2 years now and it is a good savings account with good interests rates"
5,"You definitely have to sign up for it. It provides good interest rates. I have been using for 2 years already. While the terms and conditions changes from time to time, the interest rates are pretty decent"
5,I was introduced to this by a friend. Offers very good interests. I'm happily collecting higher interests. 
4,"been using this, love the apps, easy to navigate. shorter q at atm, save time when you need to withdraw money urgently. "
3,"Once upon a time there was a surprise in the consumer banking industry, an acc that really rewarded consumers for banking relationships even if you were not high SES. Haha   Fast forward to current day ...  Pros 1) good total banking relationship option if you credit salary + cc spend + investments + online bill payments 2) increase rebates to 6% for dining in oct 2018 3) excellent banking e services    Cons 1) increase spending required in oct 2018  2) I hear of cc wavier being reject(have not experienced this myself)  3) requires 200k deposit for higher interest    I am evaluating to move away from using these services and just put the min sum into the account due to the change in spending to 800 which is quite a stretch.  My primary banking account has already been establish with DBS multiplier that doesn‚Äôt have such high requirements   I would say go with them if you can meet the total banking relationship but there are easier options else where"
4,"Good option for salary crediting account. Although I have migrated to dbs Multiplier, I am still using this as my main account. Love the short atm queue compared to dbs/posb atm"
4,Great savings accounts when it first launched! It has become very competitive when most banks launched such similar products! 
4,needs to track carefully the qualifying amount in order to qualify the addition bonus interest. been using 360 acct and recently promo saver!
3,"Coupling this with the 365 card to maximize cash back and interest return. Relatively easy to hit the minimum requirements for interest returns but they‚Äôve been changing their terms, making their competitors seem a lot more attractive overtime. "
4,"Independent requirement makes things simpler. All requirements can be tracked on the ibanking platform which is a plus! Bill payment cycle is straightforward too, starting from 1st till 30th/31st of the month. Although the money insights can be pretty confusing at times due to them not reflecting the actual cash flow (using external app to track budget and all).  Overall, a good product launch. Hope OCBC can work towards more features/incentives for all!"
4,"Multiple tier approach for a good high interest rate savings account, with just a salary crediting of min $2000 for a interest rate of 1.25% for starters. DBS Multiplier is a new player that conveniently matches this saving account, a few months back."
3,I dislike that they changed their terms and conditions of the interests rates 3 times. Interest rates have dropped substantially and the bank doesn‚Äôt seem to keen to increase it while others are doing so. Not sure how much longer I should stay with them. 
2,"once upon a time they were one of the best offering highest interest rates , but gradually they became very stingy and other places offers higher interest rates with easier conditions to meet. Only good thing left is the user interface. "
4,It is an easi account to earn more interest with multiple products with them. Pay online giro bill 3X will earn u more interest up to 60K:)
4,Used the 360 and 365 combination to get the best interest rate. All is good. But OCBC is very strict on non payment. Forgot to pay a couple of times ans was charge admin fees.. thats the only down. 
4,"I still use OCBC 360 account with 365 Card combo to maximise the cashback I earn despite the competition. I credit my salary to get 1.2% interest instantly. The Giro payments can be achieved by paying your own OCBC credit card or other credit cards and tax giro payments, so it's another 0.3%. Lastly I put my telephone bills on credit card and mostly spend on food and online, where 365 card gives pretty good cashback (3 - 6%) with minimum spending of $600, which is a minus. With this combo I'm earning more cashback on both saving and spending   Another plus is the ATM network (together with UOB) is huge with lesser queues and their popular branches are open on Sundays too."
3,"Was my main savings account before DBS Multiplier account revamped. One good side for this account is that they categorized the interest rate to 3 parts, i.e. salary crediting, 3 Giro and minimum spend of 500 dollars. One can get the interest rate for other categories if he/she fails to hit one of the categories. "
3,Personally i am sad that the interest rate has dropped from 3.05 to 1.85% after using it since 2015. However i may not want to changw to UOB one as I need to spend $500/more per month
4,Realized that most of the people rave about Multiplier account however I am still pretty much a big fan of OCBC 360 account. I fulfill only 1 of the criteria - salary crediting however I seem to see quite a bit of interest coming in every month. So am generally satisfied with this account!
3,"This was the king until our friendly banking neighbor enters the competition.  Last time, 500 bucks credit card spend was the norm.  Now, no longer. Multiplier is the new King"
3,"Was relevant until DBS Multiplier increased interest.   Was a bit troublesome to get 1.2+0.3+0.3 for Salary, CC spend and bill payment, where bill payment could not be done via CC.   DBS multiplier gives the same interest without bill payment, but bonus interest is capped lower.  I have since moved on from OCBC 360 until they revise their interest.  "
4,I am using OCBC 360 and am generally pleased with the interest for crediting my salary which is higher than other savings account. Will continue to use this for salary crediting. 
5,"Excellent savings account for lazy people. Easy 1.2% p.a. for just crediting my salary via GIRO. Bonus of 0.3% if I pay 3 bills via GIRO (also easily achievable). I do not spend much, hence occasionally I get the extra bonus 0.3% if I spend more than S$500 on my OCBC 365 credit card. But I usually heck this 0.3%.  So all in all, I enjoy 1.5% interest p.a. on my balance, without any inconvenience.  I highly recommend this savings account for lazy people like me."
4,"The interest rate not bad. With auto debit on bill, auto credit salary, I'm able to earn around 20 bucks per month. Didn't really count how's it work , but yes I'm recommending it. "
4,"360 - OCBC app honestly requies some sort of revamp as compared to POSB and Citibank. Idea is there, branding is good but in terms of market presence might have to do some tweaking as they are not as competitive as SCB nor as conventional as DBS. Still a very simple saving accounts that most youngster should have!   Their ATMS are of utmost convenience! "
4,"This account made me feel like a boss when i signed up for it after landing my first job in 2014. Absolutely fantastic to know that I'm earning higher interest rates just by crediting income and paying my bills, and meeting minimum credit card spend on some months.   Then the dbs multiplier came along. So now my 360 is really like an old friend that I hate to lose. I've hence kept it open with abit more than minimum for the short atm queues, and when i think I'll spend the minimum amount w my credit card. "
3,"Been with OCBC 360 for close to 4 years but am contemplating switching of accounts already.   Pros:  1. Shorter queues at bank and ATMs. Probably the only reason why I am still with OCBC 360  Cons: 1. Tough to maximise interest rates earned for 360 accounts. Previously it was much easier to hit 3.05%, now even 1.55% is tough 2. Bad customer service experience when it came to waiver of annual fees (I did not qualify for waiver but a CSO misrepresented information to me and told me I had met the criteria for annual fee waiver) 3. Credit cards are lagging compared to other banks in the market"
4,"I opened a OCBC 360 Account about 1 year ago soon after I started working to credit my salary.   Pros:  - Just crediting salary of min $2k gives 1.2% which is not bad. - None of the categories are compulsory, so you can pick and choose which you want to do for the respective bonus interest. - Very easy to open online especially since I was already an existing customer. - Both online banking and app are very user friendly and convenient to use. - Wide ATM network  Cons: - I wasn‚Äôt able to get the bonus interest for other categories since I couldn‚Äôt hit the minimum spend or number of bill/GIRO payments and their insurance/investment products weren‚Äôt suitable for me. - The range of credit cards are not good enough for me.  I have since changed my salary crediting but I believe OCBC 360 is a very good account if it is right for you. My experience with OCBC so far has been very positive."
3,"convert to ocbc 360 account due to initial good rates for interest rates, and also the ease of 'reaching' those requirements to get the attractive interest rate. also including the availability of atm machines islandwide.  salary credit => check 3 bills payment => check cc expenditure  => check easy to earn interest rates.  cons: stagnant n lower rates than initial plan roll out. "
4,"I recently signed up for the OCBC 360 savings account since everywhere I searched for online stated that this was the best savings account.  Here's my thoughts after 3 months: Pros: - OCBC Atms are always available, unlike DBS/POSB so I don't have to queue - OCBC banking platforms are very smooth and the service is prompt  Cons: - In terms of rebates it's not very relevant to my lifestyle and there are not many partners so I rarely use the card for any lifestyle spend - Even after 3 months there are some conditions on ""paying 3 bills"" to get the interest that is still not clear to me, so I don't feel like I'm utilizing the card well enough to get the interest rate  All in all, I'll probably switch account after awhile"
3,"OCBC used to be my preferred banking for the bonus interest, as I think it is the very first to introduce higher interests when you fulfil those salary, giro, etc.   So it also became the first to change it's terms -- for the worse of course.  I switched to UOB ONE Account + ONE Card as the combination is better.  I'm left with 1 damn good use for the OCBC account: Topping up CPF with cash! Strangely, OCBC is the only bank that provide the service. https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Services/others/esvpages/e-services/personal-internet-banking-atm haha share if you know of a better way!"
3,"Pros: great ATM location, Attractive interest rate at the beginning  Cons: lost to competitors, lack of new features"
4,The pioneering product in the market which pushed the rest of the banks to increase their rates or loosen their criteria.  Still very good for those relatively new to workforce after university. ($2k salary after CPF to meet 1.2% p.a.) But right now it's being copied by BOC with slightly higher interest rates. (harder to hit tho)  Good as a current account alternative because it allows cheque book ($10 per book).
3,"Been using OCBC 360 for 2 years plus, just switched over to DBS Multiplier due to easier conditions to meet.  Pros - used to offer competitive interest rates Cons - Need to spend $500 monthly to get higher interest rates - inflexibility to waive off credit card annual fee.  So bye to OCBC soon if they doesn't improve."
4,"Been using this for about 3 years now and pretty happy with it, though I'm not sure how it compares to others. You basically get salary, payment and spend bonuses.  Pros: - ATM readily available and I sometimes use UOB too (first couple withdrawals using UOB are free) - App and online banking is easy to use - I get the spend bonus through my FRANK card, which gives me 6% online shopping rebates (even for grab/uber) that I love, since the bulk of my expenditure is online. Think 6% is one of the better offerings around.  Cons: - FRANK card in recent years came up with a minimum spend of S$400 on offline transactions in order to get the 6% online shopping rebate, essentially forcing you to spend even more on non high-rebate categories (they give 0.3% rebate on non-online shopping purchases)"
4,"Converted to OCBC from DBS since I've started work for their higher interest  Pros: - ATMs are easily accessible (UOB ATMs can be used to draw cash as well) and most importantly, the queue is shorter - Interest rates are higher than most banks  Cons: - Cashback/Rewards on the 365 credit card isn't as attractive/comparable as some banks "
4,"Been using OCBC 360 ever since I started working.  Good:  - One of the better savings account for young working adults - ATM is available everywhere, and usually lesser queue than DBS's. - The app and online platform for ibanking is modern and always improving.  Cons: - Should the credit card be more competitive in their cashback game, it would definitely be a must-have. At the moment, we are all looking out for better cashback cards out there, and it is not that difficult to find one.  Overall, still a satisfied customer of OCBC. Cheers!"
4,"I have been using the OCBC360 immediately after I graduated around 2 years back.  Pros: - ATMs are islandwide, and best part is usually the queue is shorter - The base interest with the minimum $2k salary credit is actually quite good - So far, per year I am able to get back around close to $400 on just bonus interest alone - The web internet banking and mobile app does its job really well and easy to transfer money at no fees etc.  Cons: - The 365 card wasn't very appealing to me as some of the rebates for it was not the most ideal - Hence, I am unable to get the additional interest on this.  - Instead, I am using the BOC Family card which gives way higher interest in stuff like Dining (7%) and Online (5%)  "
4,"Writing review for both MoneyOwl and Endowus. Both are not going to get 5 stars for now and i am giving 4 stars to Endowus for the time being:  1. User interface MoneyOwl interface is very minimal in a negative way because there is no way i can tell the trend of return, current return and long term projected return. Endowus has almost all the basic info you and i need from digital service like this. Personally, i can also observe ongoing enhancement (like renaming goal & changing portfolio) and subtle changes from Endowus but so far nothing from MoneyOwl. However, if you were to compare both MoneyOwl and Endowus with Stashaway, both platforms have a long way to go! I would say MoneyOwl investment interface feels very ""half-baked"" and Endowus needs to simplify the interface.   2. Processes Account opening - I have tried to open MoneyOwl account 3 times (for myself & family members) and all applications were processed in the next business day. I have also tried to open Endowus account 2 times too and the experience was mixed. An application that was submitted later got processed successfully within 3 business days but another application that was submitted 1 business day earlier missed the promised timeframe (indicated on the web). MoneyOwl definitely seems to be more efficient here.  Funding - All fund transfers for MoneyOwl's cash account (with iFast) were reflected in the account within 30mins but it takes 1-2 days to see your fund in Endowus's cash account (with UOB Kay Hian). Once again, MoneyOwl is definitely more efficient here. Not sure if it is a tech constraint at Endowus & UOB Kay Hian but personally, i really like the quick turnaround time from MoneyOwl.  Investment Order Execution - both MoneyOwl & Endowus take 3-4 business days to complete the order. A tie here.  Both MoneyOwl and Endowus are relatively new to many retail investors like me. Consistency and efficiency are really important to gain trust. i had the opportunity to go through the processes multiple times and i believe MoneyOwl performs here.  3. Fee It has been discussed extensively in this forum. MoneyOwl has been saying that it doesn't aim to be the cheapest and it is not a robo-advisor but a bionic platform that provides non-commission based advisors. Personally, it is true that you can reach out to MoneyOwl advisor easily but i must say that i didn't have any problem to speak to anyone from StashAway and Endowus too when i needed advice. So why the higher fee? :)  Comparing MoneyOwl & Endowus, Endowus is slightly cheaper and i like the fact that it offers tiered pricing scheme. I hope both companies can offer referral scheme soon!"
5,Love Amex. Period.   Glad to make it my first credit card as the application was absolutely seamless and the customer service was top notch. I felt taken care of and I knew i could rely on CS for any issue
5,"Hands down my favourite Cashback card. Simple tracking of cashback rewards, good App and web UI/UX and awesome customer service too.  But the relatively lower number of AMEX accepting merchants is a con though."
1,"Pros:   1) First 6 months promotion of 3% cashback with no minimal spend (after that 1.5%), so apply this for Big Hospital Bills / Wedding / Travel to States / Europe etc. 2)  Excellent CS.   Cons:  1) AMEX card is the ancestors of credit card (in the past is charged card) but after so many years, still not widely accepted in Singapore as compared to Visa/master card, so very hard to get cash back in this sense.  2) Basically all other AMEX card will charge annual fee the first month you receive the card, non-negotiable! Bad!"
4,"I love how straightforward Amex is - no hidden terms and calling their hotline is a Breeze. This card is good for those who have a problem hitting a certain amount of spendings every month. However, one thing to note is that the 3 percent cash back has a cap of $5,000 spendings and is up to 6 months (whichever is earlier). "
3,"Good for unlimited cashback and no minimum spending. Customer service over the phone is extremely helpful, not automated voice machine and definitely not outsourced call centre.  However, as this is AMEX card, it is not as widely accepted as mastercard or visa."
5,"American Express True Cashback Card Attractive welcome bonus of 3% cashback on up to $5,000 spend in the first 6 months. Good card for cashback on all purchases and no minimum spending and categories required with no cap on cashback."
3,Signed this card on a road show. It gives good cash rewards and gifts. Most of the vendors accepting this card 
4,"The Amex True Cashback Card is a super low-effort gives you 1.5% cashback on virtually anything you spend on, and there is no limit to how much cashback you can get every month."
5,"Pro: 1) 3% unlimited cashback for 1st 6 mths up to $5k spend 2) Very helpful and friendly customer service.  3) Periodic offers such as $1 cashback up to 10 times contactless payments, $10 off Telco Bills, etc  Con: 1) not widely accepted by merchants 2) not accepted by Shopback Go (yet) 3) Can't top up YouTrip   "
3,"Its really good for the first six months only. However, the only flip side is that AMEX is not really accepted widely by most merchants. Unless you're dining at hotels and restaurants. Beyond the first 6 months, you could consider changing card "
3,"I use this card only for the 3% Cashback for the first $5,000 spend. Otherwise, the 1.5% unlimited Cashback does not differ from the SCB Unlimited Cashback card. Makes no sense for me to hold 2 AMEX cards "
5,"Amex recommended me to convert my Capitamall Amex to this, because i wasnt meeting their mysterious minimum spending to qualify for annual fee waiver.   But all's good since 1st 5k spending in 6 months was entitled to 3% cashback instead of the usual 1.5%. Just nice for me since i was spending on wedding and house. "
5,"The welcome gift of AMEX true cashback is (3% of the first 5k spending, for the first 6 months). This is especially good for big purchases (wedding/photoshoot,BTO home appliances). To add on, apply via Singsaver to get $150 an additional bonus cashback.  For each sub cards applied, you will get $20 capitaland voucher. You can apply a maximum of 2 subs card (means $40 capitaland voucher). No spending required.  Anyone has any idea if AMEX counts you as a new customer again after closing the card for a certain period of time? "
5,"Amazing card, with Low joining fee and unlimited cash back with minimum purchase? Seriously, not to forget the ‚Äúswag‚Äù level when you flash the AMEX card inftont of your peers ;)  Lastly, with the addition of being able to be used on the smart phones, it makes it convenient when pumping petrol or just popping by a 7-11 for a simple drink.  Cheers to Amex"
4,"Used to have the card, though I cancelled it since cashback is not what I am aiming for anymore.  Pros: Fuss free. 1.5% cashback with no minimum spend, which is especially cool when you have low spending for that particular month. AMEX occasionally have good promo so quite a good deal to take advantage of  Cons: Not widely accepted Hard to get waiver"
4,1.5% cashback for all transactions. Most achievable flat cashback with no minimum spending. Very good rates without meeting any criteria
5,I use this card for all my putchases for the 1.5% cashback. Best is no minimum spend & no other conditions. Simple & cashback every month. Just love it !
3,Pros: - Product is good for the 1st 6 months when cashback % is at its highest - Customer service is the best among all financial institutions - Immediate cashback received within the month to offset monthly bills  Cons: - Not all vendors accept AMEX - 1.5% cashback after 1st 6 months makes the card less attractive as compared to other cards
4,"1.5% cashback on all purchase. The pro is that there is no other condition required for the cashback. the cons is that the cashback is lower as compared to other with condition and there are still some merchants that does not accept amex. Since my total spending each month won't meet the requirement for higher cashback on other cards, I stick with this amex card. Most importantly is that it support Apple Pay."
4,"One of my favourite cards. I‚Äôve seen AMEX being accepted by more merchants recently. Like that the 1.5% cashback offsets the current month‚Äôs bill rightaway, unlike most cards where the cashback is given in the following bill or even later."
5,One of the best true cashback I had for the past 5 years. 1.5% cashback with no cap on rebate or min spend required on the card which is unique and different from the other cards I had. The customer service are very helpful and makes u feel like a precious customer üëç
4,"Initial 6months of 3% cashback is good, must make full use of it,  but no accumulation of points.   beyond first $5000, the cashback is 1.5% some retailers dont accept amex.  Cashback of 1.5% there after for any kind of credit card purchases.  "
1,i find it rather useless as it gives mere 1.5% backs. to make matter worse amex is not really accepted in most places. 
4,Clock big spending especially if SC Manhatten card is not offered. Can also use for general spend if really nothing else
3,"Initial 6months of 3% cashback is good, must make full use of it,  but no accumulation of points.   Cashback of 1.5% there after for any kind of credit card purchases.   Sometimes, there are offers that amex offer when using the card such as special discounts on certain merchants. One of the better customer service received from the customer support staff. "
1,"First 6 months of 3% cashback is ok at best, but after that it goes all downhill from there. Similar to the Stanchart Unlimited cashback card, this card at 1.5% cashback is one of the poorest cards in the market. 1.5% cashback on all spending is mediocre at best. At 1.5%, please don't put ALL your spending on this card, even if this is 'fuss-free', as you are going to miss out on plenty than if you had used a miles card. A slightly greater effort on finding the best card combos will give you a much better bang for your buck than 1.5%.  The only thing I can justify applying for this card (which I do too) is the abundance of websites marketing it (as the card is really bad so it requires more marketing effort) and giving vouchers (eg. Capitamall, NTUC etc). Use that to your advantage, apply for the card through those sites, snag the vouchers, cancel the card, rinse and repeat. That's the only value-addedness of this card. Don't even mention the excellent customer service of the card as this should not be your primary reason for applying for a card. Rather it should be the usefulness that drives the decision. And that decision is, borderline no."
4,"Yays  1. Best customer service. Not too many hurdles to get through to speak to an officer. When my line was cut midway through the call, they called me back. Every single customer service officer was friendly and knowledgeable.   2. 6 months, 5k, 3%. Great for large purchases.  3. 1.5% is still not too shabby.   Nays  1. Not readily accepted. But accepted by NTUC! Protip: when in doubt, just paywave with the Amex card. You'll be surprised how many places actually accept Amex. "
3,"Decent card with 1.5% offering, with no minimum spending required. But because AMEX is not widely accepted in Singapore as compared to Visa, it loses slightly to HSBC cashback which has the same benefits. Hence only worth it for its first 6 months promotion of 3% cashback with no minimal spend."
4,"Great card offering one of the highest cashback, with no minimum spending required.   However, not all stores accept AMEX. Will be waiting for the time when AMEX gets widely accepted and this card will be the best to use anywhere, anytime :)"
4,"This is definitely a go to card if you are expecting to spend a large amount of money in the next 6 months to maximise the 3% cashback. Many of my friends who are preparing for the weddings applied for this card to make full use of the cashback. On top of this, their call centers are really top grade."

2,Never heard about Broadband for last 3 years in Singapore.Can anyone tell where will I find this broadband in Singapore.
4,Best of the 2GB line as compared to SingTel as they don't or hardly throttle the bandwidth and gives you the full 2GB that you paid for.  
4,"Just signed up for Viewqwest last Thursday for my new house. Called their hotline to clarify some questions, CSO is very helpful to answer all of them, explanations are clear. Prior to confirmation of my order & issue official invoice, CSO will call again and confirm your order details to prevent any misunderstanding. Email reply takes 1 working day. So far so good. Currently waiting for them to schedule and deliver the broadband. "
3,"One of the cheapest ones out there, partially because they advertise its ease of setup which you have to do yourself. However, I encountered a problem, and had to be on the phone for about 45min or so while they sorted it out. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a rare instance, but it‚Äôs irritating nonetheless. The CSO was very helpful, though. Having said all that, I would go back to my previous broadband supplier (MR), which although costing a little more per month, seems to have more reliable speeds and an overall faster top speed. "
3,"Just ended my 2 years contract with Viewqwest after going with their 2GBps plan. In terms of speed, not so bad as speed test with direct LAN connection is about 1.5Gbps. However in terms of pricing wise, Viewqwest does not reward contract renewal or give any incentive for renewal so for $84 a month, I gladly left them for another provider."
5,"For Referral codes to get $40 rebates, please check this link https://seedly.sg/questions/who-has-any-referral-codes-for-viewqwest?utm_source=question_share&utm_medium=internal  I have been using ViewQwest for years and so far speeds are good and unthrottled.  Hassle free and responsive service team who will even help you when you call at midnight.  Setup is easy and I have been paying upfront annually to get a better discount.  "
4,"Not too bad of a CC if your expenses revolve around petrol, groceries and dining. The 8% cash back is rather generous. "
5,"It is one of the great card to own it as the rebate system makes me spend even more.   As i spend more for petrol and essentials bills, the rebates allows me to earned more at the same time."
5,Wonderful and magical card which allows me to use without worries.  To add on we can get the cash rebates and redeem it hazzle free.   
3,"not so good. has many exclusions like grab pay top up and also insurance. hence I did not hit the minimum 888. may give it another chance next month, see how. "
4,"Generally, pretty good card for me as quite a nos of the merchants that they tie in with promotion are those whom i frequent. Earn a decent cash rebate from my purchases / spending.  And I only realize recently that you get to earn additional bonus cashback with min spending of $888 in the statement month so with proper planning on yout bigger purchase can help you gain more cash rebates."
5,"Best card ever. Been using their Citibank Credit Cards since 30 years ago. They are the pioneers of cashback cards in Singapore - changing from their Dividend card to Cashback card.  Getting cash back by charging to the card. Getting rebates or discounts for lazada, purchases and Petrol station top up too. "
1,"Charged for ‚Äòcurrency conversion‚Äô which I do not experience with other banks, and insist they are valid charges. Will avoid Citibank to prevent any other sneaky charges. =/"
2,"Would have given it 1 Star, but decided not to be so bad.  Charges me interest every month despite me paying up the full sum. I'm guessing these monthly interest was incurred due to leadtime of asking them to rectify the previous error.  Bad customer service, everything is via online, making it difficult for me to commute when problems arises. Send a few emails through my account asking them to call back, but received none. Instead, got tons of calls from their marketing dept promiting their loans n other services üòë  For the cashback, was told we need to accumate 50 points before we can redeem it out. Have been using it very frequent, but the cashback % was so low that i am only reaching 30 points. Not a good system imo.üëé  There are better cashback cards out there. Get those instead"
3,"I use this card on Apple Pay only as it offer 5% cash back. Occasionally, Citibank will offer additional discount or free goodie at fair like Natas, Philips sales etc."
3,"An average card. Not very generous with their points, but there are a huge variety of merchants available. Not sure if other banks, but the app for Citibank is pretty good. They also allow you to offset certain transactions made with your points available immediately! "
4,"Easy to use, no frills cash back card with no minimum spend. However, Standard Chartered's billing cycle is shorter than other major banks. "
3,"Generally decent cash back, but mostly worth it if you spend in larger amounts ($700 & above). The credit billing cycle is also rather confusing to locate in-app as well.   But, I‚Äôll still use it for occasional bigger ticket items.  "
5,Great card with no minimum spend required! Easy to waive the annual fees too. Lots of partner merchant promo too.
1,"Pros:   1) Copy Cat of Amex True Cashback card at 1.5% cash back with no limit and no min spend,  so apply this for Big Hospital Bills / Wedding / Travel to States / Europe etc etc.   No other benefits do I find. "
4,"Easy to use, and good for a secondary card. No frills and works for almost anything - I use it to purchase Facebook ads on my side gig, since costs vary from month-to-month."
5,"The card that I settle down on to use for most purchases. No minimum purchases required, no concierge fee when using honest bee + other perks for being standard chartered customer (15% off some online merchants) so to me it is one of the most direct card to use on top of the savings."
4,"Very high cash promotions for new to bank sign ups. 1.5% unlimited cashback with no minimum spend, good for low spenders who don‚Äôt have to fulfil different category spendings. Hassle free!"
5,One of the highest Cashback card with no minimum spend. Riding on MasterCard makes the product better than it‚Äôs competitor awarding the same 1.5%.
5,Great card with 1.5% cashback on all spending with no cap and minimum spending. Deserves a space in my wallet.
5,Loving th 1.5% cashback on any spending. The cashback will benefit us in terms of off setting the amount spent
3,"Okay, so 1.5% doesn‚Äôt sound impressive. But most cashback cards require that you fulfil their minimum spending requirements before they‚Äôll grudgingly hand over the rebates, and even so, there‚Äôs a limit to how much you can receive. "
5,The unlimited cash back feature helped me earned a lot of cashback which in turn allowed me to purchase more stuff.
5,Love the 1.5% cashback from this card! Very attractive. Signed up during IT show and was given attractive gifts 
5,"Love this card, I‚Äôve been using it as my main credit card as it gives 1.5% cash back in all spending. "
5,"not sure if the promo is still on, but great sign up bonus (250$ total cash). would recommend just for that! "
5,"This is the only card you need.  1.5% cashback, without minimum spending and no cap.   Save the hassle of thinking which card to use."
4,Good card to use with its 1.5% cash back on all products. One of the most fairly straightforward cards to plan expenditure.  Currently using it!! 
4,"A card with no minimum spending - great for people who doesn‚Äôt like to keep track on spending! 1.5% is better than nothing. Go for it, if u dislike administrative matters"
5,Best cashback card in the market for now with no minimum spendings and no cap. Great for both online and offline shopping. 
4,Simple to use. Low 1.5% for all expenses. There are better credit cards out there but no cap on cashback so it is good for big expenses.  
5,Love my standard chartered credit card. Awesome value. Easy to use. And great promotions and redemptions. 
5,"One of the most straight forward credit card out there for 1.5% cashback and huge lump sum amount (i.e. no need to track minimum spending) beside Amex true cashback. However, mastercard is more widely accepted at restaurants. "
5,The cashback is quite good and it do not have a amount to entitle the cash back so every dollar is spent there is a small percent of cashback is what we consumer alway looking for
5,Been using this card for a while now. The 1.5 % cash back with no min. Spend is amazing as compared to many other cards 
5,Fuss free credit card which offers 1.5% cashback with no minimum spend. It's good for people like me who doesn't like to be forced to spend. 
5,"No frills or no conditions attached to SCB Cashback card on 1.5% cashback, and prefer this over miles accumulation as it is a direct cash discount off every month. Used it to charge ad-hoc high-amount purchases such as air tickets, medical expenses, school fees etc."
4,"I use this mainly as a back up card when some large, one-off, spendings dont fall under any popular categories- e.g. purchasing a 1-year gym membership, large sum deposit. I like that there's no minimum spending nor cashback cap!"
5,Best cashback w no tied conditions at all. Been receiving my 1.5% since I signed up last year. Good initiative since MasterCard is accepted almost everywhere
5,super fuss free and takes the pressure out of you to chase for miles/min spend/remembering what categories have what cash back or reward.. 
5,"Fuss free and no t&cs, best for those who want a convenient way to max out their cashback instead of chasing minimum spends or miles"
5,"Best card out in the market. Including $100 cashback for new customers!! Without any minimum spend. Also, 20% on grab rides!!!!"
4,One of the better cashback cards that I can use daily without any extra terms and conditions. I wished that they can increase the cashback percentage for long term though
4,"Appliged for this card under the recommendation of my colleague as there is no minimum spending required each month. It suits me as I do not have any particular category that I spend on every month, so a ""general"" credit card would be more effective for me. The cashback is really not a lot but at least you will get something back from your spendings. "
4,"Just got this card recently since I switched my main card DBS Live Fresh to DBS Visa Debit while using this card as additional card. The sign up process was very fast, took me less than 2 weeks from sign up to receiving the card.  Would recommend anyone who is looking for a fuss-free cashback without minimum spend / special conditions"
4,"Fuss free, I no longer need to calculate to hit the monthly minimum spending to get the rebates. 1.5% rebate is lower than other CC, but it gives you a peace of mind and I value that. If you accumulate the 1.5% rebate over a year, you can see it actually saves you a few meals. "
5,This is one of the cards I‚Äôm regularly using as I‚Äôm pleased with the cashback. The $138 cashback for first time cardholder was very generous and gave me much good vibes about this card too :)
4,"Free 2 year membership and a 1.5% cash back, And there‚Äôs no minimum spending to qualify. And the promotion of $138 cashback last time was good to use. A good card to use overall. Would recommend for those that don't spend much. "
5,I love and hands all up for Standard Chartered Unlimited cos it allows me to earn my 1.5% cashback on all spendings without any minimum spending . It‚Äôs just the CARD that I can‚Äôt live and love without !! 
4,"Fuss free, do not have many restrictions on transactions to qualify for cashback.  Pro 1) no min spend  2) no cap on cash back   Con 1) Low cashback rate "
5,"It is one of the great card to own it as the rebate system makes me spend even more.   As i spend more for shopping onlines in terms of locally and overseas, the rebates allows me to earned more at the same time."
3,Good secondary card to use once you hit your cashback cap. Not recommended as a first card due to the low  cashback percentage. 
4,"Card to bring around as ezlink rebate and final choice for general spend. It is really fuss free and relieve all the stress of what card to use when you got no other promo.   To me, this is equivalent to cimb saving account."
4,"I've been using this card for almost a year now, on top of the 1.5% cashback, there are monthly cashback for your uber (now GRAB) rides. Can get up to S$50 cash back from your uber (now GRAB) rides a month! Not bad if the promo continues.   Other than that, the 1.5% flat cashback is easy to use for lazy folks like me who doesnt like to categorize expenses to the individual cards - downside, 1.5% is a bit low. "
5,"I used to use credit cards that had many requirements which I always struggle to meet such as min $500 spending. In fact, certain months I missed out by a few dollars and ended up getting little cash back. To add on, the bank may not recognise the transactions on the last few days of the month.  Credit cards should be fuss-free, and make purchasing simple and easy.   This credit card is not perfect, but not too shabby. I use the SCB Unlimited Cashback Card as my secondary card, because my main card is a debit card from DBS which gives me 5-10% cashback.  Pros: 1) Fuss free - Allows you to focus on other important things in life than worry about meeting minimum spendings. 2) Doubles up as cashcard for parking/ERP and public transport  Cons: 1) Low cashback of 1.5%  Who should use this?  Everyone should have this as a secondary card.  Why? Cash back of 1.5% is better than nothing."
4,"Especially great for purchases that don‚Äôt meet the requirements of other cash back cards. Example, education course fees. Courses run in the thousands of dollars. Getting 1.5% cash back on them is a good deal. And there‚Äôs no minimum spending to qualify.  But if you‚Äôre comparing for dining or online shopping , travel... 1.5% cash back is low compared to other cards. Just use it wisely! "
3,There are two face to the coin here   Pro  1) no min spend  2) no cap on cash back  3) no need to track spending  4) SCB has promos during periods that make spending on the card worth while. Example Xmas and New year  5) master card feature can be used for token based acccsss for MRT rides so you get a spare card for transport with cash back option   Cons  1) low cash back rate of 1.5  2) no tie up with banking account for higher interest rate   Overall still a good card to have for large ticket items or if you are just lazy 
1,"One of the poorest cards in the market together with the Amex true cashback card. 1.5% cashback on all spending is mediocre at best. Please don't put ALL your spending on this card, even if this is 'fuss-free', as you are going to miss out on plenty than if you had used a miles card. A slightly greater effort on finding the best card combos will give you a much better bang for your buck than 1.5%.  The only thing I can justify applying for this card (which I do too) is the abundance of websites marketing it (as the card is really bad so it requires more marketing effort) and giving vouchers (eg. Capitamall, NTUC etc). Use that to your advantage, apply for the card through those sites, snag the vouchers, cancel the card, rinse and repeat. That's the only value-addedness of this card. Other than that, nope."
5,"If you are a frugal person like me and struggle to hit all the conditions for enhanced cashback, this is the card for you!  1.5%, no questions asked. No hoops, no frills, just cashback."
5,"I used a lot of credit cards and this is my favourite and most used card!  Why? No minimum spending, 1.5% cashback on anything and everything + I can use this for Mastercard Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) - public transport fares also can get the cashback!  Wait that's not the best thing yet! Best thing is the cashback is always credited back immediately after your billing cycle so it can be used to offset the current bill that you have to pay (unlike some other banks which I will not mentioned names, delay the rebates by 1 month)"
4,"I love this because it's fuss free - 1.5% cashback with no minimum spend and no cap. Also the fact that it is a Masterscard, enables me to take advantage of some Mastercard discounts. It adds as a good compliment to my other (Visa) cards!  The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5, is because Maybank introduced a new card Maybank FC Barcelona Visa Signature Card that gives 1.6% Unlimited Cash rebates on all local spend - no minimum spend and no cap. Another good contender to consider!"
5,"This is the card that I use most of the time for 1.5% unlimited cash back with no minimum spending required.  This card is useful for large amount transaction compare with other cash back card as it don't have limit on the cash back you can get.  Other benefit include: - 20% cashback on Grab ride - 1 for 1 dining at some restaurant like Soup Restaurant, NamNam Noodle Bar etc.  You will also get $100 sign up credit and additional $20 for payment using mobile wallet. There is also a promotion on SingSaver where you get $150 when sign up for this card on their web site. "
5,My go-to card for cashback. No minimum spend and no cashback cap - earn 1.5% cashback on all transactions! Application process was quick and painless. Great card for those who don't want the fuss of tracking which categories they are spending on and hitting a minimum spend every month.
4,"Application process was smooth and quick.  $100 cashback when you sign up, $20 if transaction with paywave/apple pay/google pay etc for 5 x within a certain period. Got $120 cashback because of this card!   3% cashback for foreign currency for the 1st 3 months, just nice for my japan trip.  Great one for one lunch deals - Connam, namnam etc. Pretty good deal!   Useful for bulk purchases as there is no cap, although its not the highest cashback card. However, its fuss-free!   Tracking of transactions takes about 2 ~ 3 days. I guess its okay? Would prefer faster though. Cashback received on a monthly basis.   Recommended for those who wants fuss free cashback cc! "
3,"Was attractive to me at first with the free Entertainer subscription. However, turns out to be the Entertainer ""light"" version with much less options. "
4,Good cashback credit card for those who have high spending amount every month. I use it to pay my insurance premium as it gives cashback for insurance premium. 
5,"It is a good cashback card at 2.5%, especially where you spend above $2,000. Otherwise, other cards will be a better alternative to this for smaller purchases."
3,"I only use this card when i know that i will spend >$2000 that month and these transaction doesn't earn > 2.5% cash back in other card category.  Honestly speaking, i don't really like their internet banking layout. It doesn't seems very friendly to me. Therefore i always rely on the paper statement to make payment.  My experience with their customer service officer isn't fantastic, they didn't get back to me on the queries i highlighted.  "
4,"I use this for big purchases, you get more cash rebate using HSBC Adv Card vs SCB Unlimited Cashback. "
5,I have this card too! There is a lot of rebates too which I can use to offset my next purchases. I signed up this card with Bankbazaar and even got $100 vouchers. There are a lot of promotions going on for this card!
5,"This ranks pari passu to SCB unlimited card. However, i can only think of one differentiating factor that pulls you over to HSBC, the $5 entertainer benefit coupled with the 1.5% cashback. "
4,"Yays  1. Effectively the same as the SCB unlimited cashback card for me, because it has No minimum spend! Great for those on a tight budget.  2. No sub categorization for rebates! Fuss free spending :D  3. Gv cards at a steal! I'm only ever free on weekends so $9.5 per tix with the hsbc movie card is as good as it gets for me.  4. There's potential-You can get up to 3.5% if you get an advance account and spend more than $2.   Nay   1. I guess 1.5% is pretty low. But something is better than nothing (; "
4,"My card of choice. 1.5% cashback across all categories, able to buy discounted Golden Village Tickets and have access to HSBC 1 to 1 Dining deals. Until another credit card offers a greater than 1.5% cashback across all categories without a time frame, this is the card I am sticking to now.  <Low spender hence not easy for me to clock $500 monthly expenditure on CC>"
4,Fast speed and stable connection. Customer support is reliable and always prompt to assist. Plans pricing have been competitive ever since new broadband players joined.
5,Great connection and good set up experience. Customer support was very helpful. Download and upload speeds are amazing.
4,Switched over from Singtel 2 years ago and likely to renew my contract. Have experienced minimum downtime and works best together with the Google Wifi hardware.
4,Generally good coverage. Can improve on roaming options. Revised data plans give more value now. Revised family value plans make it less attractive though.

3,I am using their 1Gbps Fibre Broadband. Service was ok but the perks for recontract sucks. Will consider carefully other options when contract is up. Connection speed is generally quite stable so not too much complain. 
3,"I am using their 1Gbps Fibre Broadband. Overall service was good. Connection speed generally fast and stable. But they are not doing very good in retaining their customers, usually no perks for recontract"
4,I have been using Starhub broadband for years. It occasionally has network disturbances but it is acceptable.
5," My family is using the 1Gbps Fibre Broadband plan. The connection is stable with minimal downtime. The speed is fast as well. I've been a customer of StarHub for several years and have not experienced any issues. That said, it'd be good to have re-contract perks. I'd recommend StarHub to anyone. :)"
5,"I'm using the 1Gbps Fibre Broadband plan. It's mostly stable with minimal downtime. The speed is fast too. No issues when watching videos and surfing the Internet. However, providing perks for re-contract would entice more customers. Nonetheless, I'm happy with StarHub's service and would highly recommend it. :)"
5,"I am using the 1Gbps Fibre Broadband plan. So far, the connection is very reliable and the speed is fast. I am satisfied with StarHub and would highly recommend it!"
5,"Switched over to Starhub Broadband late last year due to Starhub cable tv which will cease to exist. Thus, had to upgrade to Starhub fibre tv which requires fibre broadband from Starhub as well. Therefore, made the switch over from Singtel Broadband. Overall, Starhub broadband is pretty reliable and stable with minimal downtime. Speed is decent enough for everyday usage! Furthermore, Starhub gave me a great deal - complimentary (no cost, foc) for 2 years! Highly recommended! :)"
5,I have been using Starhub broadband for the past year. Connection was good. No interruptions at all. Very smooth process. I have signed up for the 2 years package. I will continue to use StarHub broadbands services. Thank you Starhub for the good work. Please continue to keep it up. 
3,"Due to the upcoming ending of the Cable service, I have recently switched to Starhub Fibre as I still want to enjoy the Starhub Pay TV services. They have enticed us to switch by offering a 2-year free 1Gbps plan bundled with the Pay TV. So I am actually paying the same amount as my previous Cable TV subscription with the additional perk of the fibre plan.  As I am still on Singtel Contract so I have 2 ONT points activated for these 2 Telcos. I will evaluate which one is better during the rest of my Singtel subscription.  So far I can feel the Pay TV services on fibre is much responsive and faster than on Cable."
4,The speed is normal and the prcie is a little expensive. But in terms of rewards - it is still value for money.
4,"I am a current user of Starhub, on Jun 2019 I have subscribed cable TV and 1GB broadband Internet to support Cable TV. Initially my broadband cannot support a lot of App, like common Apps Wechat, NEA, Qoo10, Lazada, Grab, Paylah/Paynow, Youtube etc. Only Instagram, 4D/Toto, Facebook and Whatsapp able to use but intermittent, quality not so good. I called Starhub Technical Support and was told that the problem is caused by the router and maybe my phone WiFi. But I told him that my mobile plan can use all Apps and I also try another phone also the same. Moreover if the router faulty why my Cable TV and some Apps can work.  After I lodge a complaint, they send an Engineer to setup my router, after the engineer setup the configuration. Everything is working fine. I am told that my router is too new and need to configure to lower standard to support some ""old"" phone. Unless I use iphone X, samsung galaxy note 10 or huawei mate 30 there will be no problem, other older phone need to configure the router to suit the need.  Now my WIFI is working fine until now. I am satisfied with current speed and stability.   "
4,The speed is normal and the prcie is al ittle expensive. But in terms of rewards - it is still value for money.
3,"My family has been subscribing to Starhub broadband for many years now, since the days where Starhub was one of the only few service providers. In general, the download speed is alright - not much issues watching videos and the likes - it does what it's supposed to do. Price-wise, it's still somewhat competitive other providers.  However, there are a few things that noticed over the years about Starhub that I do not like. Not sure if other service providers carry out the same practice or have similar issues:  - as mentioned, internet speed is alright in general but there are intermittent disruptions that happen at a frequent pace of once a week or so. Sometimes the speed is really slow.  - hard-selling of their cable tv services by packaging it as a ""free"" item when you sign up for internet service then after a period of time, will start charging you a fee for that. When you try to cancel that cable tv service, they'll say that you can but your internet service fee has to increase by like $30/month or something. It pretty much forces you to continue on the cable tv service that cost less than the price increase but essentially PAYING FOR SOMETHING YOU DON'T NEED.  - their customer service hotline is forever busy; it takes almost 30 minutes to reach anybody, only to hear ""switch off and on the router"", which everybody knows how to do. When the same problem surfaces every week, Starhub should pick this up and do a household visit to check what exactly is wrong because switching off and on the router is just a temporary measure. But Starhub never offers any checks nor compensation unless you make a big fuss over it."
4,I recently recontract my subscription line online with my SIM card only with nocontract promo code. It costs me $20 for 15GB (5+10GB 1year promo).  One of good deal offered by Starhub. 
4,"I switched to StarHub 1Gbps Fibre Broadband with Google Wifi back in 2018, and I have not looked back since! There has been minimal issues with the internet connection and speed up to date.  The only problem is StarHub customer service - it is really hard to call in, whether it is during or after office hours!"
3,I use StarHub broadband for few years but had decided to switch to other broadband provider due to intermittent slowness with their Internet speed during evening and weekend.  
3,"I'm a network engineer in Telco industry  I got a Starhub hub package - Pay-TV+Internet +Phone+1Gb mobile data  I would comment that the Starhub service was good - support of IPv6 in addition to the normal IPv4; however, they seem to have made some tweaks recently as the experience doesn't feel as snappy as when I started subscribing, even Netflix over their FiberTV network feels laggy taking over 30s to load.  Will do some tests down the road, but not my priority now and probably will change out once my contract is due to aggregate my telecom services."
5,"I've recently downgraded from homehub to the 1Gbps Fibre Broadband this year, after my home hub contract ended. I've not experienced any issues with the Starhub internet.  I have to praise the customer service team. They have such positive attitudes that it gave me the great impression."
3,"Starhub's internet services have been pretty reliable, and speed-wise one of the best. However, their customer service is pretty terrible. After upgrading my speed, we didn't notice any change. My mother called customer service who kept arranging callbacks, and when they did call back, they confirmed that we were using cat 6 cables and said that nothing was wrong, and those were the speeds that we were supposed to get. This went on for about a month.  When I was able to get to it, it was easy to diagnose the problem as a faulty cable. We simply bought a new cable and fixed the issue. I'd spoken to customer service multiple times, and it was clear they had no idea what they were talking about.  This happened early last year, so things (hopefully) might have changed."
3,"I have been on Starhub since day one mainly because Dad wants cable TV and its cheaper to Hub together. However, since i use the internet mostly for games, I've noticed that I've had more down time than my friends running M1 or Singtel. Also with the recent outage, my ping in games have gone up considerably.   My advice is if you're getting the internet for gaming, think twice before getting starhub. A friend that is on viewquest averages up to 50 ping lower on a daily basis.  One thing commendable is their support team, patiently troubleshooting over the phone and was helpful. However, one thing i hate about starhub is that they dont make loyal customers feel wanted. So it doesnt make sense to recontract at all. You dont get any perks. And in today's climate where no contract plans are king, you dont really combine your plans and hub together. Hence, no need to limit your ISP choice."
5,I suscribed to 1Gbps fibre broadband and the service has been exceptional from application to installation. The app is also useful that I can checked monthly bills stored.
4,"Using Starhub for the past 6 years (mainly due to parents wanted to subscribe to Starhub TV and got their broadband via their hubbing package).  With the new plans changes in Starhub, it is now much cheaper than before. I used to pay $88 per month for their broadband + TV but now it changed to $68, with changes on their channels selection. One BIG caveat is that they do not give a ""free"" router with a recontract, so you can either pay fee dollars a month for different grades of modem, or stick with my old one.  Speed wise, I have no complains since I have a lot of users who streamed videos round the clock and no one complained about slowness. The occassional reset can solve 90% of the settings issue. However, starhub seems to be prone to network wide errors (I encountered once and it's basically at their mercy so have to use mobile data as backup).  Their technical service is pretty good, where they do try to troubleshoot problems over the phone whenever possible. Tried once and had no complains too.  Overall it's pleasant to use Starhub for their broadband, mainly for their hubbing and perhaps larger customer base does provide a larger after sales support. The only thing bad is that their network wide downtime which happens like once or twice a year. "
3,"Been a Starhub broadband customer since years ago after switching to Starhub cable broadband. Service is not the best but definitely better than Singtel which I was on previously.   During the recent switch to Fibre broadband the process was not as seamless as I expected it to be and had to queue for over 1.5 hours at the Starhub outlet. Appointment was made to swap my routers out but the technician came almost close to 1 to 1.5 hour after my time frame but he did inform (though a bit late) that he was having technical issues at another customer's premise.   Speed of broadband was pretty alright on most days, the recent downtime was quickly informed only on Facebook which was a good effort, but it took a while for connection to recover so not many customers were informed. Connection in room is sometimes intermittent with Google Wifi mesh but connection with main router has been relatively smooth otherwise. "
5,"I have been a Starhub customer for over 10 years and the broadband service is top-notch. Do issue with the installation during change of house and speedy customer service. Minor hiccups aside, Starhub broadband service has been great throughout my time as a customer."
4,"We switched to Starhub from M1 and ha‚Äôve been with Starhub for a few years (think we renewed our 2 year contract twice). Customer service is good, although we‚Äôve noticed that the broadband occasionally drops off and have no connection. This happens on some weekdays in the day time. We speculated that it may be them optimising the bandwidth, but have no proof to it. Other than these instances, the internet is relatively stable (we r using fibre broadband). It used to be more stable though, and there are more instances in recent years of us not being able to access the broadband when needed. "
4,"Been with starhub since surf for free days since year 2000, good product even though the there are latency issues at times."
5,Been with StarHub for over 10 years from cable to fibre. We moved 3 times from HDB to condo to landed and each time the transition is smooth. Over the years I have received periodic surprise speedboosts to my plan without additional charges. Setup and connection is hassle free. There are connectivity occasionally but a quick call to the hotline solves the issues remotely. I have switched my mobile to Singtel but am still with Starhub on my fiber broadband for all the reasons above. 
4,"Great connection and good set up experience. Customer support was very helpful. Download and upload speeds are amazing. However, sometimes the connection is not stable on rainy days and will lose connection. Plan pricing is affordable. "
1,Expensive and lousy. Try other telcos instead. I have to keep calling them to rectify my problem. It is also expensive as well. 
5,It provides business broadband access for multiple devices. Offer internet connectivity for up to 20 devices (within 50 metres radius*) with 4 SSIDs (WiFi) on dual-band connection and 4 LAN Port. 
5,"Easy to use.  Call in fast pick up, no need to wait can try it yourself and you will know , everyday use"
4,Fastest telco in town. Broadband reliable and fast speed. Good services and pleasant experience. Popular user friendly 
4,"Good deals to apply it as it will bundle your phone Bills, broadband,  phone for an affordable price "
4,Fast speed and good connection.  excellent customer service. attentive and response immediately to queries. 
1,"I have been using Starhub so many years. Past 1 year till date its getting the performance drop. Always have intermittent connection. Come down always magically no issue and suspect router. Change router to newer model seems issue persist. Notice there's intermittent disconnect. So when play games, you will sure disappointed. End up use 4G better but 4G recently also signal coverage it's having intermittent lagging..  "
5,Actually i used starhub for few years alrd and the connection is quite stable. Their staff is friendly and actually get the job done pretty well.
5,"I switched over to Starhub Cable Broadband after a decade being with Singtel. In this decade, Singtel had never offered to upgrade my broadband speed at a similarly competitive price.  Starhub did, at a lower price to boot. They replaced my 200Mbps cable broadband plan with the 1Gbps fiber broadband plan, at the same price. I also got Linksys router AC2600 when I upgraded. Have had this plan for almost half a year now, and am a very satisfied customer so far."
1,"Broadband works like crap even after the technician came over 2x After the ""Must"" to recontract. REALLY BAD, INTERMITTENT WIFI. Couldn't bring myself to even cancel due to the hefty ETF.  Help me anyone"
5,"To be honest, there are so many remittance agents in the market right now. But after trying out different platforms, I have decided to pick InstaReM as the preferred remittance partner personally for both my personal and corporate use. Rationale is because I like how they take their exchange rates directly from Reuters, which the rest of the providers don't provide. Their fees are ridiculously low as well and their rates are fantastic. (PS: Don't be fooled by those who claim zero fees *ahem* banks *ahem* because they often have inflated rates!)  Time to time my transactions may get delayed at InstaReM (for whatever reasons) but this is common across all platforms as well. What I appreciate is that their responses are very prompt (generally faster than TransferWise) and 99.9% of the time the payment gets sent to the beneficiary within the same working day. This is something very important to me because I wouldn't want my money stuck at the remittance agent for no rhyme or reason and, yet unsure of the status of the transaction, especially when I send huge amount of money.  All in all, I have not much problems using InstaReM but I do hope they can reward their existing users with more promo codes and giveaways.  InstaReM, You have earned my recommendation!"
5,"Compared to worldfirst, transferwise, UFX, XE, this offers the best rates for transferring GBP, and it's really fast as well (1 working day). It only loses to Transferwise in terms of speed when using credit card, since transferwise gets the funds in almost immediately for that payment method"
4,InstaRem is the most money saving Remit service. After I join InstaRemit I never used any other platform to remit my funds.
5,InstaRem is the most money saving Remit service. After I join InstaRemit I never used any other platform to remit my funds.
4,InstaRem is great remit service. i always prefer to send and recommend to my friends . it is also gives best rates
5,InstaRem is great remit service. i always prefer to send and recommend to my friends . it is also gives best rates
5,"I have been using InstaRem for more than a year now and it really has the best transfer rates. Earlier this year they had a SGD1=PHP41 promotion which was really a very good deal. In the past few months they also waived the SGD5 fee for remittances to the Philippines. Even without a promotion going on, InstaRem still has the best transfer rates. My money has always been remitted on schedule and I can track where my money is throughout the process. Their web interface is not difficult to comprehend, although I understand that there can be a bit of a learning curve for those who are not tech-savvy.   Instarem has a rewards system called InstaPoints where you earn 1 point for every SGD100 remittance. You can then use your points to offset an amount on your next transaction, saving you more money. I personally feel that their InstaPoints rewards system is very limited because of low value and expiry, but a discount is still a discount.  In terms of customer service, they do respond fairly well but it still needs improvement. I can see that not a lot of people are eager to try new ways to remit money so they really should give their best effort to improve the customer-facing side of their business. Among the overseas Filipino community many are scared to try InstaRem because they are not familiar with it and they want a physical remittance center where they can file complaints if they have problems. InstaRem should really think of ways on how to gain trust of overseas workers who are understandably very protective of their hard-earned money.  If you are an overseas Filipino who frequently sends money to the Philippines, you can really save on mark-up fees with InstaRem, compared against sending money through conventional banks. You can send your money to any bank account in the Philippines. Whenever I plan to send money to the Philippines, I always check the rates on each remittance platform, and it is always with InstaRem that I get the lowest fees and closest to ""google rates."" With InstaRem, everything can be done on your own time and convenience, without needing to queue at remittance centers."
5,The Exchange Rate is good and transfer is prompt.  Easy to apply and most of all is efficient. Customer service also revert and is responsible
5,"I Have been using Instarem since Feb2019 and I attest that the remittance company is fast, secured and true. Exchange rate his much higher compared to other companies. I will be still transferring on the future."
5,InstaRem transfers are fast and reliable. So far the service is good & rates are competitive. Will definitely recommend for transfers from SGD to INR.
5,"Of all the platforms that provide the service of money transfer, Instarem quotes the lowest fees coupled with a really good exchange rate making it the best value for money. The ease of transfer coupled with the fast nature of it makes it reliable and competitive. Highly recommended."
5,The is totally the best platform to convert money. It's easy to use and offer points and coupon that can be used to offset the admin fees. Sgd - Myr rate is the best among other all other platforms too ! 
5,"I have been using Instarem for quite long. Fully reliable, very fast, and most importantly excellent rate. Highly recommended. Thank you."
5,"Instarem provides the most reliable platform for money transfer. It not only provides the best rate, but easy and fast transaction within 3 days."
5,"Really Instant!!! Surprised to see that the transactions can be initiated, processed and funds got credited even on the weekends, within minutes....."
5,"Best rate in the market, faster transfer and seamless UI. I think, InstaRem have it all and using this for more than a year."
5,"I have transferred SGD to MYR. The process is smooth and convenient, the fund is received by Instarem and send out the recipient within one day (in fact, within hours), and the recipient received the money the next day. I also like the FX alert setting, which can make me choose a suitable date to make the transfer."
5,InstaRem is easy to navigate and offers competitive exchange rates. Have been transferring $$ to Europe to pay for my brother's exchange and everything has been a breeze. Their rates are cheaper than banks some of the banks too!   
4,"Instarem offers very competitive exchange rates compared to the banks and some of its competitors. The rates they use are usually the best. It does offer a rewards program in the form of Instarem Points, which allows you to offset some of the fees incurred.  The transfer time is comparable to most other platforms and takes 1 to 2 business days.  However, the platform isn't as good as it's competitors. For example, to cancel a transaction, you have to contact customer service or let it lapse in 48 business hours and you can't cancel it yourself immediately. Fortunately, customer service is responsive and quick, but it is still a minor inconvenience."
5,Have been using this app from last couple of months. Great app easy to use and track rates. Provides instant money transfer and better rate. 
4,"Usually it will take few hours(Rarely one day) to get money into our destination account. Believe me, now, its within a two seconds, its done today. They improved to very fast. Exchange rate also competitive.  Insta points are like discount, but nowadays it credits very few points and rarely, that's the concern I have."
5,"As an international student remitting money from home (Singapore) to the UK, Instarem is not a bad choice at all! Saved me a ton of money when I was not charged the ridiculous international bank transfer fees. (BTW, DBS has ‚Äúfee-free‚Äù transfers but they still tack an additional margin onto their exchange rates, not very transparent on their part...Instarem was way cheaper.) I would like to alert first time users though, remitting with Instarem takes 1-3 business days, in my experience. If you need money remitted quickly, this may not be for you and will only add additional stress. But for those who plan ahead, Instarem is overall a great service to save a buck!"
5,"I‚Äôm using the instarem for quite sometime. Aside from high exchange rate, using their apps is hassle free. "
5,"Very convenient to use, user friendly and most important, provide a better rate than others. Relatively instant transfer and save up some times to avoid queue"
4,"I have done my research regarding the best transfer rates, and Instarem is the closest to Google. I wish I am able to paste an image of my sheet here. The banks are obviously the farthest, and Instarem is the best amongst its peers - TransferWise, CurrencyFair, WorldRemit, SingX etc."
5,Found InstaRem after doing some research when I need to send money overseas for the first time. The process of transferring through the app was smooth and easy. 
5,"Tried comparing DBS FX rates and Transferwise, wished I found out about Instarem earlier. Instarem offers fast and transparent currency exchange remittance services. Additionally, support was extremely helpful, transferred the wrong amount and called them, CSO picked up after awhile with minimal waiting time, issue was settled with the help of the friendly CSO within the hour and caused zero inconvenience to me. Definitely recommend to everybody looking for a competitive currency exchange and remittance service! "
5,"Compared  FX rate with Transferwise and DBS no fee trsf and found InstaRem offers the best rate.  The interface is very easy to use and once the funds is credited to them, the process only takes 1 working days for recipient to receive the funds.  I'm kept informed that recipient received the funds in order via email. Wld love to share InstaRem with more of my friends, awesome! "
5,I wish I knew about Instarem earlier! The most economical app to transfer money from Singapore thus far. InstaRem offers the best rate for foreign exchange and you can get more if you claim your points when transferring money.   Transactions are also very seamless and I've never experience any issues with them. I have and is recommending this app to all my friends who want to send money overseas!
5,Most economical way to send money (as far as my research goes). Money received the next day to the account in Vietnam with NO hidden fee. You can also set email notification when the rate is good for you to transfer money. Would recommend!
4,"Easy to use, TransferWise offers one of the best rates on the market, comparable to its competitors. "
5,"Awesome! Used it the first time, was a little skeptical and scared. Wasn‚Äôt sure if recipients bank code was correct or if anything could have gone wrong. On the first try I was already transferring $1k. Felt it was a rather big amount for a first try. In the end, everything went through perfectly within 2 days. Good exchange rates as well. Excellent! Will keep using InstaReM!"
5,Good rate and most of the transactions remitted during the same working days. No hidden charges incurred. the platform very well supported by‚Äã the knowledgable customer service team. 
5,It was a hassle free transaction while using the IntraReM. Easy to use and highly recommend to everyone looking for an app to send direct to bank account exchanging money. Definitely reuse the app again!
5,Hello everyone... I am very happy to use InstaReM  This is instant money transfer. Thank you InstaReM.
5,"Competitive exchange rates, money is deposited on the same day. Competitive transaction charges. No problem so far. recommend this to my friends."
4,"Great service, competitive exchange rates, only need to improve is the time for the remittance to complete. Anyway everything is just right for me "
5,"One of the best money transfer platform to use. Super easy, super fast, super economical. They have the best transfer rates in the market The money gets transferred like within half an hour or so. Have been using Instarem since 1.5 years and never had any complaints or issue. "
5,"I used to remit money back to my home country using bank's remittance services which have poor exchange rates. After coming across InstaRem, I am sold on the more attractive exchange rate and the ease of making payment with PayNow for my remittance transaction. The funds usually appear in the receiving bank account after 1 business day which is efficient enough as banks take similar time to do so. I have since continued transferring money using InstaRem instead of banks."
5,Love the way after first transaction (which takes approx 3 days) almost all transactions happens within 2 hours. Very straightfoward charges and you get what is shown in the screen. Never required to pay extra. Customer support is awesome as well.   Thank you Instarem
5,Very straightforward transfer and smooth transaction! I always use this for my mortgage payments and the rates are good every time!
4,"It's difficult to find code of destination bank for registration. But this app has better rate than another one I used. BTW, if you transfer money more than it should be, this will only refund in point which limit to use at 400 points per transaction. I found this is not fair as they should be able to refund cash or shall have no limit to use point."
5,"I was skeptical using a 3rd party service provider other than banks or authorized money changers. Just completed my first transaction and I am so surprised for their prompt support, efficient service, and the BEST rate! From now, I will use INSTAREM only. Thank you for saving my time, money, and my life! Keep up the fantastic service please!"
5,InstaRem offers great rates compared to other similar services. Also InstaRem transfer money to the destination with short period of time. InstaRem Android app is great and it is easy to use. I recommend InstaRem over other services.
5,"Great efficiency, even better rates compared to similar apps. Quick response from customer service. Recommended"
5," INSTAREM definitely saved my time and cost for travelling to money changers for the similar currency remittance rate. it also enhanced safety by introducing online transaction, so we don't need to carry big amount of cash for exchange. Worth to try~ "
5,"Instarem Always have best promotion,offers and rate.now it support paynow as well.money in the offshore bank is remitted immediately. Sign up process is improved remarkably. Referrals give you good money. "
5,"One words, Efficiency. Easy and safe to navigate via InstaReM. You can monitor the rate daily. Live rate even higher than those money exchange. You don‚Äôt need to carry stack of money walk all the way. It is all electronic ally and only take about 2-3 working day to reach beneficiary."
5,Fast and efficient but Not all state in country in certain country can use. Overall good experience. Hope then expand faster. 
5,It give me always smooth and secure Transaction FX rates are always compared to other FX sellers I will always use Instarem for for future transaction 
5,exchange rate is good and remit to my account fast and also customer service and support respond fast.
4,Used Instagram quite sometime. They provide quite a good exchange rate. Will recommend to friends and family. Quite convenient. 
4,Have used Instarem in the past. Signed up for their account online and remitted funds using a promo code. It was quite fast and the platform is easy to use. The rates are far more competitive than most bank spreads
1,Account opening process is extremely painful. Firstly I had trouble uploading my ID documents on their website.   Secondly I was repeatedly asked to provide the same ID multiple times. My advice is don‚Äôt waste your time and go elsewhere.
5,The Best. There only platform that gives the best rates in the world. Wish there was a card so that we can use them at different countries at the rates that is used for transfer.
5,"I have used InstaRem to send remittance for a couple of times so far since registering my account a month ago. I think it offers one of the best rates among the various online remittance services that I have used before in Singapore. Also, I like the fact that the correspondence with the team was prompt and timely. The first time that I remitted money I actually have to cancel it due to some information error provided, and InstaRem was very swift in raising a ticket and getting back to me. I was able to cancel the transfer in the next 24 hours. Also, the Insta points accumulated allow me to offset a small amount of money after every few remittances. I would recommend InstaRem to anyone who wants to remit money overseas."
4,"After see some reviews and search, I try Instarem to transfer money overseas. So far offering the best rate while remitting from Singapore. Although first transfer takes us through bit of a hassle process then subsequent transfers are smooth enough and packed with better rates!   After that been using Instarem for the past 8 remittances and never had any issue.  It may take a bit longer than the remittance from say some Banks but the difference in the exchange rate is worth the extra day of waiting.  Highly recommended.  Thanks to Instarem team for a very user-friendly website and mobile app."
4,So far best rate given remittance in singapore. But we would be much greatful if there was a single charge per transaction. 
5,Simple and easy to use. Save me lots of time and pain from going to the banks and getting rip off. FX rates are competitive.
3,"exchange rate is good but haven't tried it yet, thinking of trying it soon....................hopefully!"
5,"Value-for-money and quick, easy processing of transfer to India or other countries. Mobile App is easy to use."
5,Have been using Instarem for quite sometime. Reliable and gives better rates. For a verified account usually transfer happens within 2 days. Have used to transfer money from Singapore to Australia and India.
5,"Its very fast and effecient way to transfer money, transfers money within few min to your destination account in India. "
5,Very good money transfer Application. Makes the money transfer very easy. Support team is also very helpful.
4,"First experience with Instarem is not pleasant as they advertised. My partner gave me wrong account number. So my transfer bounced back and it took a week for money refund. And if you use promo code, it's gone. However the most importance thing is how Instatem respond to it. They did reply me within a day time frame and it is not too bad. After that, I try again and with correct info details. Transaction happens without a hitch so far. Exchange rate is quite high compared with other remit service."
5,"I use Instarem for remitting to a Indian bank account on a monthly basis.   When I prefer Instarem (versus the local money changer):  1) When the 'Google rate'* has been high throughout the day (as the rate used is a moving average of the day's rate IIRC).  If you can wait, refresh the Instarem page through out the day to see the updated rate (which should rise/fall closer to the live 'Google rate').  If the 'Google rate' fell abruptly, money changers usually offer higher.   2) For regular small transfers versus a huge sum, as the fees are proportional to the amount transferred   Sometimes the money changer's zero fees makes up for the lower rate they offer.  3) Instarem's Rate alert via email is great! I believe there is no limit to how many you can add.  4) To lock in one rate using PayNow & another rate using Bank transfer payment method.  (I have let one transaction expire, because the rate wasn't as favourable).  5) When I need the to remit urgently. After bank transfer, confirmation of deposit receipt is within an hour, sometimes immediate and recently, transfers are within the same day to maximum of 3 days.   * 'Google Rate' = the rate Google quotes when I search for ""SGD to INR‚Äù"
5,"The InstaRem service is highly reliable, high exchange rate and faster transactions. I also notice that InstaRem is constantly improving its service for customers. "
4,"instaREM foreign exchange rate is good. Easy to use. But the 1st time identity verification is too complicated and a lot of my friend already give up before he or she start using ur service. And about the promo code, it require minimum of 650SGD THEN applicable to apply promo code. Some how it is too high and many people cant afford. In general, i will still find this instaREM USEFUL for me becoz i alway travel between malaysia and singapore. "
5,Reasonable admin fee... hazzle free transaction... speedy transfer within 3 working days... competative currency exchange rate... great promo/voucher code for discounts... highly recommend to all users...
5,"I got to know of InstaRem via a colleague. InstaRem was offering a promotion for employees of my company and I thought of giving it a try.   I have traditionally used by bank's transfer service, under the assumption that they are offering me the best rates (compared to other banks). I never realized that I was actually incurring a loss and was paying a lot of hidden fees for the transfer. The conversion rates, I got from InstaRem were at least $30-40 (per $1000 transferred) higher than what my bank was offering.   I love the fact that they offer conversion between multiple currencies and are registered with financial regulators of all the countries they operate under. This gives me a lot of freedom to transfer/convert, and peace of mind.   One suggestion would be to improve their KYC verification process. The instructions are not very clear for document upload and the process is not as fast as I would have imagined. I would ideally expect the KYC process to not take more than 24 hours."
4,"The exchange rate is competitive & the fee is reasonable. Points reward is attractive. Just that it took minimum 2 working days (inclusive the date of transfer), you may consider InstaRem if you are not in urgent "
5,"I've been using instarem for almost a year now and was previously a user of DBS remit. Reason why I made the hop to Instarem is due to several reasons.   Firstly, they offer the best FX rates in the market and are truly transparent in terms of their fee structure. My previous experience with DBS was unpleasant as they sold their product as ""zero fees"" but turned out otherwise and I lost a good $200 in a single transaction.  Secondly, instarem offers promotional discounts time to time to keep the community engage and I really appreciate such kind gestures. It's hard to find other competitors who offer such offers.  Overall, I would recommend my friends and colleagues to use Instarem!"
5,Really good product.   I have been using it constantly for a year now. And I have seen it evolved in consumer experience section.   Now the transfer speed and user experience is quite good.
5,InstaReM is the best exchange service for me to make transfer to oversea with best rate and fast process. Best platform on desktop or app and easy to use. Highly recommended!!
5,"I am using InstaReM over an year now, never had any issue. Last week I made a transaction which immediately transferred into beneficiary account within few seconds and I got the email confirmation immediately.  They offer Highly competitive exchange rates , InstaReM has really helped me making most of my money."
5,"Best app ever to transfer money overseas. Minimal fees, fast transfer and better exchange rate. I always recommend this app to my friends."
5,"Instarem has the best exchange rate for any online exchange platform, it is even better than Transferwise. Also the fees are cheaper so it's definitely worth using it. On top of that, you get to earn Instapoints after each transfer, sign up bonus, referral bonus. All of these can help you to reduce your fees for the next transfer. Best platform in the market! Highly recommended"
5,Tried multiple money exchange platforms. Instarem are the best in term of exchange rate and speed. I will recommended to my friend and use it about 4 times a year
5,Exchange rates are quite good and it is user-friendly. Glad to know of Instarem and I‚Äôm a very happy user.
4,Very fast and reliable source to send money . Not much hassle and provided fx rate is also good.Easy and convenient way of sending money to my loved ones in the India. Exchange rates are always he highest among others.
5,"Instarem is the best in the market. Gives very good exchange rate, speed transaction. Highly recommended. "
5,"InstaReM is awesome. I have successfully transferred fund without much problems, easy to use. Most importantly, reliable"
2,Required a proof of insurance and didn't have one so i had to wait to use the service where other ones do not require one and can do it within 3 hours. 
5,I've been using Western Union to do my money transfers until I tried Instarem. Most definitely a cheaper and better way to send money overseas! Great job with the ease of use and excellent rates!
5,"Have used TransferWise religiously in the past but InstaRem has better exchange rates and charges! My experience was pleasant and customer response was quick when I had a query, only thing is the transfer takes a little longer than TransferWise which is usually pretty immediate, so it depends on whether you're in a time crunch or not. That said, I would definitely use InstaRem again!"
4,"I have used DBS Remit, TransferWise, WorldRemit, SingX and InstaRem before and I love InstaRem the most. I find it the most competitive in terms of forex rate and fee among those platforms. It is also very user friendly with support of mobile app. One thing I would like to see is to provide a new payment option via credit card."
5,One of the best Money remittance I have come across in recent years. Made the transaction hasslefree. I would strongly recommend using this one and with greater exchange rates.
5,"Its my service for monthly remittance. love the quick transmission, low fees and best exchange rate.."
5,"All in all, InstaRem provides speedy and convenient remittance as compared to other agents. Comparatively, against DBS and transfer wise, I will ONLY choose InstaRem. DBS has certain hidden charges on conversion rate and usually takes a long‚Äã period a few hours to credit into the target account. At InstaRem, you can use it almost immediately and it can be done via their User-friendly InstaRem App. An email confirmation will be sent upon confirmation of payment received in the target account. In addition, InstaRem offers better rates than most of the other remittance. Basically, I will only choose and recommend InstaRem to others due to better rate, shorter waiting time, email confirmation and ease of lengthy procedures. "
5,"Tried few other apps before this. So far the best app for money transfer. Easy to use. Good exchange rate, easy & fast transfer process (paynow available), attentive & responsive customer service rep when I had issues previously. Could be improved by setting a notification when exchange rate reach a favourable number (I know another app has this already)."
5,Best remittance by far with the highest rates. Offers alot of promotion and provides excellent customer service.
5,I sent money today it went through instantly unlike earlier.  This also provides a good rate and instant transfer. Who provides more than this. 
5,A service that was very much needed. Fintech companies are here to stay and change the traditional banking and bring more value to the system. 
5,"Before trying InstaRem I used DBS and TransferWise and when compared to these two InstaRem was much better.  DBS has hidden charges on conversion rate and takes upto 2-3 hours to hit the target account.  TransferWise uses DBS account and you cannot put money into it without walking into a DBS branch, if you have your source account in DBS. Plus it also takes 1-2 hours to hit target account. InstaRem is much more convenient and fast and gives a better conversion rate when compared to DBS and TransferWise. And its lighting fast. I click sumbit in InstaRem App and close it. Open email and see confirmation of payment received in target account. Excellent stuff! I would like to echo Travis Kalanik words here on on what a startup should be and InstaRem is all of that and more  - 'Convenience, Time Saved and More Money in the pocket. Great work Prajit Nanu and Team! Way to Go! "
5,Very useful and efficient for transaction. Always assist during complecation or pending transaction. üëç
4,Very efficient with competitive rates and almost real-time remittance services to India. Thank you!!!!!     
5,"I was able to get the 14SGD bonus from Instarem. Although the process takes 3 days,. Plus the rate is highest rate compared to usual remittance services I used.   I hope Instarem will bring back the 0 fee for India. I was able to send twice without fees. Totally legit remittance service but takes a while for your money to be sent."
5,"Hassle free, quick and efficient service! The app is easy to use, straightforward and most importantly the rates good! "
5,"A great remittance service that is Low in service charge, great exchange rate and fast remittance to overseas account. InstaReM app is user friendly. It is highly recommended for those who need to remit money overseas either occasionally or on a regular basis "
5,"Good App. Except for one or two times in money transfer never faced any problems in transfer to my country India.  Best exchange rates, the lowest commission I have seen among all. Worth to use it.   The only thing I am seeing is all the discounts you will get the first time only. It will be better If they give some promo codes periodically also for their regular users not to use other platforms for money transfer."
5,"Good Online Remittance Service Better Exchange Rate Need to More Promotion  I‚Äùll Refer Our Friends.,"
5,"I was able to get the 14SGD bonus from Instarem. Although the process takes 3 days, I only paid 786SGD when I sent my 800SGD to Philippines. Plus the rate is highest rate compared to usual remittance services I used.   I hope Instarem will bring back the 0 fee for Philippines. I was able to send twice without fees. Totally legit remittance service but takes a while for your money to be sent."
5,"I have been using InstaRem since 2+ years, I found best way to transfer money, even same review my friends also shared with me, I sometimes feel proud to refer my friends."
5,"Better the DBS!! Offer ease of transferring funds and also responsive feedback on the money that is being sent over, furthermore the redeeming points help me maintain the fees even lower"
3,Very difficult to create account . But rate is very attractive and better than the peers. Hope they improve the account opening then they can be best.

5, InstaReM is one of the best app I have ever used in providing the exchange rate. Also the other features of honouring the request for 2 days if you don‚Äôt send money is additional benefit to transfer money at good exchange rate always.
5,InstaReM is unquestionably the platform which provides the best rate. The happy path is very well managed. The only issues that happen are when exceptions take place and communications aren‚Äôt timely. When large sums are involved and it‚Äôs time sensitive you want a partner who can support that. Irrespective of the criticism they are the best option in the industry at this point of time.

5,I have tried various platforms. I felt Instarem is the best among the rest. Instarem is highly recommended. It provides better better rates compare to all. 
5,"I have done real time comparison of the FX rates with Bank offered rates or even the other non bank competitors like SingX, but I found the InstaReM rates the best. Compared with Banks it is for sure better, but even with SingX, I thought there was a marginal benefit in the amount remitted after adjusting for the fees. "

3,I have many bad experiences with instarem because of red tapes. Even if I do the same remittance often you keep asking for same proof to justify my transfer.

I will only consider switching back to instarem when all these problems are removed. Best regards. 
5,"InstaRem provided Excellent Exchange Rate, Low Transaction Fees, and Fast Payment Service with the PayNow option.

4,"THE MOST IMPORTANT thing about e-remittance is trustworthiness, INSTAREM is indeed a Trusted platform with better exchange rate than money changer. It saves a lot of hassle also, strongly recommend to use it."
4,"I initiated a remittance transaction to the Philippines under my name and paid the SGD amount (from currency) via our joint account whereby the account name indicates my wife's name first and probably reflected in the transfer to Instarem transaction.  This created a problem during reconciliation however the email I was receiving did not indicate this issue until I spoke with the last customer service officer.  Had I knew the problem, I would have taken the correct action immediately and did not waste time sending many emails.  The earlier officer told me the request for additional details is due to some random audit/check.  I hope your email requesting for additional details will indicate the actual issue and not just a general kind of email.  I will nonetheless continue using Instarem as you offer very good fx.  Thanks"
5,"Better rate , good service ... and safe transfer ... can trust ... The  customer service option is more easy to contact them even during week ends .."
5,Its a faster and money saver platform to transfer money without any worry.. will certainly recommend it

1,Bad experience. Failed to transfer money and it was returned after escalation. No valid reason given for the failure. Tried using my bank and transfer was successfully within 24 hrs 
5,"InstaReM is a very good app as it is easy to use. The turn around Time is also very fast, usually 1-2 days. The rates is also fairly good and accurate. Has been using for almost a year now and is still using it monthly. "
5,"InstaReM is quite helpful in a way that the transfer almost take place within 24 hours. Transferring funds to the family is done with ease.  Had I known this before for other currencies, I would have definitely.opted for this one. "
5,Excellent rates and very convenient to use. And gives good rate compared to other competitors. Highly recommended. I like the point rewards as I can redeem points. I usually use this to transfer money to Sri Lanka. 
5,"Very good product. Best exchange rates in the market. Highly recommend to everyone      . Only area of improvement is to make the transfer straight-through, as opposed to the current experience where users must transfer to Instarem intermediate account first"
4,"I use Instarem for remitting to a Malaysian bank account on a monthly basis.   When I prefer Instarem (versus the local money changer):  1) When the 'Google rate'* has been high throughout the day (as the rate used is a moving average of the day's rate IIRC).  If you can wait, refresh the Instarem page through out the day to see the updated rate (which should rise/fall closer to the live 'Google rate').  If the 'Google rate' fell abruptly, money changers usually offer higher.   2) For regular small transfers versus a huge sum, as the fees are proportional to the amount transferred. S$1K & S$10K to MYR are $4.5 & $45 respectively, as of 25 Sept '19.   Sometimes the money changer's zero fees makes up for the lower rate they offer.  3) Instarem's Rate alert via email is great! I believe there is no limit to how many you can add.  4) To lock in one rate using PayNow & another rate using Bank transfer payment method.  (I have let one transaction expire, because the rate wasn't as favourable).  5) When I need the to remit urgently. After bank transfer, confirmation of deposit receipt is within an hour, sometimes immediate and recently, transfers are within the same day to maximum of 3 days.   * 'Google Rate' = the rate Google quotes when I search for ""SGD to MYR"" "
5,"I have used InstaREM to transfer money to my bank account in Malaysia regularly.  When I first sign up for InstaREM, they have this $10 promo code offer for first timer with a minimum transfer of S$500. This means I only need to pay S$490 for S$500 worths of RM.  They are very transparent with the pricing, and back then when I first signed up, they charged an admin fee of 0.35% for amount <= S$10K and 0.25% for above S$10K but they have revised the fee upwards to 0.45% and 0.35% respectively. The exchange rate is very close to the live FX exchange and unlike a typical money changer, they do have not a buy / sell pricing.  You can earn InstaREM rewards points for your transaction which can used to offset future transfer. E.g a S$10K transaction will earn you 100 InstaREM points that can be used to offset S$1.25 from future transfer. But you cannot redeem InstaREM points and use Promo Code concurrently.  Setting the recipient bank account for the first time is quite straightforward and instantly. After you initiate the transfer, you will need transfer the required amount to InstaREM Singapore bank account using FAST or PayNow. But for PayNow there is upper limit of $1000. Overall it will take 1-3 working days for the funds to reach my oversea bank account.  The transaction can be done via InstaREM web site or using their mobile app.  I found using InstaREM is much cheaper than the conventional way of exchanging foreign currency and it is also much more convenient. So far InstaREM has been very reliable.  Occasionally they will also release Promo Codes and I will try to wait for these promo codes to save on the transaction fees. "
5,"InstaReM app gives me everything I look for while sending money home. Onboarding on InstaReM is effortless. Absolutely user-friendly mobile app. No margins on FX rates, Reasonable fees and quick money transfers to India. The reward points are a bonus - you would want to use the app even if there were no reward points. Strongly recommended. "

1,"Avoid at all costs, not sure how they get such high ratings. Very bad experience from them, bad customer service whom are just parrots reading a script. Funds never got transferred to overseas bank, refunds promised but till date not yet processed (over 4 days).   Maybe good experience only if you are sending INR as mentioned by other good rating posters. For any other currencies, please BEWARE. They will hold your funds for a long time in bank to earn interest and refund you back to your account as and when they deem fit.   Will get MAS to investigate such fraudulent practices."

5,"Instarem gives the best rate possible in the current market, the transfer of funds is almost instantaneous, with PayNow feature in singapore i've been able to transfer funds within 15 mins across to Indian bank accounts, this is absolutely wonderful and super super convenient. Thanks Instarem SUPER HAPPY."
5,"Instarem is one of the best money transfer platforms available. Very cheap, you have a buffer period of 72 hours to initiate a payment. I will highly recommend it everyone. "
5,"InstaRem is very fast and good Fro Ex rates offering  .It is user friendly & gives you flexibility of holding period of 72 hrs. I feel it  is best way  for money transfer, safe and secure,  i am really happy with this service."
5,"Instarem is very fast,useful and secure. Its process is also very smooth and user friendly so I prefer to send money via instarem."
5,"InstaRem is very fast and has good online rates and easy user friendly process also easy transaction. However the fee is slightly high, but overall Instarem is best for money transfer, safe and secure,  i am really happy with this service."
5,I like Instarem too much .. sometimes i see money transfer is almost instant. Charges are also very competitive and exchange rate is also good.

5,"Instarem Pte. Ltd., Singapore provides best ex-rates compared to other banks and remittance services in Singapore. consider to reduce the processing fee if the transfer is beyond certain limit. Now the processing fee is 3 SGD per 1000 SGD. If some one transfer more than 5000 SGD in a single transaction, then the processing fee can be 10 SGD (2 SGD per 1000 SGD)"
5,"Instarem Pte. Ltd., Singapore is one of the best remittance services in Singapore. I have compared many other remittance services in Singapore."
5,"Instarem offers mid-market rate remittance service. Mid-market rate is the fairest price in the foreign currency market. Best of all, the platform is transparent in terms of fees and exact amount received to the recipient. In comparison to transferwise, Instarem is clearly lower for transaction fee. Huge saver compared to transferring with a bank. Banks don't offer mid-market rate which is how they make money from their clients."
4,"Great interface, easy to use and competitive rates. However, recently the processing fee has been increased"
5,Good and if not one of the best rate available for online remittance. It also has the lower remittance fee compare to other websites.
5,"Instarem always offers better rate than others and very easy to use.  Since I first used it, all my remittances are now done through Instarem. Keep it up team Instarem."
5,Superb online Rates and superb easy transaction !!!!!! Nailed It.........................................
5,Best online transfer exchange rates with fastest transfer speed. What more can you ask!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"The Best Rate in town at the tipoffs your finger tip You can do it on the go Highly recommended, used it >10x-  simply the best"
5,Excellent and Fast transfer of money from instarem.....................................................................
5,"Was using bank transfers before. After my friend referred me to InstraRem noticed, instraRem is very fast and providing best conversion rates. From then I started using InstraRem. "
5,"Instarem is fast and trasfers money within a day. Its UX is very good, provides a very good user experience."
5,Was previously using bank transfers to pay an overseas rent and decided to use InstaReM since I was getting charged huge fees. I saved nearly 100 euros on a single payment compared to banks. Definitely recommend it!
4,"very low rate and most of the transaction remitted the same working days. No hidden or extra charges incurred. Yet, the platform very well supported by‚Äã the knowledgable customer service team. "
1,"Small Pros:  1) Since Utilities bills can't earn cash back except a few, this is one of the few to get 1% rebate but really base minimum. 2) Watson sale and cash back for frequent watson visitors! Close door sales exclusive entry.   No other pros for me and thus this lose out to all other credit cards. "
5,My One Card that I cant do without for my daily transactions and withdrawals even at local of overseas . Plus it‚Äôs cashback makes it real bonus esp when I use it at Watson‚Äôs !! 
4,"Used this for cashback for Watson's purchases. it's pretty useful. Initially sign up for the card for all the perks, but I think there isn't alot compared to other cards"
3,"Have been using this card for many years already, extremely good rebates for petrol for SPC customers.  Can be used as an EZ-link card too. However, cashback and rebates in other aspects lose out to other cards.  Recommended only for petrol spending and utilities bill"
2,"Just logged in to see my rebate statement and realised I'm getting 0% or 0.3% for most transactions, even for dining. So many hoops to jump through just to get increased rebates, gonna switch to another cashback card with more straightforward rebates. This card is only good for one transaction per month just for my multiplier account."
2,"The normal saving account for POSB is very low, only 0.05%. Will not consider to apply for the credit card."
5,"This card can earn a better cash rebate at certain shop like Sheng Siong, Watsons and SPC petrol kiosks."
5,"The POSB Everyday Card looks like a plain ol‚Äô auntie card, but don‚Äôt be fooled by its ho hum exterior. It‚Äôs actually one of the best cashback credit cards for cash rebates at Sheng Siong, Watsons and SPC petrol kiosks."
5,"A card that is suitable for my everyday use, from 15% cash rebates on dining, bus and MRT rides, 5% cash rebates when I shop at Sheng Siong and a 3% cash rebates at Watsons. Good card to have overall."
5,"Up to 15% cash rebates on dining and transport Up to 6% cash rebates at SPC, Sheng Siong, Watsons, Starhub, SP Group, Best Electricity, Geneco, iSwitch, Ohm Energy, Tuas Power and Union Power. No minimum spend required Get 0.3% on everything else, quite fare and ok. "
5,"Easy to use , everyday use like usual, use it everyday with nice rewards and recommended to everyone who is using"
2,Not bad good pricing easy to claim good customer service over all good experience will recommend friends
5,Please provide more promotion and cash rebate for online shopping.  Also pls  provide detail e statement portion. Thanks a lot. 
5,Whenever I lose my bill they'll give me quick assistance and offer clear comparisons between POSB and other banks. Been using the card for seven years now!
4,"Not my main credit card but it's pretty decent as I've used for my DBS Multiplier credit card spend. Currently only using it for phone bills as there is no minimum spend on credit card for the multiplier account. Once in awhile, I use it for petrol discounts too!"
5,"My fav so far as I shop in rebates for petrol SPC, Shen Shiong and Watson rebates most of the time. Besides, it also give cashback to my current signed utility bills with Tuas Power.                                                    "
5,This is the BEST card I ever have as it has a lot of benefits and cash back among other cards. The bank has a lot of tie-ups with hotels as well. 
4,"Perfect card for day to day spending with rebate at Watsons, EZ-Reload and Sheng Shiong. This is the only card in the market to offer cash rebate for utilities."
3,"Credits can be earned from spending at Watsons and utilities bills, but not much active new promotions. easy to waive off annual fee though"
4,"simple sign up steps that can be done online to get the card. Used it for ShengShion, Watsons to get rebate. "
5,Love this card as this gives me 5% rebate for shengshiong purchases and some other purchases. Best card for rebates. 
5,"Got this card for watsons since most of my toiletries are from there. Its good when they are having the cashback sales, sometimes 3% or 6%. Able to deduct for purchase as well.  Can see the cashback more for this card than other cards on the market though it may not be the best out there."
5,"It is really an Everyday card. I use it for Watson, to pay my StarHub bills and petrol. Comes with cash back :) POSB customer service is fast and convenient when most of the request  can be done online . "
3,Not my main credit card usage.   I only use for Koufu app to entitle 10% off for my weekday lunch.     
3,Like the SPC petrol and Sheng Siong discount and credit for redeem.   Overall good credit card but hope got more rebate as the internet work is changing.   Still the best.
1,"No, not this card. I see certain pro comments and here are my views: 1) pair with DBS Multiplier You have the DBS Altitude and DBS Woman's World Card to do that, and they both bring benefits that are unheard of in this everyday card 2) Save on SPC Firstly, SPC is a poor fuel, but this is a separate topic. Secondly, you can use DBS Esso card to get 17% savings outright and it's a much better fuss free fuel card compared to Everyday card which requires minimum spending. DBS Esso card has no minimum spending requirement. 3) Save 1% on SP Services Bill 1% is mediocre. Use a DBS Altitude card to pay off your bill and get 1.2 miles per dollar of spending. That's higher than 1%, without minimum spending requirements. 4) All other benefits like Watson, popular and whatnots Everyday card requires minimum spending. If you are going to Watsons and the like which accepts paywave, use a UOB Preferred Platinum Visa and get 4 miles per dollar of spending. Most merchants in the everyday card list accepts paywave, so use the above UOB card and propel yourself to greater rewards.  Conclusion: Poor card, avoid unless some credit card website is promoting it and enticing you with vouchers, then go ahead and apply, collect said vouchers, cancel the card, rinse and repeat"
4,Good card. Started using this 1 year ago. Offers good rebates. Would recommend this card for people considering it.
4,"My to-go card for Petrol and Groceries shopping at Sheng Shiong.  If I have to spend on necessities, I might as well do it in a savvy manner!  Great card for household who owns a car and do heavy duty groceries! "
5,"If you drive, there is absolutely no reason for you NOT TO GET THIS. Cashback 6% on literally everything in SPC, you can buy literally anything and get a 6% discount, on TOP of their crazy discounts? HAHAHAHA so like said, please apply for this basic, blue not so nice design card and make the best out of it. They also send timely emails for you to pay your bills? Amazing?  Cheers to POSB team"
5,"Best card to have it as the rebate system is excellent.  when you spend more, you will gain back more rebate for future spending."
5,"I recommend that u get this card if u primarily shop at Watson‚Äôs (3% cash rebate and 6% when there is a promotion) and Sheng Siong (5% cash rebate). I also used it for local medical expenses (clinic, dental, hospital) as there is 3% cash rebate and as my ezylink card. Most importantly there is no minimum spend!"
3,"Not the best card for day to day expenses, but love the occasional additional rebate from watson.     "
5,I love this card... Been using since many years... Good cash back and I can use for the EZ link card with auto top up too... 
5,I use this card primarily for Cashback at Watsons. Rebates for products that i need and shoo regularly for anyway. Why not :) 
3,"I use this card mainly for Watsons, Sheng Siong and Popular Bookstore purchases. It will be better if their cashback is able to offset the monthly bill. Else i might use the card more often. The cashback for Sheng Siong is much lower than Bank of China, though the cashbank is better than any card at Popular."
3,"Mainly use this card deor Watson's cashback and for installment purchases. Basic card, good as secondary, backup card. I personally don't use it much for anything else."
4,"Well, 4 stars because of the convenience. Nothing exceptionally good, but no complains.   Use it daily as ezlink card. ATM card. Credit card. "
5,Holding this card for years so far it has given me the best rebates as I frequent the merchants tied up with this card! Will continue to support!
5,Perfect card for me because of the petrol rebates and there are other brands tied up with this card too! Have been using for years and will highly recommend to others!
3,"I use it for ShengSiong, Watson & SP because of the 6% rebates, plus point is with no minimum spend.  Secondly, it helps to get more interest rate for DBS Multiplier Account. "
2,"Compared to the Citibank SMRT card, I guess it isn't as attractive - just that it might be better when used at Watsons/ Zalora/ medical bills (I haven't used it for that yet). Also, there's no minimum spending but the rebates aren't as great as the SMRT card. I guess I won't be continuing with this card eventually if the benefits remain the same."
5,I love this card because I have so much rebates at SPC and Watsons which I frequent often! It is one of the most useful card around! Try it!
4,I use this as my daily atm card and to use at Watson‚Äôs for their rebates. Beyond that there is hardly any benefit to the card though. 
3,"This card is good for purchases at Watsons, Sheng Siong and for StarHub bills. However, I may switch to OCBC card for my StarHub bills going forward as there seems to be many deals between StarHub and OCBC. I am also considering to switch my Sheng Siong purchases to Bank Of China card."
3,Good for use at Watsons in conjunction with their Watsons Member card and for payment on bus and MRT under the Account Based Ticketing scheme for Mastercards. Other than these for other categories there are better cards in terms of rebates.
2,"use it at watsons when there is a storewide 6%  i use it as my atm, credit card and ezlink. so i dont have to carry multiple cards  Use other credit cards for better cash back.."
5,"With my Posb Everyday card, I can save up to 6% cash rebate in Sheng Shiong, Watson and Starhub when I needed to purchases groceries and Handphone gadgets. When i am overseas, I will get 5% cash rebate on my spendings. Everyday Card is a all purpose card hence i only need to hold one card now. This is great savings for me."
3,"5 stars for petrol, 1 star for others.  This is one of the best petrol card in the market. And the rebates given dont require much condition.  Just dont use this as your day to day card from rebates. "
3,This card is useful at SPC and watsons. The cashback was good and it is safe to use. It offers discounts quite well too
3,I use this card only at Watson where this card offer 3-6% cash rebate. No minimum spend required.  I used to use this card for phone bill payment but had switch to OCBC 365 as they offer 3% cash back.
2,"I really though this card was good because it offers 1% rebate for Utility bills, 5% rebates at Sheng Siong, 3% at Watson and 20.1 % discount at SPC.  However unless you are using it at these merchants, this card is otherwise quite useless. The measly Daily $ earned can be used to offset your next month‚Äôs bill, however this is not automatic and you need to log in to do so. It doesn‚Äôt automatically offset your next month‚Äôs bill like other credit cards. So I don‚Äôt really recommend this credit card."
5,"I use this card for the rebates, which can be used to offset the monthly credit card bill or be used to redeem vouchers for taxi. Not bad "
1,Not much use except for pairing with my DBS multiplier account and to enjoy the rebate of 3% or 6%(during promo) for my Watsons purchases. Used it as a backup EZlink card too.
3,Ok card for Sheng shiong 6% or SP bill or petrol. Sometimes there are promo then will make it more useful.
1,Hardly ever use this card except when I make purchases at Watson‚Äôs. There‚Äôs 3% cash back generally ‚Äúsmart‚Äù dollars in the card for offset in the next purchase. Or sometimes 6% during promotion time. But I need to shop again at Watson‚Äôs to use the cash rebate which isn‚Äôt ideal to me as I don‚Äôt have that much toiletries to buy. I prefer deduction of credit card bill with the Cashback which is available from other banks. The POSB everyday card also had some Cashback for dining etc but minimum spend was $700 per month and Cashback amount less than other banks. So I didn‚Äôt bother! 
4,"This is a useful card to me because it combines the functions of credit card, atm card and ezlink card. Especially so because i don't usually spend enough on credit card to qualify for max benefits if i were to diversify my spending across different cards offered by different banks.   But i say this right now because i don't drive and therefore don't benefit from any petrol benefits, and I'm also not responsible for groceries at home so the grocery benefits aren't really applicable to me.  Also helps that there seems to be quite alot of dining benefits for posb/dbs cards, their customer service is not too bad, and their app/ website user interface is good. "
1,"Not really a useful card unless you specifically utilise the main benefits of the card. One of the cards that give 1% rebate for SP bill/Starhub  which be achieved by other cashback cards that give 1.5% or miles pts.  Main benefits are 5% rebates at shengsiong 3% at watson and 20.1 % discount at SPC.  Once again if you really utilise at least 50% of the benefits,  its still worth a try.  Also $100 cashback for new dbs/posb card holders. Can also be tied with dbs multiplier for credit card spending requirement. "
1,Pros  1) Good sign up bonus 100 dollars when I first sign up 2) decent cash back amounts on certain tiers like fuel and certain supermarkets  3) interesting promos from time to time like overseas spending   Cons  1) bad for general spending  2) niche spending domains   Overall view: Get it if the spending domains are suitable for your lifestyle. If not give this one a miss 
3,"Personally don't use it much, its a basic card for daily essentials like SPC fuel, groceries, recurring bills."
4,"POSB Everyday Card is as its name suggests: a card that can be paired beautifully with the DBS multiplier account, which credits higher interest (up to 3.85%) for higher spending on the card. Really appreciate the high cashbacks on SPC petrol, which reduce 20% of total petrol expenses every trip to the pump.üëç"
1,Using this card mainly for SP service bill to earn 1% rebate and as a spare ez-link card. Using it to clock one credit card transaction for DBS multiplier account. 
1,"POSB everyday card rebates are targeted for very specific categories. Unless you are frequent shopper at Sheng Shiong, pump petrol only at SPC and use lots of electricity, this card is for you.  Only worth it for its sign up gift of $100 with min spending requirement on first month. Another sign up, then put aside card"
4,"This is my first credit card. For me , it help me to save around $120 (cash back) last time . Not really interesting card , it is quite basic. The plus point is the entry requirement is low , with this card you are able to participate any offer held by DBS Posb. "
4,"THE ULTIMATE PRICE ACTION TRADER COURSE [REVIEW] If you are reading this right now then you are probably thinking about whether this course is worth the money or not, so I'll do my best to make a non-biased or non-sugarcoated review.   P.S. This is a very long review  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ How will the course go:  ‚Ä¢ You will be stormed with new trading concepts and strategies at first, so you may get overwhelmed, especially if you are new to trading, but I highly recommend you take notes. Don't judge the course just yet. Risk management and technical indicators and why it is being used is also included.  ‚Ä¢ After that is the best part, Module 6 is where everything makes sense, like a night turned into the day. You will know how to execute the strategies from top to bottom. You'll realize that the strategies taught are brilliantly tailored to exploit certain market conditions taught in the course. Though I suggest making a better introduction video to clarify traders that they may get overwhelmed, but it will make sense in the end, basically more like putting belief and optimism right at the start.  ‚Ä¢ Next is that you will be shown a lot of trading examples (videos) with the strategies taught, although not all of it I'm not sure why. Rayner explains his thought process which is a really big thing, but he can be too discretionary in some examples but he does explain why.  ‚Ä¢ The final part is where you will be shown recommended trading tools, books, group coaching recordings (I hope there could be more recording sessions shown), documentaries, checklists, or things that will help you as a trader in general  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Will you learn in this course:  ‚Ä¢ If you are a complete newbie then yes you will, you are introduced to the basics by watching Rayner's videos in his YouTube channel, you will get overwhelmed at first, but in the end, it will all make sense and there you are trading with a concept that you believe in.  ‚Ä¢ If you are an experienced trader then YES, even if you don't use all the strategies taught, you can still integrate some concepts into your existing trading plan especially if you are a day or swing trader.  ‚Ä¢ this course is really suitable to all levels, but of course, I cannot say it is for everybody.  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ What I didn't like about the course and how it could be improved:  ‚Ä¢ This is very minor. As a long-term follower of Rayner's blogs, there are topics where you can actually read some of the lessons in his blogs for free, so there are times where I feel that it isn't new to me anymore, but this is only a very small portion of the course, and as you know, the majority of Rayner's content outside this course is for free to leave a legacy to this industry. I do suggest those modules to be expounded further or add new topics compared to the free blog post.   P.S. I won't point out which blogs are those :P   ‚Ä¢ Some of the trading strategies taught aren't in the trading examples, adding more examples would do!  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ After the course:  ‚Ä¢ There are private group webinars which is recorded  ‚Ä¢ You are always free to email their coaches 24/7 to ask questions, yes you are not alone after finishing the course!  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Rayner Teo in the course:  ‚Ä¢ What I really appreciated is that Rayner is very open throughout the course that traders should not be limited on the type of trailing stop and timeframe he uses. There is no ""best"" but the best one for us.  ‚Ä¢ Some traders usually see coaches as a ""Holy Grail"" that if you mirror exactly what they do, you will be rich and 100% win rate, but that mindset is nothing more than a fantasy. Rayner promotes trader independence, and that will really force you to tinker on your personality as a trader to make a right system for you  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Rayner Teo as a trading coach:  ‚Ä¢ He will literally spend more than an hour just to answer all the questions you have in mind.  ‚Ä¢ His answers are with full conviction and would even go beyond the scope of the question to justify the concept in what he teaches.  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ IS THE UPAT COURSE WORTH IT?  First of all, there is no such thing as a perfect trading course, the reality is that there will be people who will like this course, and simply wouldn't, but to me, it is a good investment.   The length of the course is just right and you will not be drowned by modules with very bland and spoon-fed concepts just like some free course that offers 313 lessons that probably won't get you anywhere (yep I finished it).  The module is all connected and they have their purpose  Imagine this course being like Trading In The Zone, it is a complete book, and it's a book worth reading again and referring back to.   So if the course has room for improvement, gets improved from time to time, then even better!  But then it's still up to you, this review isn't perfect as well as I may have missed something in the course, but I hope this review helps!"
5,"I first followed Rayner from his youtube channel and blog and I've learned a lot just from those free materials. I then decided to sign up for the mentorship program and i could say it is one of the best investment i have ever did. From this courses you'll learn trend following approach that consist of several setups like breakout, falsebreak, trend continuation and etc, which market are appealing for trading, how to manage your positions, when to exit your positions manually, how to not get trapped with a false break and many more. And also some of the swing trading approach  He is also always fast to answer any of his students' questions. I've been a student for a year and he never replied more than a day"
5,"Rayner has done us a big favor by sharing generously what he has researched and practiced, and this means less ‚Äúschool fees‚Äù to be paid to Mr Market by all of us.  Now that I am reading some of these trend following books then I realize how beneficial it is to have Rayner simplify the concepts and break them down into bite size for traders like us ‚Äì with great clarity and simplicity.   As a coach, Rayner is humble, hardworking and inspiring.  Like some of you have mentioned, he has never once talked down on his students and has always taken time to answer any question, no matter how basic it is.  He is also very on the ball, as he typically responds very quickly and sometimes even go to the extent of producing a video to answer a question.  What‚Äôs noteworthy is also his personal story which I find it very inspirational ‚Äì all that he wanted was to make his parents proud, and to have people remember him enough to attend his funeral (his uniquely morbid sense of humor :) ) .  But let me tell u this Rayner ‚Äì you bet that many of us in this community who have benefited from your tireless effort to save us from total-destruction will have no qualms celebrating and cheering each stage of your life too, be it your birthday, a new addition to your family, your kids‚Äô graduation and you becoming grandpa one day.   Keep up your good work, and we are all proud to be mentored by you! "
5,"Rayner took me from a loss making trader after I had blown my account 4 times and after I signed up for his Ultimate Price Action Training course, I was able to go through the content and come up with a trading strategy that I used on a demo account for 4 months and in my live account for 4 months which has grown by 35%. I highly recommend Rayner as Forex trainer and mentor. I have subscribed to his YouTube channel where he keeps new content and refreshes price action concepts and plus highlights actual trading scenarios. Keep up the fantastic work Rayner"
5,"Full disclosure - I had signed up for Rayner's Trend Following Mentorship Programme (TFMP) and paid the fees for it, so you can say I am part of his group. But I am definitely not being compensated for writing this review. I am only doing it because I genuinely like Rayner and am learning a lot from him. I first followed Rayner through his newsletters and free training guides, which are excellent in and of themselves. In my view, after comparing the free stuff with the paid version, I do not believe he holds anything back in terms of content, and that tells me a lot about his generosity. But of course, there is a difference in the paid version, and that is in the ""Mentorship"" aspect.  My main trading style is not trend-following, but I have always been interested in it, so I wanted to learn another method, if nothing else but just to broaden my horizons. I had a couple of nasty experiences with trading ""coaches"" and ""mentors"" (or self-professed ones), but I also have had good teachers in trading and other areas, so I tried out TFMP.  Rayner is patient and knowledgeable, and he never talks down to his students, like some arrogant trading ""experts"" who also pretend to teach trading and investment. I was pleasantly surprised that he actually recorded a video to show me visually a point that was difficult to explain with words alone. Having come across arrogant trainers who put students down for asking what they unilaterally call ""stupid questions"", I found Rayner to be a breath of fresh air.  The community also benefits from his detailed weekly analysis of the markets. Even if I do not have much time to trade, it is like a useful overview of what has been happening in the world, told through the charts of the major commodities and indices being traded.   "
5,"Rayner has taught me so much. I have tried so many other courses but have found that Rayners easy to follow style suits me. He is very patient and explains everything so well and in a simple way that makes it so easy to understand.  Not only are his courses and videos great, but Rayner also takes time to answer your emails and has helped me more than he could ever realise.  I will be forever grateful to this wonderful humble gentleman üòä"
5,"Rayner is a good mentor when it comes to Forex Trading, he has supported me all the way from when I started until now. I signed up for his course which is so cheap, quite easy to understand and practical. I am sooo glad I found his website online. Oh and By the way, he replies to all emails ASAP. Thanks Ray."
5,"Rayner is one of the better coaches and educators I have ever seen in this industry.   Here's why:  1) I have spent countless hours watching youtube videos, articles, and ebooks on trading and forex etc. Many of them are surface and tip of iceberg kind. Few are at least average and you learn something. And a rare tiny bit actually teach you something and leave you with ""WOW"".   Rayner is one of those people who does that really well.  2) His explanations are very clear, and I learnt so much just from watching his free videos on youtube and articles on his blog, that when he launched his course on trend trading, I was more than happy to invest to learn from someone who is credible and trustworthy.   Few people can actually teach useful strategies, and also make you go ""WOW"" after seeing their content. Rayner does both very well.  3) There is ZERO hype and fluff in all his material. Being a very data-driven and analytical person by nature, I really appreciate that he goes straight into the meat, and doesnt waste time telling me a whole grandmother story.  Best of all, there are multiple strategies and methods you can use in different chart setups, so it makes it flexible and very practical.  After applying his strategies properly, I actually increased my win rate and started making profits from my trades!  Thank you Rayner, and I'm impressed! :)  Max"
5,I think Trading with Rayner is a perfect platform for anyone who wants to start trading and doesn't wish to get exploited by spending thousands on a course which may not be suitable for them. It offers a very good insight on his ideas on trading how to go about it and if someone decides its the right platform to continue their learning then pay to learn. I also like the after sales support and mentorship that Rayner provides and am currently adopting some of his techniques for my personal trading. The content is a lot and definitely it's a very conducive platform for anyone who wants a foot into trading. 
5,Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support! Rayner is good! Support!
5,"Great stuff!! No complaints! Once you learn patience and have the right strategies in place, you‚Äôll be fine. Great team and mentor."
5,"A-1 course. Magnificent teaching and excellent ideas to enter the market with full of confidence. I made sound profit with proper risk management ,immediately after finished the entire material. Hats off Rayner. Vaazhga valamudan. I suggest you  (who one read my review), don't miss it buddy."
4,"It was a great course for me, after which I did see improved trading results, area I applied from course is the entry triggers and trades management. Rayner and his coaching team are quite responsive for questions. However I barely agree trading should purely based on price actions, while combining with fundamental element is better in my own opinions though. Therefore a beginner with little markets knowledge may not be as a perfect course. Having said it, it is still a great course."
4,"This trading course is very easy to understand, it gives me really deep understanding about the basics i need to learn specially on how to properly read the trend.. Im a new trader with less than a year of experience so im very thankful to have this my first ever investment knowledge in trading it minimize the gap I've been lacking.. I won't go into details because if you do avail it now.. You'll thank me later. Goodluck!"
3,"All are good review, what about those who cant make it? i wonder what is their side of story. =/ i guess we will never know, if u dare to comment bad thing, u will be remove from the group. =("
5,Thanks to Rayner and his course. It really helped me to improve my skill of trading. I learned how to control the risk and keep my money safe. Rayner is also generous to give help to anyone ask him questions!
5,"Wonderful course and Rayner is a super star. If you study hard and take great notes, your laughing."
5,"Rayner is a passionate and hard working guy , he is honest and straight in his stuff . He knows the reality of trading and trying to put that to the clients . I learnt a lot ."
5,I have learned a lot from Rayner and am still learning.  He is great at getting to the heart of the matter.  He nets it out better than anyone.  Highly recommended at any price.  But Rayner's price is extremely reasonable comparatively!  
5,I'm newbie on stock market and I'm grateful that rayner teo provides a straight to point discussion on youtube and on his own site. His works are very valuable and sharing his knowledge unselfishly. The younger generation like me are very lucky to have this man.

The stuff he teaches is goes beyond text book learning and more into the concept of how the market moves they way it does and how you can take advantage of trading opportunities. The learnings Rayner teaches are clear cut and straight to the point with a refresher at the end of each session. Although the lessons are focused on Forex and Commodities market, the lessons are applicable to equities as well. I would definitely recommend TradingwithRayner as your partner in your journey towards successful and profitable trading! The stuff you get are GOLD and most them are FREE! "
5,"I have been following Rayner for quite sometime and he is continuously contribute many great quality and simple to follow free videos and blog posts about trading educations.

I strongly recommend Rayner n his crew ,for those who are new in trading .  All the best Rayner... üåüüåüüåüüåüüí•"
5,"One of the best on line training programs I have invested in. The videos and written instructions are very easy to follow. I have definitively seen an improvement in the way I enter and manage my trade as a result. During the program Rayner was in touch to see how I was progressing. Compared to some of the other training others are offering, the  UPAT course was excellent value for what I gained out of it. "
5,Rayne's video and lessons are very detail and yet simple to understand. I frequently go back to his video and lessons as when I am in doubt and need better understanding of trading setup. He has kept this newbie from making mistakes and walking into pitfalls. I have also benefited from his coaching sessions. I get my questions answered on the same day and even on the weekends. I look forward to his videos every week!
4,Is very good way explanations. Makes clear many concept. Seems like real nice guy too. Came into course on 12 trade losing streak. Doing much better now!!
4,"I find that Mr. Rayner's educational materials and market analysis are concise but have powerful breakthrough in actual trading wars after my having studied them. what i like among others are your thought process in reading markets with focus on basics things like price actions, support and resistance, risk management etc, thanks to which i could find more profitable opportunities unlike my past performances. Furthermore, i feel that Mr. Rayner has healthy values on life and world, and hope that this wonderful relationship will last as long as possible. May God bless and comfort him and his family."
5,"Hello my friend well what can I say Ive been practicing trading the for the past 3 years and in all that time I have never had the success that Im having now. My confidence and has soared through the roof and I look at the market  in a different light now my progress in trading has improved 10 fold. All the other courses that I've invested in well lets just say I could have kept my money in my pocket. Mr. Rayner course is easy to follow and the strategies that he shows you really works, Im glad that I found his course To you Mr. Rayner My Friend thank you for taking the time and to break things down to the laymens level and making trading easy to understand to where the little guy can have success as long as they are willing to put in the time and effort Thanks A Bunch!!!!"
4,"The Ultimate Price Action Trader course is an interesting and refreshing analysis of price action trading that kept me riveted right to the end.  I came away from the course with new insights into price action that have enhanced my understanding of forex trading. Packed with useful info and tips, the course provides value for money for aspiring traders hoping to hone their skills in the market."
5,"What do you want to achieve out of an investment course?  Fast making money strategies, which often result in failure and massive bleed of cash? If so, then i will suggest you stop trading and enjoy your money doing things you are more happy with.   However, if you decide to give yourself a chance to improve your trading strategies and mentality, then believe in this course.   This course teachs you reasonable risk to reward trading strategies, which you can consistently perform according to your expectations. When you join the course, you are not alone, there are many people like you who also trust this honest course and are working hard. A community which u can stay strong with.   The course does not only show u the strategies but psychologically prepare and guide u throughout your trading journey.  If someone tells u there is a path which can give you rewards but you do not have the mental strength to finish the path. It will still end up with failure.   Hope to see you joining this wonderful trading community.  "
5,Rayner's teaching is simple and straight to the point. He teaches both theory and practical aspects of forex trading: the core principle of price action and the thought process of how he trades. He has uploaded more than 150 weekly market analysis videos on youtube now and the number keep increasing. This helps tremendously for me to put in practice of what he shares.  Recently I recommended the TradingwithRayner website to a friend who just started learning forex trading.  And he found it very easy to grasp the essence. I think the contents of this website are useful for both new and experienced traders. 
5,I have first started hearing about rayner when i came across youtube videos on his weekly market analysis at https://www.youtube.com/user/tradingwithrayner/videos  Rayner is very passionate about trend following and price action analysis. He has written free ebooks on both of them which can provide a beginner very good guidelines. He is a genuine coach who loves to see his students excel at their trading. Keep up the good work!!!!!!
5,I admire & honor Rayner Teo for his generosity to share his knowledge on trading for free. He has every right to charge for his mentorship program as he is giving others his expertise in trading he acquired thru various studios & experiences. His teaching is simple & easy to follow. He is a big help to those who strive & struggle to be a  Successful trader. I salute you Rayner Teo. You‚Äôre one of a kind & may your tribe increase.
5,I find you very honest and your training materials/videos are very clear and easy to understand. I'm forever thankful and my fervent hope is that you'll stay with us for many more years. May God bless you a thousandfold for this great thing that you're giving to the trading community. 
5,"Rayner is a genuine coach who has a mission to save traders from self destruction which I think is noble because many trade do blow their accounts. Unlike many other ‚Äúgurus‚Äù, he doesn‚Äôt give signals nor boast the profits/returns. Instead, he shows you his thought process and educate you on the concepts.   And many ‚Äúguru traders‚Äù out there like to boast ONLY when they make money. So, they show you the maximum profit they or their students earn but minimize their losses incurred or they simply go silent when stop loss is triggered. But once target profit is achieved, they talk like they are the best traders on earth which I personally find it to be misleading, despicable, irritating and totally unbelievable (*shakes head).   I like how Rayner does his follow up and selfless sharing. He makes the effort to reply each comment and emails. "
5,"There is no shortage of people who coach others in share and forex trading.   Where Rayner excels is in the thought put into coaching others with short and easy-to-understand videos (demonstrates the thoughtfulness on his part) and most of his content is free. Even for his paid products, he strives to ensure inclusion of his mentees (and that they are adequately looked after).  His methods go beyond just trying to recognise patterns but into why a trading strategy / pattern works and he tries to explain the psychology underpinning a certain strategy.  And because a lot of his content is free, try it and you will know that it works."
5,You can learn to be a better and perfect trader from Rayner regardless you are  a beginner trader or an advanced trader.  Rayner have shared a lot of his strategies in his youtube video and its free. Trading with Rayner is a perfect platform to learn and excel in your trading skill. Rayner you are awesome.
5," I've been trading for many years. Took a lot of courses but nothing like Trading with Rayner. Now I feel more confident when I put a trade. If you want to be a better trader, tradingwithrayner.com is a must."
5,Rayner have the Trend Following Blood inside him :p and he is really good at it! Rayner is very generous to share his knowledge to the community of trend followers :)
5,In learning how to trade there are a Godzillian amount of stuff out there in the internet. On the same token there are also many ‚Äúa dime a dozen‚Äù self proclaimed ‚ÄúGurus‚Äù to add to the equation. How do u know which is the good stuff and which is the fluff? You might probably discover eventually but it‚Äôs certainly not going to happen over night. It takes years to get good. Finding a good mentor is therefore critical and I am thankful n grateful to Shifu Rayner for all his guidance and patience in helping me to become a better n profitable trader. Trading With Rayner site has lots of solid applicable easy to understand information distilled from his years trading the markets as well as the countlesss books and reports from well known research houses. It is definitely an oasis of information and the best part of it is that it doesn‚Äôt cost you one cent! Do pay a visit to his site and discover for yourself if it‚Äôs for you. Cheers!!! üòä
5,"Rayner is the perfect guy for a new trader to learn from as not only does he share his wealth of knowledge in a straight forward manner that makes it easy to understand, he also stresses the importance of discipline and having realistic pnl expectations. Trading is a long term career which requires investment in terms of education and lots of self control. It is certainly not a get rich quick scheme. If you apply the concepts taught by Rayner you should at least be a profitable trader over the long run.  Even for more experienced traders it is still very worthwhile as there are lots of things to learn and incorporate into whatever trading style you adopt.  "
5,"Trading with Rayner is a good website for diffident level of trader. Beginner, advance, expert are all in one group and willing to help each other. Also Rayner is actively upload updated video and it is free.  If you followed this website for more than few years and watch his every single market analysis (it is ""free""), you will notice his technique is also updating and he is willing to share. Although the technique is updated, but if you follow his old technique to trade the current market , it is still works. For example, when I just follow Trading with Rayner, the technique I often hear he mentioned is trade with 20 & 50 MA, but in recent year, he seldom mention this technique (because current way it is even more efficient) and if you understand the way he use 20&50 ma, until today, it is still works and  is free. So the earlier you watch his video, the more trading knowledge you can gain.   The only downside is, do you willing or have the time to watch his every single video  (inculding market analysis which is start from few years back).  So if you watch all his free videos and learn his technique from there, you are able to trade the market and in fact I saw some people posted in the group  that they are profitable by just watching his few video. However, you will need to work very hard as different knowledge is in different video, but knowledge is there for free.   Alternatively, there also have a mentorship  program  which you can join so that you can learn his trading technique in a well organized way, exclusive weekly market analysis, private group of traders and post sales support. I found the greatest thing for this program is you are given a refundable period which you can take back your money if you feel you are not suitable.  "
5,"Well, I‚Äôm a newbei on trading, I guesse I‚Äôm not the only one who experience losses. I almost blew my account & give up this carrer. But my edge to learn doesen‚Äôt stop.I said to myself If you want to invest something that is new.  You should learn first. There is no free when it comes to teaching, facilities and coaching session. Gladly tradingwithrayner changes my perspective view on trading. I‚Äôts a good investment for me. It‚Äôs not a loss, when it comes to teaching. It‚Äôs a good start to trading career. Tradingwithrayner coarse has evertyhing it in. The flow of the market structures specially when mostly traders will call it ‚ÄúTHE PRICE ACTION‚Äù. It is very well explined on this coarse, even if a high school student can learn to  this coarse. To summerize everything that I‚Äôve experienced with tradingwithrayner. I give it a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è  "
5,The youtube videos covering Technical Analysis skill is perfect for beginners. The courses are also very affordable as compared to other providers. 
5,"Rayner offers a tremendous amount of knowledge for  beginning traders, advanced traders and everything in between. Most importantly he invests in the core of what it takes to become a successful trader, You! From building your strategies, proper backtesting and emotional control. He helps traders avoid the most common pitfalls in trading giving you a head start and shortening your learning curve by months or even years. All of this adds up to saving you time and money. Their is a reason his slogan is ‚ÄúSaving Retail traders from themselves‚Äù and man does he deliver! Very happy to be a part of his community and wishing him all the best."
5,Very good rates as compared to other electricity provider. Helped my aunt sign up at roadshow. Sales staff very informative and also gave $30 NTUC voucher. Customer hotline easily contactable. Billing through email. Very good service. Can try. Hope faster reach Pasir Ris!! üëèüëè
5,Customer service easily reached. Provides paper billing i think cheapet than most companies i asked but nvm..i think email more convenient for me. 
4,"Cust care service can be quite easily reached via Facebook and email. Billing is only via email. Bill format is similar to SP easy to understand. Best to sign up during roadsides. Usually,  they will throw in freebies like cash off for first few months and f&b vouchers."
3,"One of the best option to send money from SG to MY while you are based oversea. Easy to set up.   Used to accept credit card payment (can earn miles), but is no longer available. Without the option to earn miles while doing transfer, plus the rate is no longer attractive, will probably not use it again."
5,Made 2 transfers to indonesia. All went well. Support was helpful and fast to respond. Will definitely use their services again.
5," You and your family can travel the world in complete freedom with the comprehensive travel insurance plan, TourCare Plus. "
5,One of the highest entry level miles paying card. Caveat is the 2 years expiry date of the miles which means you need to chalk up the spending within 2 years
5,"One of the better options out there to earn your miles. With a high miles to dollar rate, it‚Äôs the card I would recommend to accumulate your miles with ease."
5,"The UOB PRVI Miles Card is one of the best air miles credit cards in Singapore with high earn rates of $1 = 1.4 miles (local) and $1 = 2.4 miles (overseas). This is all the more impressive considering its entry level income requirement of $30,000.  "
5,Highest miles earn rate. Easy to use and can even use it as a ezlink. No need to worry about the hassle. Will recommend it to family and friends. 
5,Reliable and efficient travel insurance claim!!!! Highly recommendable and easy to claim. Your one stop solution for all travel insurance needs!! 
5,"Using this card for the miles. Got this card because of Campus card back in NUS, it was upgraded and then I been sticking to UOB The deals not so much, but the spend for miles are one of the best with no expiry dates."
4,"UOB Privi offers one of the highest miles per dollar spent for local usage. For overseas usage, while the miles offered is high as well, the overseas fee is one of the highest at 3.5%.  In addition, this card does not contribute to UOB ONE account card spending. So you need to accumulate the minimum $500 spent monthly on other cards other than this. "
5,"One of the must have credit card if you are accumulating miles (Online spending = 1.4 miles per dollar, awarded in blocks of $5).  Anything lesser than $5 use Citi Premier. The best part about UOB cards is that the rewards/points are in the same pool unlike Citi. If you have multiple UOB cards, use this instead of DBS Altitude for general spending.  Oh. I use this card as my ""Ez-link"" card to accumulate miles too. No topping up in advance, use as you pay. lol."
5,"1.4 miles per dollar.   When theres no paywave, and it doesnt fit under online shopping. This is the card to use for miles junkie.  I use it for day to day spending when paywave is not available.   Oh ya dont forget to use this for plane tickets for complentary rides to airport in mercs and complentary insurance. "
3,High general spend local earn rate 1.4mpd (good) High FCY fees 3.25% (bad)  Bad signup bonuses currently. 10000miles for first 2k signups. 
1,"I find it difficult to get the miles. Especially even for their advertised promotions. I had on two ocassions made airline bookings from the UOB advertisements (emails) and clicked through with UOB logo website and yet the extra miles / points were not captured. Despite having screenshots of my transactions, the customer service checked with the relevant departments and said I didn‚Äôt make valid transactions so no extra miles. I‚Äôd rather use other cash back cards that guarantee value instead of this dingdong with customer service. Left a sour taste because I‚Äôve definitely done all the steps required and didn‚Äôt get rewarded for it.  I would use this card for immediate cash discount promotions eg. They had a promotion with agoda and % discount for UOB privi cards which was a rather good deal. But I won‚Äôt use it to collect miles. "
5,If you are looking for miles to spending ratio for general categories. This card is the best in the field.  It also offers the highest miles to expenditure for overseas spent currently (s$1 to 2.4 miles). definitely one of the best miles card at the moment in the market
4,"NTUC Income Travel Insurance has been always one of my top choices for my trips.   The purchasing process was straightforward and convenient on their webpage. They also have an app - Orange travel which allows you to click & purchase.   I was hospitalised with food poisoning when I was in Korea several years ago. I was reading through their policy (again) on the necessary documents they required for claiming while I was resting in the hospital. It was easy to understand with little medical jargon. Especially they will bold certain words to have your attention.   When I returned back to Sg, the customer service (hotline and counter) were very helpful in assisting. The CSO (hotline) guided me where to download the forms for submission. The CSO (counter) went through the documents and ensured they are in place for review. They also provided me with a duplicated copy for my reference.  The down thing is the whole process took approximately 3 months for my claim. It could be due to a higher claim as I was hospitalised and partial of the documents were in korean.   "
4,"NTUC Income‚Äôs travel insurance usually provides very competitive quotes, if not the lowest. Application online is straightforward and doesn‚Äôt take a long time. Haven‚Äôt claimed anything yet so couldn‚Äôt comment on claim process. Overall, worth considering for a piece of mind."
1,"I have recently purchased a travel insurance with NTUC income and had a very bad claims experience.   Reason why I buy: I just went for a trip to New Zealand and rented a car there. Out of all the travel insurance in Singapore, Income covers the most coverage for a decent premium up to SGD 2.5k for the most expensive plan.   Claim process: I had a minor car accident in NZ and claimed Income.  When the incident happened, we re-read the clause and realised we need to incur emergency phone charges if we were to seek help from Income. Their emergency phone charges only covers medical condition. (pherhaps one of the strictest clause in any policy that I know of)   It was one of the longest and worst claim process I ever had with travel insurane companies in Singapore. I had to wait for 14 days for it to be processed, with numerous calls to the CSO after being said that it will take 14 working days (for one operator) and 30 days due to peak season (by another operator after a follow up call).   The claims department only allow me to claim the cost of the repair multiplied by OANDA rate (a fx website). It was despite the fact that I provided them with my credit card statement. Upon questioning the claims department, they said that they only allow customers to claim via OANDA rate and not baded on the credit card bill. It was not even stated anywhere in their policy. The claims officer was also irresponsible and rude. Every email I sent will take 1 to 2 working days for them to process before reaching the claims department. I requested to speak to a higher up with regards to the claims but was turned down.  I have reached out to their quality assurance department but there was no response.  Resolution: I had to turn to MAS and FIDREC for help before NTUC income entertained my concern (within 10 minutes of forwarding the email). In the end, the acknowledge that the clause was unclear and allow me to claim the full amount.  I will not recommend anyone to buy Income due to the long claim process and unprofessional staffs. "
4,Affordable and very easy to apply for it‚Äôs basic travel insurance. Always my first choice when vacationing.  Great for first timers traveling overseas for hols.
3,Always bought income due to its lower premiums. Yet to claim due to mostly safe destination.   All in all the good is basic protection for low premium. 
5,"I purchase NTUC income travel insurance for a trip to Beijing last year. My china eastern flight was delayed for takeoff due to heavy snow. Luckily, the airline arranged  hotel accommodation for us. With the documents issued by the airline  confirming the flight delay, cause and the amount of time it  lasted. I got a compensation of about $150 from NTUC income. The process is hassle free and easy via online platform of NTUC income "
5,"I away get travel insurance from Income because it is easy to apply online and the claim process is also super simple just fill up the online claim form, print & drop it in the self deposit box at any Income office. I usually received payment with 3 weeks"
5,"I always purchase NTUC Income travel insurance. Purchase process is hassle free. And the best part is, the price is competitive and even the most basic classic plans cover loss or damage to personal belongings! This is something that some basic travel insurance plans do not cover (read the fine print!!). I have claimed twice for loss and damage of my mobile phone and received payouts. Claim processes were easy, and NTUC Income means it when they say there is coverage for loss or damage of personal belongings! Will continue to buy from NTUC Income for a holiday that is worry-free!"
5,"NTUC income is one of the most trustable insurance companies. Their super competitive pricing and informative website, made my insurance coverage affordable, swift and manageable. Few clicks away and I‚Äôm ready for my trip even if it‚Äôs at the last minute! Love the way they held promotions and keeping their visuals relational to their customers. In addition, claims process was effortless and prompt. Definitely will subscribe from NTUC income again in future. Introduced NTUC income to my family and colleagues, all of them felt the same. Definitely worth the money spent !"
4,"I strongly recommended NTUC Income travel insurance for its high efficiency rate. There was once i was on a holiday at Thailand with my family. I was hospitalised for food poisoning during my trip. Luckily, i was able to get a fully expense claim on this incident. It was a simple and fast process to get it done. The agent was friendly and even ensure i had get the full amount too. Therefore, i recommend NTUC Income travel insurance to all"
4,"I strongly recommended NTUC Income travel insurance because you can apply via online fast and secure. There's no complicated steps and if you have any doubts, their representative will answer it. Most importantly, their claim was fast. I remembered there was once, i fallen sick and i just need to take the receipt pic and submitted online. Within 3 days, it was approved."
4,"They have really comprehensive and cost-effective plans, especially for group / family travel. Whenever I travel with my family, one of my top considerations would definitely be NTUC income as they provide more flexibility when it comes to group sizes and can end up more cost-effective than other companies who only offer individual plans / group plans with strict restrictions."
3,"NTUC is my go-to travel insurance as the premiums are affordable and they have an app which is convenient for me to check on my policies. Of course, the downside is that their policies are more basic in nature."
5,"Bought this as a travel plan for my family. Its website is easy to navigate and can easily compare between all the plans. The plans are also very comprehensive. Its a brand that my parents trust too given that its quite well known in singapore. Thus, we believed that we should be able to get a claim or seek help whenever we require. "
5,Ntuc income has been one of my frequent used travel products. They offer rental car excess at its higher Tortola which many other Singapore travel insurers do not use.  One of the best travel insurance to use if you driving a rented car during your holidays.   Application for the insurance is straightforward  
5,My go-to option when it comes to purchasing travel insurance for my holiday! So far I haven't had any bad experiences with them and their customer service is super efficient. I love how affordable the insurance options are which is why I tend to reach out to them more often than the others. Thumbs up!
3,"Have not had to make a claim thus far but usually will purchase the PreX plan for my mom because there aren't very many options for people with pre-existing medical conditions to get covered! However, I always have trouble purchasing the NTUC Income insurance online - it is infuriating. The transaction can never go through and we end up having to purchase over the phone, which involves me giving out my credit card details to the operator, and I'm really not comfortable with that. I have tried reporting the problem I have with the online portal multiple times but no one can tell me what the issue is. I guess it might be time to consider MSIG instead. "
5,i have always preferred ntuc income travel insurance for its low premiums with basic protection for my family
4,"Bought this insurance for my Australia trip which required us to rent a rental car, and so far based on my research they seem to have one of the highest car hire excess amongst the other insurance but at a reasonable price point for its premium. But (fortunately) we did not manage to claim for anything, hence not entirely familiar with the claim process. "
5,"NTUC travel insurance was pretty easy to get. Application was straightforward, and there was a discount when I got it (yay!).  Coverage is pretty good; it covers the basics that travellers would typically need.   Have not made any claims yet, so nothing to comment regarding this. Will update if I ever make any claims (hopefully never)!"
1,"Thou it may be cheap.  However it was the slowest to process claim.  It took almost 10-12 weeks to process medical claims and lost of luggage for a family trip to Taiwan in 2015.  Need to made repeated calls to follow up.  Even if it is free,  I will not accept.   I am using other insurance companies now, can't comment on their service as there is no claim yet. "
4,Cheap and easy to apply for.  This is a basic travel insurance at best convenience.  Do consider if you are first time traveling out of country
5,"Protect against travel delays, trip modifications, lost belongings and medical expenses. Coverage for pre-existing medical conditions"
1,"Income Travel Insurance  does not honour claim for flight delay and cancellation.  Due to a flight cancellation on departure date and my trip was moved to leave one day earlier.  They did not honour this even though I had bought the insurance for my trip 6 months earlier.  Instead they made me pay extra one day of premium for my insurance to remain valid.  Then I had a 13hr flight delay and got to change to take another flight and ended connecting my next flight 6 hours later in another location and arriving my destination 6 hours later. They also rejected my claim saying my alternate flight flew off 2 hours later and the delay of 6 hours to reach my final destination was not accepted.  Income travel insurance seems useless for travel protection. Thus, I highly do not recommend Income Travel Policy and caution those to think twice before signing with Income."
5,Love the easy application which takes only a few minutes and price is much more cheaper compared to other insurance companies too! Coverage is comprehensive! 
5,Thank you for being there when i need you most during my travel! Makes my trip hassles free and smoother journey! 
5,Since we owned a car we had been buying from NTUC. It is fuss & free and also can earn link points for my  groceries shopping... 
5,The product features are comprehensive and premiums are competitive. Application process is straightforward and simple. Entire customer journey is pleasant! Great üëçüèª 
4,"no issue buying it online and easy to buy.  have not claim before and i hope i never need to claim, so far so good"
2,"I will buy travel insurance whenever I travel and may not be the same insurance company.  My choice would be based on the coverage, discounts offered and the reputation / reliability of the insurance company.  I don‚Äôt chose NTUC  travel insurance because they don‚Äôt offer very good discounts as compared to others for the same coverage.  Prices are not very competitive."

Having a pre-existing condition myself, I find it great that they also offer the Enhanced PreX Plans that put my worries at ease when I am overseas, so that I can engage in new experiences and do the things I really love. Their customer service consultants are also very friendly and knowledgeable to answer my queries and process any claims."
1,"I had my bag stolen. NTUC refuse to honor my claim because they said I was not looking at my bag when it was stolen, hence it was negligence on my part."
5,"During my recent trip, my parents and I encountered a delayed baggage situation where two of our three luggages were delayed. Since we took Jetstar where we had to purchase our own luggages, we bought a 2 x 20KG to be shared among the 3 of us (each of us had one luggage) and that means two of our luggages are registered under one name. Just so happened that both the delayed luggages were the ones under the same name. The first claim  was simple and straightforward, insurer and delayed baggage was the same person (me). However, the second luggage that was also under my name actually belongs to my dad. In situations like that, we are generally at the mercy of insurer whether they are willing to give the benefit of the doubt even though that is the fact. While it took a little longer, NTUC Income granted my second claim without any need for appeals, arguments or whatsoever. The overall claim experience was good and hence I highly recommend NTUC Income travel insurance."
4,"Easy to use and if you download the Orange Travel app, all the details are saved inside. The next time I choose to buy, it's so simple!"
5,"Purchased NTUC Income's travel insurance Deluxe plan for my trip to Thailand in May 2018. The purchasing process was simple and quick and I only had to pay a premium of $27.28 which is very affordable. Not sure about the claiming process as I didn't have to process any claims. Overall, I would consider purchasing travel insurance from NTUC Income again in the future as their premiums are priced competitively."
5,"NTUC is the travel insurance I'll buy when travelling overseas. It's reasonably affordable, and application process is a breeze. However, I never had to submit any claims yet, so can't comment on that portion."
1,"I bought a travel insurance previously from NTUC Income. When I submit my claim, they acknowledge that there is a strike in Paris but I did not stay there for more than 6 hours. I stayed for 3 hours and 45 minutes and took the 6pm train but still not entitled. Secondly, there is only business class available due to the strike but of course again, they acknowledge that there is a strike but under their terms and conditions, you cannot take an upgraded train even though there is no other train tickets left.   That said, buy at your own risk. You buy insurance to protect yourself but in the end, the insurance company is protecting themselves more than protecting you."
4,It‚Äôs pretty cheap and comprehensive for travel insurance. Can easily buy on their website before flying off. The claims for medical needs after returning from trips were also rather straight forward and processing time was acceptable. A rather value for money travel insurance. Look out for promotion periods during holiday peak times for extra discounts or gifts. 
5,Plus! members who apply via the Plus! website - https://plus.com.sg/apply/insurance/travel-insurance will receive 8 LinkPoints for every $1 premium spent!
5,I have been buying NTUC income travel insurance almost every year. Made claims so far and the process is a breeze as long as you provide all the documentation they need. Thumbs up.
5,NTUC income is my go-to travel insurance provider! I like that it is easy to understand the T&Cs and it comes at a reasonable pricing while offering decent premiums. The purchasing process is also straight-forward and fuss-free. Haven't had the need to claim anything but I believe that it will be hassle-free experience. :)
4,Quick and easy application process. Coverage is average but the explanations are detailed enough for me.
4,This is my go-to travel insurance provider. The purchasing process is straight-forward and user friendly and the premiums are reasonable. I managed to make some last-minute purchases through my mobile phone also so that's a plus.  Haven't had the need to claim anything though.
4,"Cheap and easily-purchased option (especially if buying insurance last minute). Clearly presents the choice of higher coverage if engaging in higher risk activities (e.g. SCUBA diving, horseback-riding).  No experience with claims."
5,"Thankfully my mother suggested NTUC income travel insurance when I went for my study trip overseas for 3 months. I compared NTUC income with various companies and the plan price and payout was most compatible for me. What I liked about it was its easy to comprehend terms and conditions, with less jargon.. basically it is made simple.  I came into a misshap in the UK, and was thankful for the relatively smooth service provided by NTUC Income at the time when I first contacted them as well as the follow thru with claims. A good experience with my purchase of travel insurance with them!"
3,"It's okay... I use Singtel Fibre Broadband at home and it's quite unreliable sometimes, poor connection too... I can't even use Whatsapp call at home?! But Singtel has some great deals like discounts at Mastercard Theatres! "
1,"Always throttling broadband speeds, causing inconsistent connection. Disappointed with the service and am currently a happy MyRepublic user. "
4,Singtel has been great for home. No issue whatsoever.   Only advice would be to check your bills to avoid charges for additional unknown services :) but easy to dispute otherwise. 
2,"Really poor connection for me. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because of my housing location (west, bukit panjang), but somehow the connection between walls is so poor. My modem is placed right outside my door. But once the door closes, it takes ages for me to load a page. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è "
2,"Connection is ok. But when I move into my room or go to the loo, I lose connection instantly. Generally, a pain to deal with.  "
2,Had a lot of internet connection issues back when I was using it 2 years ago. Cancelled and moved over to Starhub since.
4,"Decent personal experience with singtel, very occasional downtimes. Rather consistent Speed-wise as well"
4,"Have been using Singtel's broadband, mobile and TV bundle for quite a while now! My household is pretty satisfied with their services and customer service. Whenever we face WiFi connection difficulties, their customer service centre is reasonably efficient at providing us with some help. The best part is honestly the free Singtel WiFi hotspot around many locations in Singapore. There have been many moments when my monthly 4G usage is about to 'bao' and the free Singtel WiFi comes along handy."
5,Have been a long time subscriber with Singtel Broadband with my family! So far so good!  It would be interesting to see if there's disruption in the broadband space though! :)
5,"It is fast and the service  is good. The persk given by singtel is escellent. In terms of download speed , it is one of the best in Singapore."
5,"I have been a Singtel Broadband user for more than a decade. The internet speed is mostly stable and fast, allowing us users to enjoy streaming our videos and playing games with no worries of being interrupted.  Moreover, Singtel offers a bundle called Singtel Circle, whereby customers who also use Singtel's mobile, TV and home digital line services can get a huge discount off bills. Highly recommend!"
4,I switch to SingTel broadband from StarHub (was on StarHub broadband for 4 years). The sign up process was quite smooth but the activation process took few weeks to complete due to insufficient capacity on Netlink end (they give me cash rebate of $20 due to the delay).    The experience with SingTel broadband had being quite good for past 3 months. Nothing to complaint.   The only problem is their home internet filter some time block legitimate site which I'm not sure why. The home internet filter is free trial for 6 months which I will unsubscribe after the trial end.
3,Family has been long time subscriber of singtel. Poor connection and rather unfriendly service as well. Would not recommend for first timers. Not the singtel of the past anymore
4,"Singtel broadband has been one of the most reliable in terms of having the least disruption. However, the default router provided by Singtel does not provide wide coverage for WiFi connection, even for a 4-room HDB flat. The router does not have any antennas to help with increasing WiFi coverage. Walls and other electronic devices can cause the wifi signals from the router to be weaker, so you might want to get some WiFi mesh devices offered by Singtel together with your plan at a monthly top up price to increase WiFi connectivity. If you‚Äôre using LAN cable connection, it is quite reliable and I did not have any issues so far.  The Singtel online portal for the fibre broadband service is quite useful and intuitive too to help you manage your fibre broadband connection settings and monitor the devices using your network."
5,"I have been using Singtel broadband service since I moved into my new house about 1.5yrs ago, have not encounter any connectivity or speed issues. I test my internet speed quite frequently and it has stayed at high download/upload speed since day 1, so very well done Singtel!"
4,"I have been a Singtel user for close to a decade now, and to be honest, they have the best customer service, promotion, and improvements in connectivity. Many look for cheaper options with competing brands, but staying loyal has its benefits. I just upgraded to their 2GB Fibre Broadband using a Google Wifi. My entire house has strong connection, Singtel TV and concurrently streaming HD videos across multiple devices have no major issue. Once in awhile, I do experience some intermittent loss of connection, but I reset of my modem immediately solve the problem."
3,"The wifi is ok and mostly - a lot of devices at home at least can connect to it, but once in a while my phone will lose connection to the wifi, and I need to switch the wifi on and off on my phone. "
5,"I am with Singtel Internet since 56K plan era. Since then, I have since upgraded to ADSL 256k, ADSL 512K, ADSL 1M, ADSL 10M, then finally to Fibre Broadband 2 years ago.   Now I am using 500M fibre broadband plan after the free upgrade from 300M plan during the 24 months contract period, what a rewarding gesture for loyal Singtel subscriber. This plan also included free digital home line, free 1GB 3G mobile broadband sim card, free personal singnet email and free wireless router.  Fibre broadband connection wise, I never experience any slowdown, drop or cut in connection, as widely commented by others. Local or overseas websites load in an instant. So are playing RPG games on computer and watching Youtube/Netflix on SmartTV simultaneously, do not affect the connection quality.   The free digital home line came in handy for elderly to use at home or adhoc calls to banks where the waiting time to talk to a staff, are usually more than 5-10 minutes.   What I am quite puzzle was the free 1GB 3G mobile broadband sim card. Till now with 4G being a mainstream network, Singtel is still giving out 3G mobile broadband sim card? Nevertheless, I have used this 3G mobile broadband sim card in my tablet, good for some light usage of checking emails and social media websites while I am on the go.   Customer service through the hotline 1688 was quite prompt and friendly such as requesting to recontract the fibre broadband plan. Everything runs smoothly with Singtel since 56K plan era, I never got the chance to complain about the internet connection or bill problems yet.  Price wise, though their fibre broadband plans are not the cheapest, they are also not the most expensive ones. I am still paying $29.90/including GST monthly for 500M fibre broadband plan!"
5,Singtel speed is best amongst all broadband available in Singapore.The only problem is it has 2 years contract.
4,"Using Singtel Broadband 1GBPS for about 6 months @ $41.90. I missed the $39.90 deal. Stable connection so far, Reliability is my top priority. After research, decided on ST though it's value is slight high compared to SH at that point when i sign up.  "
5,"I've been a customer for over 2 years and have no complaints. The speed is fast and consistent, customer service has always been helpful and the setup process was quite easy. I called to setup the appointment and the engineer arrived at the allotted time and date and set everything up. While not the most cost competitive in the market, I give it points for reliability and recently renewed my contract with them"
5,"Had been using Singtel Broadband for many years since young. The connection is stable and good with minimal downtime, only once in awhile. Thus, overall  it is pretty reliable! Speed is decent too. However, sadly had to switch to Starhub broadband due to Starhub cable tv which will cease to exist. So Starhub's new fibre tv requires Starhub fibre broadband as well, hence had no choice but to switch. Would recommend Singtel! "
4,"TLDR: Buy at $39.90 only. Singtel customer service is reliable just be patient and put your phone on speaker mode while waiting to get through to customer service.  Used to do my research on 1GBPS Internet to get the best value for money. Realised the standard price to meet is $39.90 with standard router. There are occasional 29.90 from other provider but it's like rare Pokemon. So if you happen to see 39.90 for 1GBPS, you are pretty much safe.   Next, customer service. Many of my friends have switch to other service providers but experience slow or non existent customer support. I find singtel customer service professional and reliable. Had multiple major complains with them in the past 2 years, state your case clearly and be firm and reasonable and the demands can be met. They are after all a big company. Just be patient, on your HP speaker and wait to get thru to customer support.  Internet speed quality: All the same la.   Most of us would not even use up to 500GBPS. Many factors affect the speed, location and direction of modem, internet cable use (Cat 6E?), Router (AC?), Walls in between. Is there a need for Mesh in HDB, maybe not. Just use your old router and set up another point in the room. If you are creating a smart home, most devices in the market are so not smart that uses only 2.4G only. So speed wise does not matter.  If you are able to get Singtel at 39.90 or lesser with customer support. I don't see a reason why you want to risk other provider if customer support may be lacking. Even more so, if you bundle with your Power (Recommended), TV (Not recommended), HP (Recommended)."
4,"--------------------------------------------------- -300mbps fiber with free home digital line -free routers installation and routers (i think NetLink Trust Fibre Termination Point was already installed) -free 1gb mobile broadband sim ~$32 inclusive gst (was around $24 for adsl i think) Takes it because cheapest option ---------------------------------------------------  Was using Singtel ADSL broadband till letters informing of cessation of ADSL service and promo rate for 300Mbps fiber service around beginning of 2019. At that point, was comparing between 300Mbps fiber plans with other telcos, M1 and Starhub. Apparently, Singtel still turn out to be the slightly cheaper option due to Singtel waiver of registration fees for new customers(along with free installation of router and routers). I was quite surprised since waiver of registrations fees is the norm to entice new customers. Eventually signed up with the Singtel guy who just happened to go door to door to solicit.   --------------------------------------------------- Installation (tldr - took like 2 weeks to resolve digital line issue, with a few intermittent issues weeks after, needing to restart the optical router) --------------------------------------------------- After the on-site installation, faced issues with the Home digital line that comes with the fiber plan. Calls to home number met with terminated tones. Initially, spent 20 - 30mins total on my mobile line just to reach a singtel CSO - Yes, it is still as inefficient at the start of 2019. Was advised to wait a few days since it was a new line.   Meanwhile, open the router settings of the network optical router and discovered that there was another home number that was assigned in the VoIP Info. Finally decided to use the Singtel app to reach customer service. CSO described it as a ""shadow number"" that i dont need to worry about. Not sure if he was trying to smoke me lol.  --------------------------------------------------- Usage --------------------------------------------------- Speed is so much faster than 700Kbps adsl, duh :D Games downloads from Steam, Uplay etc, consistently fast. Point to note, it also really depends on the site you are connecting to. if the other end feeds data back slow, of course the page loading will be slow.   Sometime ago, Singtel upgrades it free to 500Mbps. Benefits of being on the lowest plan (:  seeing now that there is only 1Gbps onwards.  I refuse to pay more and more for the lowest plan available.  "
3,"I have been on Singtel for 30 years now and though been a loyal customer, the benefits are no longer there as its use to be. From a personal touch in the early 90's where CSO will call you or send to you vouchers for birthdays and mobile phone anniversary upgrades. Now, not a call nor any goodies for the loyal customers.  Even the coverage of their network, especially 4G, is getting from bad to worse.   I really hope that they really do something about their network performance and reliability."
4,"Using since the start and they have improved both speed and service Occasionally will have to restart the router,otherwise still good and reasonably priced "
4,"Despite all the flak on SingTel, you can most definitely rely on their service if a stable connection is what you are looking out for, "
4,I am using singtel now. The broadband is kind of slow at times. It requires me to reset my modem at least 4 months once.
5,"I have been SingTel broadband user for a long period. So far is stable, save the hassle of reinstallation and when recontact SingTel offered me good comparative rates. I always value for money"
4,"I‚Äôve been a 1GBPS Singtel broadband user for some years; I just renewed my contract as they dangled a discount. Generally for home use connectivity is reliable, but sometimes there are intermittent disconnections at night. "
4,Subscribed to the Wire Mesh plan under Singtel. Have been enjoying stable and fast connections of roughly 20-30MB/S with wireless. Very rarely are there any hiccups. Still my go-to for Broadband.
4,Been a  loyal Singtel broadband user for many years.For service wise and connectivity price is slightly on the higher end. But overall quite reliable for broadband.Only occasionally need to screw them for follow up service when problems arise.
3,"Had been a singtel broadband user for almost 10 years. Frankly speaking, its not the best cos i am only on 500mb fibre plan which is already obsolete. But it more than suffice for a single user like me who mostly watch youtube, netflix or stream videos. So i am pretty satisfied with the service singtel is providing "
5,Been a Singtel broadband user for many years now. Good service and connectivity. Price is slightly on the higher end. But overall no complains! 
5,"The most fast and reliable broadband connection for you to enjoy everything from HD video streaming to online gaming, in the comfort of home."
4,It‚Äôs good very fast speedy I like it  very very much but sometimes very slow sometimes fast especially when inside my room 
4,"Normally when thing comes to broadband provider, it won‚Äôt get wrong if choose the local brand with government background, however Singtel got some issue with connection breakdown in the pass few year. "
3,"I‚Äôm on family plan on singtel and that‚Äôs not so fast. My mobile phone is on CIS discount, but there‚Äôs no discount for broadband."
1,"Slow , expensive and bad connectivity , wifi needs mesh to haven better signal, and overall the speed is really slow for the price you pay for"
1,You wont get internet at night. Snobby customer service. The internet will keep disconnecting. I havent tried any other provider (been here only recently). Seems i am stick real bad with singtel. Any nee users - refrain!
1,Nothing great and fantastic as usual. Just typical day in the park for Singtel. Time for a revolution.
2,"Singtel markets itself as a ""premium brand"" in the internet space --- touting better coverage and charging higher premiums --- but it's products and services fall way short.  I subscribed to a two year 1 Gbps home broadband package and kept getting problems with SLOW internet and frequent connection issues. I consistently measured download speeds of only 80Mbps on my iPhone which is way below their quoted ""typical"" speeds.   I abandoned Singtel after my contract expired last month in favor of MyRepublic - now I pay $20 less every month, with absolutely no difference in internet speeds plus no connection issues. I really don't understand the value of choosing Singtel over their competitors, unless you're going with the home cable TV bundle.   Personally, I won't ever go back to them again. "
4,"Currently using this for my home broadband! connection is usually pretty decent, but occasionally when it's down we have to trouble shoot it.   What I like is the customer service where they will send someone over to help repair the place when we need help with the broadband configuration. And within 1 day!"
1,"Hi friends,  if you are a foreigner I suggest not to take this connection under 12 months or 24 months contract.  I lost my job in SG due to some company issues within 6 months and singtel is worse and don't want to waive off even a small amount on penalty.   The penalty is same as what you have to pay for remaining months. Also you may not able to transfer this line you need a friend whose contract is really ending up.   I am very unhappy to pay full amount even without using the service,  which is very worse part with singtel service."
4,I have been on Singtel Fibre 1Gbps internet for many years. The speed has always been good and stable. Perhaps because I have been using my own ASUS router. I never use the router provided by Singtel in all my years of subscription.
5,"Smooth application process, customer support was fantastic. Network is stable and mobile plan is competitive."
5,"Hello! I'm using the Uno 18 plan with no contract. 1GB data is good enough as I mainly use home, office and public Wi-Fi. In terms of speed and connection, both are reasonably good. There's free Caller ID, incoming calls and SMS.   Best of all, there's boundless data so I can still use the internet (albeit at a slower speed) if I exceed my data limit, no worries about paying extra. I also don't have to pay extra if I decide to change plan. The CSOs are efficient and helpful as well.   Highly recommended!"
5,"I am not writing just for the sake of a review or to praise. Honestly I am using this one for the last 3 years and the speed and service is awesome.Did not get a single issue till now. Only once my router got spoiled and when I take to ASUS service center, they replaced 1-2-1 with a brand new. I do not want to mention the previous 2 vendors I used, but when compared, there is a 200% difference. I will 1000 times recommend this."
5,"Good value sign up online for more than one year, free delivery. Uno plan only $8 monthly No contract, 1000 minutes talktime, boundless data. Last month, I experienced, No in & outgoing calls, no sms both ways. Myrepublic was very kind & efficent, troubleshoot my issues, replaced SIM card for free. Telco subscribers, will only know what is their Telco level & standard of service quality when a problem arises ? "
5,"Have been using the $8 uno plan since May 2018, at first the network was not been consistent for me (eg drop calls, no data) , thanks to their friendly customer service, they replaced a new sim card and now is it wonderful! 1000mins outgoing call + 1000 sms +1gb data (throttled speed after that) at only $8 a month is a steal. Although the promotion is now $18 a month instead of $8, I might consider signing up for my mum next month! Thanks MR!! "
5,"I have be using myrepublic for almost 2 year , all is smooth great recommandation to all. Internet is great and hardly had any downtime"
5,"I signed up the plan during the initial launch.   Registeration was smooth and easy as i ported my number over. Delivery was on time on target.   Really a good deal as the plan is valued for money, with 1000mins of talk time, which is essential for my Business..   Thanks! "
5,Application process was smooth and easy. There is always network everywhere i go.my kids and me total 3 lines with myRepublic.customer service is good enough for me.
5,Everything is really smooth and their customer service help alot if we need more info in services.... thumb up for them..... üëç
4,"As I am a heavy consumer of data of approximately 30 to 40gb per month, I chose the ultimate 80 plan which provides 80gb of data for $80 per month.  The network is quite steady most of the times. The data roaming add ons are really convenient when you are travelling. "
3,Subscribed two mobile lines for my parents truly value for money. Wish there will be more benefits added in the $8 per month plan for old folks. 
5,Excellent customer service. The officers are quick to help solve problems and are always courteous. Internet connection for mobile is great. Broadband at home is OK. Sometimes signalling goes on and off in the morning between 10am - 1pm. 
4,I'm taking the most basic plan of 35 dollars.. It serve me well with all the data I need.. Very recommended for those who need more data like me and always love to call and text.. Is a wonderful plan tht suit me and my parents. 
5,"Honestly, for a first timer of using a line & first time using "" MyRepublic "", I shall say I really love it! Their customer service is good. I've asked a question regarding this line & they replied to me within an hour which is quite good. The signal is fast & smooth even for a wifi too. Price is fixed & it is boundless data, who wouldnt love it?!??! "
5,"So far I think MyRepublic is the best telco that I ever have after tried many telcos. The plan price is very reasonable, The MyRepublic Talk app can allow you to make roaming calls at local rates & the customer service response is fast & good."
5,I've been using MyRepublic Mobile  Service for a Year without any problems. So far so good üëå keep it up MyRepublic. 
5,"Very affordable monthly subscription with the flexibility to change plan, great customer service. Glad I sign up as a myrepublic user. Love you 3000 myrepublic! "
3,I applied MyRepublic as a spare data for my son who has been exceeding his own data plan.... he has complain that once 1 GB is used data will be very slow but is good to have an unlimited data on hand. Thank you
4,"Used myrepublic for a year already. Plan is very good and doesn't charge for exceeded usage of data. Most services is fine as they are on starhub network.  What can be improved is probably data roaming. In their app, they listed China as one of the destination. Obviously not working because I can't even get a signal in parts of China, so all my otps didn't work, let alone surfing the internet.   Another possible issues is that when data roaming is used up, you cannot surf internet at all. Imagine that you have to access the app to purchase one time booster, but you don't have internet at all while outside. So, I think the data roaming should be allowed to surf just myrepublic portal page only to allow purchase of add-on after the data is used up.  I have also encountered a case where I didn't received any call a whole day but signals is all up and running. In the end, I received a chunk of sms showing all the call that I have missed. Is a one time occurrence so not exactly a big deal here.  Otherwise, I love MR for giving the telcos a run for their $$!  Anyway, competition for M1 is catching up, their sim only plan is very competitive at 28sgd and has 15gb!"
4,"Signed up for their UNO plan about a year ago, definitely worth the value. I like how they don't charge you for over using your data bundle but instead simply slow down the speed unlike some other telcos. They also don't charge you for caller ID. However, I've had issues receiving OTPs occasionally especially when I try to pay with my card online which requires OTP, there have been multiple times when I couldn't receive it and couldn't go on with my purchases. Have read online that it is a common problem which I hope will be solved soon. Definitely will stay on as my plan is really worth it but the other plans available right now seem worth the value too. "
5,My republic Mobile is a recommended telco with its fast data. The phone contract is recommended to get installment plans with debit. I can get new phones with sim card send to my address without hesitate to go or queing up to the shop like other telco's to sign a new contract. Will recommend to my friends and family to sign up for My Republic Mobile Plans. Thank You My Republic.
5,"APPLICATION and/or ADDITIONAL SIM?  Application process via online is relatively easy and will not take more than 10minutes.   CONNECTION STRENGTH? Undoubtedly, this telco connection impressed me. Whilst travelling regardless of in tunnel or at camp sites, there isn‚Äôt a significant drop in the connection signal as compared to my previous telco (not pointing fingers). Playing Mobile legends definitely require good connection signal. Broadband also provides very STABLE connection for first-person shooting (FPS) games.   PRICE? Other than the above mentioned. For $35/month without contract, 15GB total data for Broadband Customers and with the benefit of boundless data there‚Äôs nothing to worry about exceeding the data plan. Moreover, free incoming calls, SMS and caller ID. In general sense, this is EXTREMELY worth it.  "
5,"I have a GAMER plan and 2 Mobile plans under me. Though the customer service may be slow and bad at times, but they are willing to rectify ASAP every time i have issues on the connection or billing.   I have been their customer since 2015.  "
5,"Probably the best phone plan to suit my need. My grandma needed a phone line, and I figured that she doesn't need data, just calls only. Myrepublic is the only telco with a plan that cost a single digit and I even forgot which account it deducts from every month. That is how insignificant it costs."
4,"Have been using their mobile line for more than a year. They do not have the best coverage but it‚Äôs worth the price. Even after excess your monthly data quota, the buffered speed is still good enough for normal website surfing and Facebook scrolling. Will have issue streaming YouTube video though. Their customer service is one of the best I encountered. "
3,"Mobile plan is value for money. However, the delivery was messed up. The delivery guy did not check the delivery information and wasted my time to make a trip for collection. Online Customer service and support is bad. Will recommend others to head down to the shops rather than doing online registration and delivery. "
4,Application process was smooth and easy. There is always network everywhere i go.my kids and me total 3 lines with myRepublic.customer service is good enough for me.
5,"I have been MyRepublic for more than a year. Very satisfied with their service so far. There was once MyRepublic charged me overseas call for joining a group (based in England) in Telegram. Personally, I felt that it is just like any whatsapp call and hence wrote in via email to enquire about matters. After MyRepublic had conducted a thorough investigation, they were willing to waive off the charges. Thank you MyRepublic for your excellent service provided. "
5,I'm using broadband myrepublic ..the service is good even b it online or at the shop it's easy to communicate n apply...they hav been a good service since day 1 I've applied...I've also applied mobile plan with them too....recommend to my sis n friend with my referral n they have benefits....thank u for being our 4th telco...plss do hav more great values to come in future ..üòä
5,Faster and better should recommend to my friends.working friends  And also friends friend friends friend  
5,"User for both broadband n telco. Only encounter 1 problem after changing to Deco sets,after that all wents well.Broadband users for 3 years.As for telco,i chose the most cheapest plan as i am a full time housewife and dont want to burden my hubby with an expensive plan.If my data use up for the particular month,i can easily purchase it thru the apps.Will recommend others to use MyRepublic. "
1,"Your customer service nowadays is almost impossible to reach. Luckily, I kept the last corresponding emails with your CS that I am able to write in.  Not sure why I get charged for Incoming calls I did not answer while overseas."
4,Great service... Very fast response by the customer service if we were to enquire all about their service eg:roaming to oversea. CSA very efficient and helpful during assist on the phone... Good Job My Republic
1,"The mobile plan is really suck.. I only use the line for 14 day i they cut the line off due to not paying the line on time..  U image only just 14 day use not even 1 month they alrdy cut ur line n ask u to make pay... highly not recommended.. N if u dont pay on the same month they will cut off ur line, they will not allow u to bring forward to next month bill.. "
5,The phone line is really cheap got it for myself and my son and the internet plan also good.quite cheap and affordable.thank republic for the plans.more years to come
4,Everythings great but sometime connection is bad bad bad.... Anyway greatjob MyRepublic you are MyNumberOne!!!!
5,Best plans with great network connection. Easy to sign up for either SIM only plans or even plans with mobile phones. Delivered to your doorstep at your own convenience.
2,"Tried myrepublic mobile service for around 1.5mths. Signal reception really not as good as M1 which I had been using for more than 15yrs.  I still keep another line with m1 though.  When catching Pok√©mon, I can still catch Pok√©mon in shopping mall, e.g. Bukit timah plaza, when enter underground mrt, but with my republic line, totally can‚Äôt catch. I have to step out of the building  to catch it.    When making phone call, it takes longer to receive a connection to another party under normal outdoor environment like orchard road, novena, (not tuas area).   Reason why I am still keeping the line becos the roaming charge is reasonable -  $6 per month from date of activation to Malaysia, which I go around 2-3times a month. Calling to SG only $0.05/min, but again sometimes have signal issues "
5,"When MyRepublic came out with their Uno plan(1GB of high speed data, 1000 min outgoing call, 1000 sms), I immediately applied for my elderly relatives as they do not consume a lot of data and prefer calling. The ""boundless"" data feature is useful as it would ensure that they do not get a bill shock. The only thing is that their throttled data after 1GB is used up is significantly slower than that of Zero1."
3,Reasonable rates but customer service not too good. Not many plans to choose from. Slow internet speed.
5,Customer service via phone takes a long time but expected. Best way to contact them is via messenger.  Mobile broadband is generally quite fast and stable. Using it for gaming is generally stable as well. Telco service is good and convenient since you can buy roaming data via the app. Coverage is not fantastic but decent enough.   They have great online services like app and messenger but via telephone takes a long time. I don't mind actually as I feel messenger is more convenient.
5,Applied for my mother in law house. Respond was good and good receiver. So far no problems. Will try to get it for my house after contract end. 
5,Was introduced to MyRepublic from a relative and i definitely made the right choice of providers. So far have not faced any server issues with MyRepublic. Will definitely recommend to my other relatives and friends as well.
3,"I had switch from singtel to MR. for almost a month, data usage is acceptable. even data roaming in japan was good, 4/5.  the only setback is the local voice call. horrible!!!!!! 2/5 I will be switching telco again before the 1 month period . so decide for yourself. good luck."
1,Bad customer service assistance...poor network be it day or night...keeps on distrupting connection. Bad service providers.
1,The data receipt is horrible! Do not use their mobile plans although it is cheap. Waste of time and money.
1,"I just ported my number from singtel and all was good while i was at hoe with wifi. The moment i was out ,I soon realised that the data was working intermittently.  Really tried reset and called myrepublic but clearly they have an issue. I now wish to disconnect but they do have prorated charges. So i pay full month. I am very very very disappointed. Bad Data . "
1,They initially offered to apply a plan .. without any contract and pay only to Sim  so I go on with the application. But after 2 days they call me to inform me that I need to have a $200 security deposit for a new line.  I am not getting any unit in the plan. But only SIM application that's why i cancel my application instead. Not worth it compare to Circle.life offer totally no contract and no security deposit just pure and clear as what you apply for.
1,"DO NOT GET THIS. The wifi speed is super poor and on many nights, there isn't wifi connection at all. It is super frustrating. Get this at your own risk."
3,"local service is average, hard to get cs sometimes overseas data boost is really bad, msia is ok, i cant get any in vn or japan, theres signal and no data"
5,"$8 promotion plan is a great value. U get to add -on by using MyRepublic app.  1GB for $5,  3GB for $12.  1000 sms and 1000 call-out is the norm.  for me i auto add $12 for 3 more gb of data making it $20 a month , Still the cheapest plan  in singapore.   I hope MyRepublic will come up one more time the $8 promtion plan , because there are many people do not know about it and many more whose contract not ended yet didnt has chance to join MyRepublic.   Let US choose how many GB to add on , that is TRUE freedom !  I support MyRepublic !  "
5,"There are 2 plans available under MyRepublic mobile. However it's by invitation only. The public needs to wait a bit.  - Uno $8/month: 1000 SMS, 1000 minutes talk, free caller ID, 1 GB data - Ultimate $80/month: 1000 SMS, 1000 minutes talk, free caller ID, 80 GB data  Add on: - 1 GB: $5 - 3 GB: $12 - 8 GB: $30  It's a virtual telco using Starhub's infrastructure, so network speed/coverage should be the same as Starhub.  TIPS: ------  Do you know that you can rent a motorcycle in Singapore with Aloride.com? If you just want to try out a delivery job or try out a bike (e.g. 1 month), rent with us. Save the CoE & bike shop & insurance cost :-)  https://aloride.com https://fb.com/aloride  "
4,"I have their term life insurance. Sign up during promo period for 15% perpetual discount.  Good they have a steps tracking activity. If you clock enough steps, you get a 5% discount on the month's premium. Another 5% if you share the posting on facebook.   Very easy online sign up process."
4,Fuss-free and very easy to purchase.  They do send promotions occassionally for 50% off the purchase plan value. I think that would be the best time to buy annual travel insurance :)
5,"Bought AXA SmartTraveller insurance for my trip to Phuket through its online form and the policy document was sent promptly into my email. When I was back from my trip, I experienced coughing hence went to see a doctor. I made a medical claim against the insurance through its online claim form. The process of filling up the form was relatively quick and easy, and supporting documents were required to be attached with the form to validate your claim. The claim went through in around 1 week plus without any issues. All in all, the application and claiming process could be done quickly and easily. Quite a pleasant experience.  "
5,"Provides up to S$600,000 for medical and dental treatment. Covers loss of money and personal belongings. Protects your home contents and valuables against fire whilst you're travelling. Covers you for travel misconnection, travel diversion or trip curtailment."
5,"I bought AXA single trip package for my 15-day europe trip. The policy coverage is quite transparent. The price is not cheap, however, you should be well covered. "
4,"Bought this plan for a 5 months overseas travel and managed to claim for 2 incidents - the first time I tried to claim, they were super efficient and my claim came in pretty quickly. Second time I tried to claim though, it took several weeks despite me replying their email, and I had to continually pester them with at least 2-3 emails before I got my claim back. I guess it just depends on who's handling it, but still got all my claims back so would recommend. "
4,Quite pricey in terms coverage per dollar. Need to use promo code to save. Highest lost belongings claim. 
5,I bought this for my grandparents when they were travelling. Fuss free process to purchase and their promos are quite attractive. Didn't make claims but this is my go-to for travel insurance (:
5,Pretty hassle-free to claim insurance after my trip after I had to be hospitalised. Customer service was helpful and efficient.
5,Previously bought this travel insurance for Bangkok family trip. Easy to claim insurance process for my Mum who had to cancel her trip due to personal reasons.
5,"Have claimed before. It was easy to claim, and i got the money within a few weeks!  The claim was for a delayed luggage. "
5,"I always bought AXA SmartTraveller when it's on promotion because it can be quite expensive for 2 adults and 2 children. I like it because I have claimed for medical expenses after a trip and I usually received the claimed amount within 2 weeks. That's the fastest and no questions asked policy I have ever experienced. However,  the only shortfall is the overseas medical expenses limit which is cap at $1m whereas others are unlimited. That's why I bought this only for short trips. "
5,"I bought AXA SmartTraveller Essential single trip insurance for a trip to Phuket last year - $52 total for 2 pax for a 5 day trip. Was about 30% off! Just bought online the day before leaving and the process was pretty fast and easy, got confirmation over email within a day. Didn't make any claims in the end though."
4,Cheap travel insurance and the time when I bought is having promotion that giving me 50% discount. Very convenient that able to buy online 
5,"TravelSmart Premier provides the best level of coverage for your trip. The wide-ranging protection includes home content coverage, and etc"
5,"They offer the top coverage compare to other company plan, it normally comes with higher price, but it make worth to insure with them cause they often offer high discount. "
5,Easy to apply as it can be applied through OCBC ibanking and offer great promos time and time again. So keep a look out for the promos if you want some affordable travel insurance for reasonable coverage 
5,Great Eastern is the only provider I will get my Travel Insurance from as it‚Äôs the most comprehensive and convenient among all providers. 
5,Coverage is ok. Bought during promo. Did not need to claim and hence unable to feedback on reimbursement claim process 
5,"Appreciated that it was a fast application process online! No requirements for claim in the end, which is always a good thing ;) "
5,"Bought a travel insurance on discount last November. Unfortunately, my baggage was damaged. Fuss free and not much to submit, most importantly, I got my claim very fast! "
4,Fast to apply. Quick to complete. Every thing to proceed online. Claims is quick when all needed documents are submitted. 
5,"I bought a single trip Explorer insurance for a trip to Indonesia - $80 total for 4 pax for a 4 day trip. Got it at 50% off as there was an OCBC tie-up that's still ongoing (https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/insurance/explorer.html). Just bought online the day before leaving and the process was pretty fast and easy, got confirmation over email within a day. Didn't make any claims in the end though. Following this, I purchased this for a couple other trips including one to Japan (10 days, $45.60 after discount) and purchase process was smooth too. Didn't have to make any claims after similarly."
3,"Pros: -Live charts to the minute by chartnexus which I think is the best charting software among all the other brokerages. -App is very user friendly -Gives you points which can be exchanged for cash rebates or trading tools whenever you made a transaction  Cons: -Extremely little or no information on companies fundamentals and financials -Comes with limited types of advance orders like GTC and GTM, there is no SL or OCO orderss on the website platform. But you can put a stop loss via the app.  "
5,"has 1 of the best charting tool i've seen and used. Intuitive web GUI for buy/sell related. However, commission is pretty standard among the brokerage. "
5,"Apart from cash rebates and the referral, there's a sign-up promotion that gives $100/$150 vouchers and 1000limtan/5000linkpoints upon completing 3 online trades within a month of account opening. App's fuss free to use, idiot-proof. Broker shared that commission is lower buying via app than through him, and they will earn the (smaller) commission still,"
5,"Limtan currently has a sign up promotion where if you do three trades in 3 months, you get $50 of rebates.   In terms of commissions, the company is rather decent. It offers a 5% rebate in loyalty points to Limtan customers which I find quite good.  The only downside is that its branch is only at Raffles place and to sign up for an account one has to print out the application form to sign up.  For those interested to sign up, Limtan has a refer a friend promotion where both the referred and referral will get a $50 NTUC voucher each if 3 trades are made within 3 months.  In my view, quite decent commission rebate and definitely one of the best sign up promotion ( provided you know what stocks you have in mind to purchase)."
5,"reliable, easy to use! have been using Lim & Tan for over 10 years now, no regrets at all! Except for overseas trading, but that said, it's the same problem for all local brokerages, comms are too high."
2,"I went for VIC course about a year ago. Very disappointed mainly with the character of the management. A lot of underhanded tactics used to scam people of their money. They advertise a free preview worth hundreds of dollars but when you go to the preview, its just selling their main course and they refuse to answer any of your questions but just ask you to go to the course to learn. At the end of the preview, they try and pressure you to buy the course by saying that there are limited discounts for first certain number of people who sign up but actually in the end the discount is given to everyone. It is designed to make you fear losing out and sign up quickly without giving you a chance to think about the investment properly. As someone with previous financial background, I did not learn much new things in the actual course. To be fair, I can see how a novice would benefit from the course but the course is advertised as the only thing you need to attend to learn how to make money in the market when in fact the course covers so little concrete content. Most of it is playing games and spending excessive amounts of time doing nothing of value. I was further disheartened with the management when they tried to upsell their 'inner circle' on the last day of the course and they refuse to tell you the cost of it until you go for a interview. This interview is just another opportunity they use to try and psychologically coerce you into signing up as you have not much time to think about the financial cost beforehand. Thankfully I did not waste further money on it and learnt much more from reading online instead. Overall, I would not recommend this mainly because of the underhanded tactics of management. The bootcamp itself has some content but to price it at more than $4000 is insane."
5,I am really appreciate the opportunity to get to know about Value Investing Bootcamp! This brings me a lot of a valuable information to know how to pick potential stocks and manage the portfolio.   This is really awesome and I will recommend everyone to attend ! 
5,"The course not only teaches how to invest and how to keep fundamentals in mind, it infuses life fundamentals as well that one has to keep in mind when they invest their money. "
1,"Earlier this year, I signed up for a course organised by Value Investing College, with 8I Holdings being the parent company.  I later decided to withdraw the program as I had other priorities, and wanted to focus on other areas instead of attending the program and requested for a refund.  (I had confirmed with the owner - that I would be able to get a refund if I ever changed my mind about attending the course before making the decision)  However, the company has not kept to it‚Äôs end of the bargain and has kept coming up with excuses time after time and I have yet to receive contact from any one.  I initially emailed the staff-in-charge in Australia and I had gotten no response. So I sent a follow-up email while I copied the main VIC page.  Still no response, so I called them up and a girl said she would get back to me.(which she didnt)  Called again a couple days later - a person by the name of Andrew picked up and asked me to email him (to which I later found out was the email address I had copied in)  His response was that he thought the person in Australia would manage it for me - which Andrew mentioned the person in Australia (John) was away, so he would get Angie to handle my case within 3 business days.  Waited for 3 business days and no one contacted me - emailed again and I was told by Andrew (again...) that Angie was away on leave and ‚ÄúYen‚Äù would handle it instead.  Still, nobody followed-up with me.  I am not sure if this is how business is being conducted these days - or how service recovery should be made.   Please be careful if you are planning to attend ANY of their programs because if they cannot handle a simple operational matter - I doubt their ability to handle the seminars that they conduct. "
4,"A well conducted workshop taught by trainers who are not only knowledgeable but passionate, as well as attended by participants who were not only eager to learn but also to share.  "
5,"Good program that teaches the step-by-step way to value investing . Knowing the Fundamentals , when to buy and when to sell. Give me the confidence i need to invest in stock market again üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
5,"Great course great team, great logistic!!! For beginner and investors to learn more and exchange with professionals, and even start making money on the same days!!!"
5,"VIB is a wonderful and informative 3-day course. Many thanks to Pauline, Alex, German, Ken for your sharing :)"
4,Enjoyed the VIC Bootcamp. Learnt a great deal. Made lots of friends. Trainers and supporting staff were good in delivering the course. 
5,i just finished the value investing bootcamp. Increased my knowledge so much on investing before i get my fingers burnt. Learned a systematic method to go about choosing the stocks.
5,The program enhances my knowledge and able to give me the platform to learn more on investment and have the expert around to ask questions give me further confidence in my future exploring on investment!! Tk u VIC and Team!! 
5,"Glad I came for the course, the trainers are competent and shares openly. Thanks Pauline, Alex, Jeremy and Ken "
5,"Came in with no investing knowledge and after 3 days, understood that it is important to have knowledge and a system to evaluate which companies to invest in. Value investing bootcamp gave clarity, confidence and provide an excellent network community that students can belong in.   Thank you Pauline, Alex, Jeremy & the silent unsung team of helpers that ensured the bootcamp ran smoothly!"
5,A comprehensive course for somebody who knew nothing about investing. Am now empowered with the knowledge on value investing.
5,"I attended the VIC course , from a ""know nuts"" about investing, im empowered with the knowledge to do investing! "
5,Comprehensive knowledge and simple to understand. Definitely help me to roadmap my financial freedom
4,"I wanted to understanding value investing, and learnt of this program. The most important takeaway was knowing how to analyze a company, which financial ratios and valuation methods to use. There were fun elements as participants learnt through some games to uncover our emotions and mindset that we may have when investing. I believe it will be suitable for people without finance background too as it covers the financial statements at length. "
4,"I was an attendee of the Value Investing Bootcamp programme, as someone who has spent over 30K on various courses and seminars, I would say that this is one of the better ones I've attended as the trainers are sincere on imparting knowledge and helpful (I've gone for courses that were a complete waste of money)  As someone who has been investing for close to 7-8 years, I felt that it was a wonderful tie in for approach to investing for someone who has been basing my buys mostly on analyst recommendations. My group members had a varied mix, one lady was completely new so she felt overwhelmed by the content. 2 felt it was evenly paced and great value. Myself, I wanted more time on the options portion as I felt I was weaker there. Games were great fun and were good for imparting psychology for investing. Most of my group mates were happy with the programme, although I felt it could be improved.  I did feedback to the trainer to put more emphasis on certain modules, however the explanation i got was that there would be more coverage during the post programme tutorials.   Post programme support is genuinely good because they start to dive deep into the numbers and annual reports.   What I didn't like was the selling that was done during some gatherings. Personally I didn't sign up for any of their upsells so far, however, some of my friends who did (out of 4) all gave good feedback for the programmes and saw genuine results, so I hold my judgement on that.   I noticed VIC is part of a publicly traded company, so I suppose they have some earnings to hit?  Overall still very positive and I recommend 2 of my friends to join."
5,"Prior to the course, I randomly buy stock based on my gut feel. Am glad to have learnt a systematic method to calculate and identify good business model and under value stock. Hope to apply n gain more experience after the course."
4,Fundamentals! Fundamentals! You need it and they have it! Comprehensive training giving you a systematics way to identify the potential shares to imvest.
5,"Really explain value investment in details and emphasize on risk! Great trainer, comprehensive teaching materials, and well structured course! Great network, free VIC connect, and VIOS strategy! "
5,"The course will help a lot of peoples not get burn in the stocks markets (apply in worldwide stock exchange). They change my mindset stock market is from trading to value investing..  If want understand more on value investing course, please consult them. üòä "
5,Learn useful knowledge about value investing. They will help clear your doubts and teach you how to obtain passive income and grow your capital.
1,"Everytime I see many 5* reviews, my inner mind will ring an alarm. Maybe I was right. Many of those who gave 5* reviews are those in their own inner group. a director, franchisee, trainer, own people. I dun believe they had given an unbias view of the course.   Found out that VIC was acquired by 8I.  I attended the 8I course preview a while back. The speaker Ken seems like a nice guy until some of us declined to sign up for the actual course. Then he started to be sacarstic. Another speaker Pauline was better and friendlier, gave some insights of unit trusts and why we should avoid them.  Over the last few years as I attended more public seminars and investment fairs, I spoke to other people who had attended the 8I course. Most of them claimed to have lost money after investing in 8I private unit trusts. Hey, wait a minute. Didnt Pauline said unit trusts should be avoided? and yet 8I issued own trust funds? Something is not right.  Some of those I met also told me that they never got 100% of what was promised during the preview. Access to listed company tours, talk to listed company management, talk to Mary Buffett, get insights from 8I CIO...., all never materialised. These are only available if they sign up for advanced courses.  Personal view: Just attend the preview to learn how Pauline present and speak in public. I don't know if she still does previews since it is now VIC, not 8I. But also must have a strong mind to walk out after the preview.   No, I have not attended the actual course, but I think I would rather believe a few strangers who did not try to sell me anything, to a group of their own people who gave 5* reviews. "
1,"This is my opinion:  I would give VIC a miss. Yes, the people inside are very passionate and so forth, but ultimately the spirit of value investing gets lost after a while. Participants are encouraged to come back to attend exclusive insights into a stock, kept on reminding us that if we dont attend we will miss out on this ""LIFE"" time opportunity, then pressure participants to sign up for more related courses, books and programs so you see where am going with this..they encourage herd behavior then in the same breath tell us that herd behavior is wrong? Huh? and want us to spend more and more of our money into their products, that is why they/us remain poor and the founders are super rich   Word Synonymous related to VIC: Cult, MLM, half truths, pressure selling.  Anyway something positive about VIC is that the content provided is suitable for beginners, games are entertaining and will show you your flaws as an investor. Their networking session is also valuable provided you know how to network with the right persons and not another insurance/property agent wanting to upsell their products.    "
5,"I attended VIC free seminar via https://valueinvestingsingapore.sg years ago. The most important things that I took away from the course is to get rid of my previous bad habits of anyhow investing in stocks. Emotion part would screw things up. But now, it is a systematic approach to laser target when to buy a stock or exit selling a stock. Every stage is justified. It was really a fun experience to learn value investing. Aim not to be the 95% of the investors who failed in stock investing."
2,"As much as this course is hyped up and has many passionate people inside it, the true winners of this program are its owners. The repetitive advertisements to come to their free masterclass to learn about value investing is just a opportunity they use to pressure you to sign up for their course which is very expensive for what you actually learn. What you will learn is enough for a beginner but can be learnt for much cheaper elsewhere. Furthermore, when you come back for more lessons, they will try to pressure you to sign up for more courses to become a better investor and these are very costly as well and I feel they should be included in the original course. Would recommend you spend your money elsewhere. Most of the good reviews are probably from people who are higher up in the corporate structure or who have made money via investing not because of the course but because of the bull market itself the last 10 years."
5,"Love the post programme support which helps me to continue learning even after the course. The trainers are very experienced and are eager to share their experience. Apart from growing my own wealth, I'm also currently helping my mom manage her fund and hey, I'm only 21. Thank you VIC!"

The only thing that I think can improve is sometimes I find that the class can slow down a bit or do maybe some dry run before the actual execution for students who knows nothing about investment cuz i'm not familiar with the interface and all especially on the trading game.

Very suitable especially for beginners and also in the post support program we learn how to analyse companies on hand, and we learn about our own flaws as well and how to fine tune our investment process accordingly. Love the community <3"
5,"Have attended VIB in June 2018. The course has simply overthrown the concept of investing. Maintain a state of mind and not have a herd mentality, going through the simple steps of valuating a Business than a stock and going for value instead of price as value is what you get and price is what you pay keep you really far from losing. Investing is boring if you seek excitement go to USS."

5,"Attended VIC back in 2017, this is has opened my mind towards investing and as a person without any financial background, I could understand the terms & methods taught easily!

4,"Interests are based on min amount ($60,000), good choice if your salary is >6,000 due to salary credit (1.6% for SALA >6,000 via Giro). And you are eligible when meet 1 of 3 criteria. But bill payment must be >$35 per bill for getting the 0.8% interest and card spending 1,500 per month. BOC extended the # of ATMs and share ATMs with Maybank when you see the logo ""ATM 5"", you can find 3 nearby ATMs if stay in Serangoon and AMK due to new branch in AMK HUB L3 and 2 ATMs in NEX shopping mall.  "
4,"switched over for a few months between the transition between 360 and Multiplier account.  when it first came out, this was so much better than the 360 in terms of the interest rates. However, when the deal is too good, likely it's not sustainable and they revised shortly afterwards.  As for the reason why i switched over to Multiplier, now i don't strive for a minimum spending monthly. "
4,Switched over from ocbc360 and no regrets. just park extra cash here and pay 3 bills and earn more interest than ocbc. cap at 100k and more int beyond 60k.  cons is their PRC based call centre and online banking interface. it's are not tech savvy and so don't expect much. hard to find atm but it's good cos it means u can't withdraw. 
4,"An ""upgraded version"" of OCBC's 360 account. Harder to hit, lower cap at $60k. But its credit cards offerings are much more dynamic:  BOC Family: same as OCBC 365, but 1-2% higher rebate. Some cards offering dual currency (SGD/RMB or SGD/USD). Some cards with no foreign transaction fee."
4,"Bought a couple of times, the online application is such a breeze! Pricing is affordable and pretty competitive.  I am most impressed when my automated flight delay claim was approved without even me submitting any document!!! I got an sms within 24 hours after I arrived in Singapore that my travel delay claim has been processed. Saves me a lot of headache and hassle to submit document from the airline! 5 stars.  My 4 stars rating is due another medical claim which I waited for nearly 2 months to get approved after a trip back from China. The amount is quite small but took quite a long time to process - the customer service officers told me that period they have a huge amount of claims to process... so... but still. It could be improved."
5,"Lost my mobile phone and wallet due to theft. Made a police report with the local police station, came back SG and applied for claim. Etiqa got back to me in about a month and credited me with the amount promptly"
5,Recently I bought travel insurance with Etiqa for my Finland trip from 9 June to 16 June. I'm really impressed when they message me and said they will monitor the flight because there was a delay. This is the first time I received a message from a insurance company regarding flight delay even without me informing them! 
5,"Highly recommended for the reasonable price and ease of making claims.  My go-to insurance agent  for all my travel insurance needs for a few years now and have recommended their services to my friends and relatives. Their Tiq connect platform makes it easy to buy plans, check them, make claims and get paid through their ewallet, all from one simple location. What makes it better than the rest is the ease of making claims, all done online and no fuss, making it one of the best agents in my opinion.  For a few occasions where I needed to make claims, the application was approved within 5-6 hours of submission. Payment is received either via Tiqconnect ewallet almost instantly at the point of approval, or via cheque sent around 1-2 weeks later.  So fast and efficient.   They also have regular promo codes which makes it highly competitive. I have made comparisons with a few providers and found them to be the best with the lowest premium rates and good coverage. Thanks etiqa insurance! :) "
4,"I'm writing from my experience buying it on line. Easy to buy, simple and a non brainer. Price is also attractive and the coverage is very good for the price.  I cannot comment on the claim process because the trip was smooth and without incident and i hope i never need to file any claim.  cannot give 5 star because i cannot comment on claim process but based on the experience i've buying i believe should be hassle free and easy"
4,Usually the cheapest no-frills travel insurance. Buy via comparison site such as gobear for best promotion. 
5,"I purchased a travel insurance in April 2019 for a 4 days Cruise.  Little do I expects that it gave me the peace of mind when I falls sick on board.  I have headaches and was vomiting so much. Have no choice but to see the doctor on board.  I have no idea that medical cost could came up to S$400/= after the conversion.  What was most comforting is that the claim was approved in a couple of hours and credited to me within 24 hours! Super efficient, Super fast! Super good service! I'm glad that I bought the Travel insurance from Etiqa."
5,I‚Äôm impressed especially with the Etiqa ewallet. It enables me to receive claims as quick as lighting!   I submit a straight forward claim at 11am. Claims was approved by 2pm. And the claimed money was in by the next day morning in my ewallet! It was really easy and efficient. No questions asked as long as u produce requested documents. It was a breeze with the online portal. However just one mini inconvenience. I couldn‚Äôt upload my files on the mobile web version though.   Also! Etiqa insurance coverage extends to grandparents for their policy for travel inconvenience. My grandma was very ill previously that I had to stay in SG. Very thankful that I bought the travel insurance from etiqa once I purchase my flight. I manage to claim my flight and accommodation paid. The process was seamless! Consumers like myself could really save time on answering repeat questions from different persons or going through many emails to ensure the claims get through.   Kudos to Etiqa!  
5,"Last October, my flight got delayed for 16 hours. Thankfully I bought travel insurance, and even more thankfully, I bought it from Etiqa because I received my flight delay payout really quickly! The reporting process was easy and my request got approved in 2 hours. I was pleasantly surprised that I can receive the payout via PayNow. My friends were still waiting for updates from their insurer and I have completed the whole process.   Since then, I have been buying my travel insurance from Etiqa (because I know if I experience flight delay, I‚Äôm covered and the reporting process is seamless). Thumbs up! "
2,"Bought the 'Entry' Tiq Travel Insurance for my travel to China on 3-9 June 2019.   I was happy that the premium was among the lowest. The purchase process on their website was effortless.   I liked the 'automated flight delay benefit', just key in my flight details during purchasing and everything was automated.   I even received a farewell and welcome back to Singapore SMS, quite a personalised service.   However, what I was surprised that the coverage was lousy for 'Entry' Tiq Travel Insurance.   There was no coverage for quite a number of things such as 'Medical Expenses Incurred in Singapore', 'Home Content Cover', 'Hospital Visitation', 'Compassionate Visit'.   It was my fault that I did not read the Travel Insurance details properly. I thought the policy's benefits was similar to Etiqa that I bought a year ago. Never did I knew that after the name change from Etiqa to Tiq, the coverage/benefits had changed.   I was sicked after my overseas trip and I was unable to claim any medical expenses. My check-in luggage was also damage, there was no coverage for damaged luggage. "
5,I like that they are able to extend to grandparents with a real precise coverage that I need for my whole family . Plus this policy also allows  Coverage for Pre-Existing Medical Conditions which totally rocks and very beneficial !! 
5,"When my trip was unfortunately cancelled due to medical reasons, Tiq's instructions for supporting documents required were clear and I submitted my claims very promptly. I was also thankful to have received a call from a customer service officer who informed me that they were processing my claims and to follow-up on specific areas. Subsequently, I received my claims in 2 weeks. The entire process took less than a month and I was so glad I bought travel insurance!"
5,"Hassle-free and immediate travel claims encashment via PayNow by 'Insurer Claims ... BENEFITS, Comprehensive Plans for Full Protection."
4,"Pain-free claims process. Submitted claim, approved in 1 working day, paid out in same day.  Quite affordable, not the cheapest but great experience makes me a return customer."
5,"Was lucky enough to not have met any protest during my trip to Hong Kong, so can't comment on claims.  However, purchasing was easy.  To be honest, i had an offer from another insurance company but could not apply their discount code.  Etiqa auto applied my discount that they emailed me.  Reasonable and competitive pricing too.  Will buy again."
5,Easy to purchase and value for money as compared to many insurance companies. Thanks for the coverage.
5,I made a claim for flight delay and the on-line process was very easy and fast.  The claim was approved within a day and the claimed amount credited into my e-wallet the next day.  The credit in the e-wallet can be cashed out using Paynow.  Very simple and convenient! 
5,"Application is a breeze. Love it that Etiqa auto tracks flights  delays. Except for 70 year olds & older ones, Etiqa does offer peace of mind at reasonable prices. Thank you Etiqa for now,  I am still under 70."
5,Highly recommended to purchase Etiqa travel insurance when u travel. Price is comparable with other insurance provider. Surprising the claim process is hassle free and fast. üëç
5,Good Pricing with Good Coverage! Effortless online purchase! Straight forward claim process that provides maximum convenience to clients!

5,"I always buy Etiqa travel insurance when I travel. It is affordable and the claim process is hassle free and fast. My flight to Okinawa was delayed for 5hrs in Oct 2018, and my claim was automatically processed by Etiqa without me needing to do anything (since I input my flight no. when I purchased the travel insurance) . The money was credit into my Tiq connect account in a few days. "
5,I am truly IMPRESSED with your medical claim process via your online portal. I bought a ePROTECT travel plan for my trip and submitted my claim after discharged. The approval came within the day! I doubt anyone in the market can do that. Will recommend to my friends. Well done!
5,eTiqa travel insurance is easy to apply and coverage is good even with the basic plan. Claim is also easy via online submission and processing is fast. Will consider eTiqa for my future travels too.
4,I have bought travel insurance from Etiq twice within 6 months.  All I can said their service and processing claims time is excellent compared to other insurance providers.  Keep it up.
5,Been with Etiqa for 3 years and I like the fuss free submission of claim system. Claims are easy to submit and the turnaround time is short. Have been recommending Etiqa to my friends. 
5,"Probably the cheapest plan in the market for the coverage afforded. Simple and easy to book.  The claim process was efficient, allowing for the money to be paid within days of the claim itself. Super impressed and happy with this insurance!"
5,The app is easy to use. The claim process is simple and fast. Once my flight was delayed and claim pay check was received within one week. It is recommended.

5,Been buying their travel insurance. Cheap and good compared to other companies in same tier.  Customer service is excellent. Friendly n patient. Claim is fast. With option of leacing the credits in your account or cash out via chq ot pay now. 
5,"My luggage handle was terribly damaged when loaded onto the baggage collection belt in Munich. Requested for a claim under my Etiqa insurance and the process is easy to follow. And the claim was approved and cash in via paynow within less than 10hrs. With this I was able to get a replacement quickly. I have recommended my friends and colleagues to get Etiqa insurance, because the procedures and coverage are so much better."
5,A few plans to choose from and the price of the travel insurance is reasonable. Buying online is easy.  Need not have to contact any customer service personnel at all. Coverage is good enough.   Claim process is a breeze. Promo codes are available at times.
5,Application process is easy. Customer service is rather good. Claiming process is efficient. Value-for-money to me at least.
5,Arrived back in SIN to find my luggage damaged. Made a report at the airport office. Made a claim online the next day but experienced some problems and couldn't submit. Customer service was really helpful and solved my issues. Submitted the claim which was approved very promptly and the funds were credited into my tiq account.

5,The whole process is very smooth from purchase to activation...................................................
5,"Hassles free claim process and efficient process to get the amount in the bank account. Had to cancel my trip and airlines as well as ticket booking agency held back cancelling charges despite being informed on a medical emergency which prohibited flying for couple of months, prior to departure. Experience with Etiqa was simple and efficient. Would highly recommend for travel insurance experience."
5,Etiqa's claims and reimbursement process is the fastest I have ever seen.  I am worry free with high protection for my travel and I know it is not going to be a painful process if I ever needed to make any claims!
5,"Bought it first time for my Japan travel in Apr this year. Some cash was stolen during trip, not enough time to file police report. Back to Sg, via WA, advised to file in Sg. Did, claimed, approved quite fast - wow. Hassle free in buying, claim, reminder sms before I left & reachable via WA. Highly recommended!"

Keep up the good work and will definitely continue to support. Thank you!"

5,The application process was such a breeze. The price is economical I would say. Been using tiq travel insurance since 2017 and my recent 2019 Europe trip! I am comfortable with Etiqa. Their insurance policy is straightforward and understandable to read. ‚ù§Ô∏è

1,"bought a travel insurance with a wrong destination, Etiqa was unable to assist... my bad. I was keying in the info in a hurry hence did not pay attention to the destination... what a waste"

4,Definitely a value for money. Searched around for a good and comprehensive coverage and this is the best thus far. Easy to apply and fuss free. 
5,"Etiqa Insurance is one of the most trustable insurance companies. Their competitive pricing and informative website, made my insurance coverage affordable, swift and manageable. Few clicks away and I‚Äôm ready for my trip even if it‚Äôs at the last minute on the mobile-friendly site! Love the way they held promotions and keeping their visuals relational to their customers. In addition, claims process was effortless and prompt. Definitely will subscribe from Etiqa Insurance again in future. Introduced Etiqa Insurance to my family and colleagues, all of them felt the same. On one incident of lost of wallet, they credited full amount to me in less than a month after returning from the trip. TRUSTABLE & EFFICIENT! "
4,A great insurance to go for as it‚Äôs easily one of the cheapest in the market. Great for students going for exchange! Bought it for my daughter and thankfully no claim was needed.
5,Was introduce this by my Brother in law to purchase for my last trip with my family . I am Glad it covers pre existing health issues and have a great coverage for my elderly parents too !

5,Went to Korea and my mother had cold rashes. We went to the doctor and requested to claim from Etiqa. Etiqa made it so easy to claim! :)
5,Best value travel insurance with comprehensive coverage. Claims process was very fast and efficient the processing was done within two days and pay out was also very fast . 
5,Bought Etiqa Travel recently for a weekend work trip. It was very intuitive and easy to apply and get the insurance. Did not have to claim thankfully but would highly recommend it for it‚Äôs value!
4,My preferree choice when it comes to travel insurance as it is the most value for money and application is fuss free! Never had an encounter with claims before phew. 
5,My preferred travel insurance because it is the cheapest in the market and value for money. Everything is done online which makes it so efficient. 
5,Purchased Insurance for Trip to Japan.  Dropped phone but was able to repair up to $500.  Highly recommended and claimant process was fast and efficient.
5,Etiqa eProtect offers comprehensive coverage for all my travel needs and has a very fast claims process. I would highly recommend this to all my friends. Now got promotions some more. Enjoy up to 60% off single-trip and 40% off annual-trip travel insurance. Dont say BOJIO! Buy before 17 June! 
5,I lost my mobile phone in Athens recently. Submitted my claim within 3 days of my return ( attached the police report ). Received a positive reply from eTiQa the next day and got my cheque 1 week later. Very impressed with the fuss-free claims process. I will get all my future travel insurance from eTiQa for sure.
5,Recently travelled to italy and my connecting flights were delayed.   Submitted claim and it was approved in 2 days without any questions asked. WAY BETTER experience than another provider i was using for a previous trip - so now im using etiqa everytime im travelling. :)   Good job etiqa.
5,Bought for Dec 2018 trip. Luggage wheel damaged by Emirates. Bought me piece of luggage and claimed over USD 100 without fuss.
5,"Purchased Etiqa's ePROTECT travel insurance for my trip to Vietnam in April 2018. After using a promo code upon checking out, I only paid a premium of $25.97 which is a really great deal! Not sure of the claiming process since I didn't need to utilise it. But I like their automatic claim for flight delay. Overall, I would definitely purchase travel insurance from Etiqa again as it's value for money and hassle free."
4,"Have actually never bought travel insurance yet from Etiqa. Always from other online sources like bank promotions. But heard about Etiqa from friends and have checked them out. Looks very USER FRIENDLY, FAST application, coverage VALUE FOR MONEY. Will buy for my next trip, though i wish i wont have to feedback on the CLAIMS process though :)"
5,Bought Etiqa travel insurance for my last trip to Morocco. Their Thank Etiqa Its's Friday (TEIF) promo was a real steal. I'm able to get value for money protection and a competitive rate. The claim was easy and simple - all via online. The turn around time was very fast as well. I was able to settle my claims within 2 weeks. Will definitely purchase from Etiqa for my next trip!
5,"Easy to buy and easy to claim, highly recommended. It is also very cheap. Good for all kinds of travellers."
4,Bought a travel insurance from them for my recent overseas trip and claim for a damaged luggage was a breeze! Would definitely purchase from them in future! 
5,"Purchasing is a breeze especially the claiming part, i got my money within 2 days via the ewallet and encash is immediate. I have been purchasing travel insurance from etiqa since last year and even recommend to my family and friends "
5,"just bought eProtect Basic, let me comment the following, 1. online purchase interface - ease of use. I have encountered other online interfaces which are not so user-friendly, keep it up Etiqa and look forward to even better online experience. 2. premium - one of the most competitive in the market. 3. coverages - I would say insured amounts are reasonable based on such competitive premium. If one wants higher coverages, can go for higher tier package. conclusion - overall, satisfied customer, thank you Etiqa."
3,"Etiqa's travel insurance is priced competitively, among the lowest that I found.  However, I had mixed feelings over the claim experience in 2017 for my delayed baggage over at Indonesia. After filing my claim online, I received an acknowledgement email, which didn't state the turnout time. Since then, there's no update and after 1.5 months that I had to email and that's when it was mentioned 6-8 weeks. Shortly, the assigned claim officer informed me she did not receive the supporting documents which I uploaded online. She was understanding towards my frustration of re-sending the documents and upon receiving, she expedited and settled my claim the very next working day.  I hope the online experience can be improved, from the UI/UX to the online content. Otherwise, I am happy with the price and the customer service delivered by the claim officer."
4,"Etiqa's eProtect Travel plan has a very comprehensive coverage when travel abroad. I did a few comparisons but not every policies are well covered. So far, i still find Etiqa's eProtect Travel the best among others. I also love the mid year promotion that allows me to enjoy up to 60% off single-trip and 40% off annual-trip travel insurance with coupon code. "
4," Etiqa eprotect has a reasonable price and clearly states what it covers for. I really like that they tier the cost based on the destination of travel. Best of all, all claims can be received via PayNow!! I dont have to wait 2 weeks for a cheque and another 2 days to encash the cheque. Really speeds up the claim process. Good job Etiqa!"
5, Etiqa eProtect Travel Insurance can be easily bought at their outlet or online. I had a flight delay and was reimbursed quickly and efficiently. The process was straightforward and no back and forth which can be annoying. I like how they use technology to bring the best service to their customers like me! 
5,I had an accident whereby i was knocked down by motorist in Taiwan during my holiday back in 2016. I came back Singapore with  both local police report and hospital report. The rep was helpful through the phone and email to guide me along with my claim and also advised me to go for 2nd opinion as i have concerned for my knee joint which was impacted by the accident.  Eventually i was reimbursed for my medical expenses within less than 5 months and i am happy with their follow up service.  
5,"Recently, I bought a travel insurance. After compare with the rest, it is the cheapest and even without the promo code...It is unbelievable ! Coverage is almost the same but it is so simple and fast. With less than 30 minutes, all done and documents received Ôºåso efficient! Therefore I bought another insurance with Etiqa. "
4,"Purchased 2 eProtect travel policies from Etiqa for leisure trips to Japan and Vietnam as they offered the best value (better coverage for medical fees). No need to process any claims fortunately, purchase process was fuss-free and done online on the day prior to travel date. "
4,"Went to their outlet to enquire anout their product,The staff are friendly at allow me to go back and consider my decision , would consider them "
5,"Etiqa insurance is cheaper than other insurance companies and application is easy. I've bought my travel insurance from Etiqa twice for my trip, Penang and Taiwan. I was bitten by bed bugs in the airbnb in Penang. So i went to consult a doctor in Penang and submitted the claim once i'm back in Singapore. As it was my first time claiming, i can say that the claiming process is super fast, hassle-free and took 3 days to get back my full claim amount. Also, i just have to upload the required documents for the claim online without submitting the hardcopy. Also, the staff are efficient and reply fast to my enquiries. I definitely recommend everyone to use Etiqa!   Pros:  Value for money Fast claim process Website is user-friendly Efficient staffs  Cons:  So far no cons  "
5,I‚Äôve bought Etiqa‚Äôs home insurance and travel insurance in the last 6 months. Must say that they offer quite a cost competitive package compared to other insurance companies. What‚Äôs most important is their ease of signing up online and the creative UI & UX mobile friendly site. Feel free to compare their pricing and I‚Äôm sure you will understand where I‚Äôm coming from. Cheers!
5,"I brought Etiqa eprotect few months back ,and the consultant was really good to elaborate and anwer our enquiries promptly and so far no issue and price was reasonable and effortable so I guess no reason to reject. It was perfect and I recommend to my friends and family and some have a switch and its really awesome and hassle free.. "
4,Is the best insurance company i have with them esp fire insurance. Love it. They has provided great services for customers.
5,"Honestly, Im pretty impressed by them. They do have fast response time, great customer services, fast claim - the amount is credited into my ewallet with less than 24 hours despite they stated up to 3 working days. I had my claim in March after my korea trip.   Hope they continue to maintain their services. "
5,Purchase process was very simple. Purchased an annual plan and had to cancel a trip due to unforeseen medical reasons. Claim was submitted and approved within 24 hours! Amazing speed and hassle free process. Cheque received in the mail 2 weeks later.
5,"Went HK. Bought Etiqa family insurance 2 adult 2 kids for for just $30. Unfortunately (or fortunately) , flight really delayed 3 hours. Tired and reached sg already past 12am. The next morning 4 sms sent to my phone. Flight delay autoclaim, COOL! 2 week later, cheque $4x50=200 arrived.  Claim effort - Zero!    "
2,"All are good review, what about those who cant make it? i wonder what is their side of story. =/ i guess we will never know, if u dare to comment bad thing, u will be remove from the group. =("
1,"Was the best cash back card for a short period of time, until the terms were revised and now the card is sitting untouched in my drawer."
3,"A pity as it was the absolute best card previously with 10% cashback on dining, wine and online spending at $50 per category cap a year ago. Which means if you spend $500 across online and dining each, your cashback is a whopping $100 monthly!  Pity that the T&C was changed a few months ago, splitting the categories across the visa signature and mastercard, with increased minimum spending and lowered caps. Not recommended w the current blend of categories."
5,One of the few cards that has perpetual fee waiver. Definitely a card to keep solely because of the reason.
5,"Current the best cash back card since Q32018 with the renewed T&C till now:  Min Spend : $600  Cashback : 10% On Category: Wine and Dine, Grocery and Online  Note: Each category has a cashback cap of $50 Max cashback per month: $100 (all category combined)   Eg. Good if you:   1) Eat out a lot such as $300 2) Online shop up to $100 3) Grocery up to $200 This way you can achieve $600 monthly to get the cashback.   T&C at :  https://www.cimbbank.com.sg/content/dam/cimbsingapore/personal/cards/terms-and-conditions/tnc-visa-signature-20181018.pdf"
5,Used this card for on a monthly basis especially when you do a lot of online purchases. Just have to make sure that you are making 8 times purchases(min $30each) and min $500 spending monthly..the 10% cash rebate is really the highest in the market and the only sad thing is they capped it at 600 spending/mth so the max rebate you can get is only $60
4,Had this credit card when I signed for this and CIMB Platinum Mastercard.  It's 10% rebate on dining is an extremely good deal; however a minor set back is the need to clock $30 x 8 Expenditure in that month plus a total $500 spending for that month charged to the credit card. A bit difficult because I use paywave on smaller ticket items. It too has zero charges on admin fee for foreign currency like its sister Mastercard. Definitely a good card for dining people. Foreign spending on currency is also 10% though i didn't use this feature- more towards a dining person.  Overall a decent card which can match BOC in dining deals provided you spend often on the card. A must sign as well for new users given the awesome sign up gift CIMB has now (Spend $400 in first month to get $120 )
5,"Perfect for those who shop at overseas online shops in foreign currency and also love to dine out.  10% cash back on dining and overseas online shops with foreign currency spending. Even get 1% admin fee for foreign currency waived (they will credit back 1% into your bill). Minimum spending $500 per billing month with 8 transactions of $30, even get 0.3% rebates for top up EZlink card or other purchases. Cash rebates up to $60 per billing cycle credited into bill next month. Not many hoops to jump. Love it when I‚Äôve stuff to buy from online shops overseas. Their phone banking customer service is also friendly and quick to answer calls. That‚Äôs a bonus! "
4,"Pretty easy to manage billings, especially since I have a 365 account. Although, I feel that the min card spending can be lower given that there are competing products like DBS multiplier with no min spending. "
1,"When launch , marketed as dining card at 6% dining rebates on weekend and 3% on weekdays. Now lose out to BOX family card at 10% (but cap at $30) If you dine out a lot, use this card, otherwise combine all bills and use BOC Family card gets better cash back. "
3,Was good before they raised it to the $800 minimum spending. Used it before the increase to pair with my 360 Account but with the minimum forced increased spending it became difficult. 
4,"It is a very good credit card i almost for $60-80 every month but the condition of having to spend $500 is a pain to many and you will be tempted to spend more just to qualify. If you spend more than $500 then it is a good card to consider. Also they do charge annual fee on subsequent year, need to be mindful to call in to waive. "
1,"The rebates looks good, but theres really too many conditions, requirement for you to get the rebate. In this end, you probably wont be getting the most out of this card"
4,"Am on this card right now. Since it ties up with my OCBC 360 account. The 6% for dining on weekend was what encouraged me to stay with them.   At the moment, the con is that it is really difficult to track whatever I spend on their ibanking log-in. Despite paying the bills, it usually takes quite a while (2 weeks?) to appear on the app which seems as though you are exceeding your budget every month."
4,Good credit card. Highly recommended. Easy to unlocked the higher tier interest for OCBC 360 account 
5,"OCBC 365 credit is really good, because it has cash rebate of $80 after you full fill their criteria. Min spending of $800 per month and earn interest from different spending. "
5,"This card suit me as my spending are broad, it gives be $80 cash rebates every month. One thing bad is the rebate on the general spending which is 0.3%."
4,"This credit card is quite good, give you $80 rebate maximum per month. You can redeem 6% for dinning and some other stuffs. The only thing that not good is that you have to spend at least $800 to qualify for this reward. "
5,This card has the best cash back for dining. Use it for almost all the food and beverage I visit. It‚Äôs a Breeze without thinking or searching for good deal. The default card for dining
3,"Was using this card previously before I switched to DBS Live Fresh. If you have a OCBC 360 account, you should definitely use this card to hit the requirements for interest.  I like that the card has 6% weekend dining and discount at Esso!"
5,Recently came back on this card as I am consolidating all my spending together to save on the ease of paying and also stacking with additional interest for my ocbc360. Realised that this actually works well with my spending as i mainly spend on F&B as well!
1,Not competitive against other cards anymore and OCBC is not willing to waive off annual fees at all! Even though I have an account with them! Dropped it like a hot potato. 
1,"Held OCBC 365 for a couple of years, changes conditions of cashback multiple of times. The deal breaker is effective on 1st Oct 2018 where they removed 3% online spending and change to $800/mth min spending to qualify. Time to move on."
2,"Update in 2019  Pros: - Good as a tie-up card with the OCBC360 account - Decent cashback if criteria is met  Cons:  - Min spending requirement is hard to hit ($500 to qualify for interest under OCBC360, but $600 to qualify for higher amount of cashback.) - This has been increased to $800 which is bad for consumers - Min spending of $10,000 to qualify for waiver of annual fee - Poor customer service from customer service officers. One of the longest waiting time I have ever experience just to get through, with delayed call backs (can be for days) just to resolve issues with the credit card.  I have cancelled my card since late 2018."
1,"OCBC has the worst customer service. They have very strict fee waiver policies for their credit cards.  And, if you accidentally forgot to pay your cc bills on time or if there is a technical delay over inter-bank payments, they will charge you late payment. If you do not hit the minimum spending $900/mth, you will be charged annual fee and you can't waive it off. So, no matter how much you try to earn the rebates and meet the 360 account conditions, it will be all gone with these strict annual fee and late payment charge. Also, it is known that the OCBC CSOs should not waive fee liberally.  So, avoid at all cost!!!"
4,"Decent product and generally fuss free- I use this mainly for dining out with friends (so minimum $600 is much easier to hit) and other misc things like groceries, grab rides etc."
2,the rebates for this card used to be good but it‚Äôs getting worse and worse now. They keep changing the terms and conditions and it‚Äôs frustrating. So much for #staytrue. Please stay true to giving your customers the best value and rebates and stop hiding behind this marketing crap.
2,"Some of the good parts of this card, 1. you can link the Credit Card to your 360 savings account, making this a Credit Card and an ATM card. 2. nice package with 360 account 3. decent cashback if criteria is met   Here comes the not so good part:  - i had a terrible terrible experience with their customer service. at first, they refuse to waive the annual fee. i refuse to pay. after 1 month, they add on ""Late Fee"" and ""Interest"" on top of that. it doesn't help with the fact that I was working in UK for 4 months and the time differences makes it extremely difficult to contact the hotline rep. - They only have 1 channel of customer service, which is hotline. No email - Min spending requirement is hard to hit ($500 to qualify for interest under OCBC360, but $600 to qualify for higher amount of cashback) - Min spending of $10,000 to qualify for waiver of annual fee show less "
4,"Great rebates I enjoy for Dining 6% sat and Sun, 3% Mon to Fri and Petrol 5%, with minimum of $600 spending each month. Will use only for these categories as they give best rebates!"
3,"I applied for this card because of OCBC360. I used this as dining card for its 6% cashback on weekend dining and 3% on weekdays, as well as grocery. For some dining partners, you may receive additional discounts as well.   But the minimum spending of $600 can be difficult to achieve. However, compared to UOBOne, which requires me to spend $500 each for three consecutive months in order to get the cashback at 3.33%, this is easier to achieve. "
3,"A great card which has great cashbacks on petro at ESSO. As a Starhub Mobile Subscriber, you could get 3% cash back too. In addition, there is a 6% cash back on weekend dining and 3% cash back on online spending with a minimum spend of $600 which is a con. "
4,A great card for my groceries shopping as it can easily exceed the $600. Fair rebate given and it is convenient and fuss free. 
5,"It is one of the great card to own it as the rebate system makes me spend even more.   As i spend more for petrol and essentials bills, the rebates allows me to earned more at the same time."
3,"Use it to tie in with 360 account but minimum spending of $600 is still a stretch for me. The rebates of groceries, online spending and Telco rebate is what attracted but switching to Circles soon. BOC/POSB Everyday seems like a good next choice hmmm"
3,"Good starter card as they do not limit category cashback caps. However, realistic achievable cashback is only about 20-30 a month for mere mortal spending."
4,"I have scattered spending pattern where I don't spend a whole lot on 1 particular category, which can hit $600 with some purchases with no extra rebate.. I actually like this card as it suits my lifestyle. I have StarHub HomeHub, which benefits from 3% telco rebate +3% starhub ocbc rebate, 6% on weekend dining, 3% on online shopping, Grab rides and some grocery shopping. When paired with OCBC 360 account, the rebates and interest is quite attractive for me to stay for now. I will still keep this as my primary card for now, as it suits my spending pattern."
3,"This card is only useful for recurring telco bill (3% cash back), weekend dining (6% cash back) and online spending (3% cash back) but there is a minimum spend of $600."
3,"Since the ocbc360 account lost its shine compared to dbs multiplier, I've been using this card lesser. Think it's still ok for extra interest with bill payments, and sometimes there're promos for when you grow your balance month on month.   I also like that ocbc cards in general have quite alot of dining partners.   But unfortunately their customer service is not v flexible and their web/app user interface loses out to dbs/posb."
1,"Card started out decent, then got battered hard by BOC Family card and never recovered from there. This card is suffering a slow demise. Headline rates of 6% dining rebate on weekend and 3% on weekdays, with a minimum spending of $600, is really a bad combo. Come on, even BOC Family which got nerfed badly, also gives a whopping 10% dining rebate anytime of the day with minimum spending of $700. If $700 is too much, you can use a miles card such as OCBC Titanium rewards (using Samsung MST) and UOB Preferred Platinum Visa (using paywave) to get 4 miles per dollar of spending with no minimum spending, which beats those rebate rates above (arguably except the 10% one). This 365 card just doesn't fit the spending profile of anyone right now and if no improvements are made, no one will take this card unless there's a lack of knowledge on the user's end."
3,"Main strength of ocbc365 is it's 6% dining rebates on weekend and 3% on weekdays.  If you are those who dine frequently outside (including at Mac) or a cafe hopper, ocbc 365 will be good choice. However the BOC family card, is now the better competitor out there against it."
3,"After countless hours of research, this is the first credit card I applied during my first job. It has been marketed as a 'dining card' with a 6% cashback for weekend dining. Minimum spending of $600 is not on the high side as well. Initially I thought this card would fit my spending habits perfectly. However as I read up more on savings and investing, less financial damage was inflicted by my dine out habits. Thus this card does not serve my purpose as much now.  There are numerous credit cards out there offering >3% for groceries/online shopping. Probably going to switch over to some other card(s) soon despite the sentimental values of 365.  "
1,"Not a huge fan of this card, the main perk being the 6% cashback for weekend dining - which you only get if you hit their minimum spend of $600 a month. I have had this for about 2 years and was a day late for a month and they simply refused to waive the late fee - had to give them a big talking-to over the phone before they agreed. Just had an annual fee levied and again, they are refusing to waive it. Overall abysmal customer service from OCBC. Think twice before applying!   Probably only good if you want to pair it with an OCBC360 account, which I dropped like a hot potato once BOC came up with their SmartSaver account some years back."
4,"Been using this card for the past 3 years as it‚Äôs tied to my OCBC 360 account. It‚Äôs a pretty good card as the rebates are pretty good for general spending. However, I‚Äôm slowly switching to UOB One for more attractive interest rates. "
5,"I have been purchasing from Allianz since early this year (2018). Used to buy from OCBC (Great Eastern) due to 25%/50% off premiums if you're a OCBC card holder but with all the recent spate of regional unrest (N. Korea and all) decided to grab a travel insurance with terrorism coverage.  MSIG & Allianz stood out when it comes to Terrorism coverage.  For comparison purposes, both insurance quote for single trip, 10 days Asean country for 1 adult below 70yo. MSIG Elite ($39 first 3 days, $5/day thereafter total $74; add in 50% discount off = $37) vs Allianz Single trip silver ($32.45 discounted price; before was $59) Allianz wins in terms of value for me because I focus more on medical expenses/theft etc.. A short comparison of benefits that matters more to me as below:  Overseas emergency due to sickness/accident: MSIG $500,000 vs Allianz $1,000,000 Overseas Emergency Dental: MSIG $6000 vs Allianz 1,000,000 TCM treatment: MSIG $400 (never indicate local or overseas) vs Allianz $300 each for local & overseas Delayed luggage: MSIG $250/6hrs capped at $1000 vs Allianz $200/6 hrs capped at $1400 Loss or damage to luggage: MSIG $5000 vs Allianz $6000 (both $1000 for laptop and other effects capped at $500 each) Flight diversion: MSIG $100 vs Allianz $200 every 6 hrs Terrorism: MSIG $200,000 vs Allianz $80,000 Accidental death and perm total disability: MSIG $200,000 (non specified) vs Allianz $80,000 + 80,000 (death on commercial flight)  So far I've been lucky not to use the hotline for claims but I have called them a few times to clarify on some doubts and the customer service knows their stuffs well =)"
5,"When you're travelling abroad, Allianz Global Assistance Singapore travel insurance allows you to travel with confidence. You can enjoy peace of mind, safe in the knowledge you're backed by a responsive and caring support team from a company that is a global leader in insurance."
4,"Don't have much complains about Allianz Travel. Purchasing was fuss free, claiming was relatively easy, customer service could be better but my claims we resolves quickly"
4,Signed up for an annual plan with them because I travel more than twice a year and they're the only company that covers adventure/outdoor activities such as hiking and winter sports without additional charge! 
1,"I travelled using Allianz last year to Japan.  During my flight back, my flight was delayed and I applied for a travel delay claims. My experience was less than enjoyable.  - The online claim self service submission portal do not work properly and I have to try submitting the claims multiple times. - To ensure i submitted, i emailed the team too. - Allianz replied to ask me to submit it online despite me emailing in and telling them I cant. So i tried online again and screenshot the error to them and tell them I have to submit manually. - After they received my email, i have not heard from them for 2 weeks on whether my claim has been approved / rejected, and I had to email them. - Only when I chased, and they tell me that they will process it. - My partner's travel insurance was with another provider, and it was approved in 24 hours within the online submission.  - While I managed to get my travel claims, i had to deal with multiple back and forth and actively chase them for an update.  - One thing's for sure, I'm not using Allianz for my travel insurance anymore."
1,"Promised use of free software which he claims he developed himself, but he did not say it was free only for the duration of the course. After the course you have to pay to subscribe or pay to attend higher level courses.  Claims to have developed many different ""styles"" of investing, but in actual fact, it is just giving his own name to what is already available in public.  Throughout the 5 days, more than half the time he talks about some other stories, and upselling his other courses. Not much time is dedicated to real teaching. And after the 5 days, you will often receive emails from him promoting other investment ""courses"".  Recommend to avoid, unless you have spare cash (>$1000) to throw and don't mind listening to an old man boasting about himself. "
1,"Many of friends attended and paid several $KKK for his so call advance course, but all dropouts because the course was not practical and a waste of time and $$$ By all means stay far away from it,  If anyone really interested in learning trading in stock, try attending ""Homily"" free seminars and check out their powerful software and course content b4 joining them. FYI, most of Dr Tee clients went to join Homily and find the teaching a world of difference. I am not a sales staff of Homily and had no vested interest in the company it, I was just a fortunate student who join them and make some Kopi money.. Their class from Basic, Intermediate, Advance  until Master students level."
1,"not very useful, long winded and repetitive. Hardcore selling, wont recommend anyone to join the course. "
5,"Customer service beyond the ordinary  With a customer satisfaction rating of more than 90%, rest assured we will be there for you when you need us most."
5,Website very straightforward and easy to navigate. Insurance rates are very much affordable and I would highly recommend all to consider Direct Asia. Love that they still send me SMS every year on my birthday. 
4,Not too bad. Website is fairly easy to use and get quotations instantly. Suitable for non frill coverage. 
5,It's a value for money option with hassle free and quick sign up online. Coverage is sufficient as well.
5,Quick and fuss free application - the whole process took me less than 5 mins to complete.  Rates given were quite competitive as well. 
4,"Extremely happy with Direct Asia, have renewed already with them. Had to claim a trip due to an injury and it was a breeze and was paid in a week. They are also pretty much the only ones I found that cover extreme sports (not for competition purposes)  I did see my premium go up a bit - so do take not of that."
5,"Chose Sunseap as they were giving the highest discount off tariff(DOT) short term 6 months plan back in December 2018 as I expected the SP tariff to fall. In May 2019, realized fixed plans prices did not match the fall in SP tariff dropped(did not reduce by the same extent) so I opted to renew my contract with Sunseap by going for 24 months fixed rate of $0.1775/kWh. Supported Sunseap as they are a local SG solar company with big plans for Asia:  my way of helping them achieve their goals. 1% solar energy may seem like a small bit, but if everyone does it, it can go a long way:) "
1,Changed to Sunseap 6 month plan.  I could not see any different cost of billing since SP GROUP.  Like the email billing and communication though.  but ultimately as consumer we would like to see some discount.   not sure where the saving goes.   Hope they can improve i don't mind to try again if things improve.   Sorry for now....lower star grading.
1,"After I setup my credit card for recurring reduction, I got credit card fraud first time in my entire life, might be a coincident, but I don't think so. Today I get a contract renewal email from them, stating my contract was renew from July onward. I had already indicate that I'm not renewing the contract since June and went for another company. New company works with SP bill and had already started billing me, now I have to deal with this nonsense."
5,"Sunseap has the best price in terms of the entire package. Signed a 6 months, not the lowest rate but with the  $30 rebates. Its much cheaper overall than other energy companies which dont provide rebates"
4,"Actually, I have been a customer of Sunseap for a few months already. So far, everything has been smooth (other than the delayed responses etc)  In terms of monetary savings, I cannot expect much as I signed up for 100% solar energy plan. But I knew that in mind when signing up for this plan."
2,"Billing was confusing. Support was non-existent. Took a month over to finally get in touch with someone. Email replies are copied and pasted million times over. Billing dept refuses to speak until fb post is made. Accorded a $20 rebate in lieu of the convenience caused. Overall, terrible experience for the hype."
5,"Made 2 referrals successfully and will be making a 3rd referral. Rewards for me, $20 rebates. Does SP give you rebates all these years? NO. Only increase of electricity,  water and gas charges. Dun let SP take away more money with excuses of oil charges increase."
5,"Switched over to senoko early this year and it‚Äôs probably the best decision. The switch was easy and smooth, no impact or troubles to manage. Since then I have recommended my family and friends to do the same. "
5,Definitely one of the lowest fixed price plan! Fuss free and seamless transition! Highly recommended 
5,The application process was easy and straightforward. Even gotten my parents to switch to Senoko. On top of that the invoice is clear with every details. Thumb up!
3,I got my bill quite late after sp bill until I thought what was going on. Credit card also don't know when will be deducted. 
5,"Being on senoko since April, so far no issue. There was some confusion on the credit card promotion when I signed up as the instructions wasn't clear on how to get those rebates. But it was sorted out by their kind agent. If you can get good signup rebate, just go for it."
5,"After the launch of OEM, Senoko is my only choice and thereafter is history. It is a reputable and reliable company as it has its own generation plant. Secondly rate is competitive. Lastly change is no hassel at all.  What are you waiting for? Go for OEM, go for Senoko!"
5,"Made the switch to Senoko Energy based on the following reasons:  1) Strong history & reliability Senoko Energy is a local brand with a good track record since 1976. Very stable and they have their own power plant too.  2) Competitive plans I signed up with them in May when they were offering 17.78¬¢/kWh for 24-month fixed rate plan. It was the lowest 24-mth fixed rate plan then and I got to enjoy a $60 bill rebate.  3) No hidden fees No security deposit, transmission loss charges or carbon tax. 17.78cents all inclusive.  4) Bank promo Was able to link my OCBC card to enjoy a $40 cashback and additional 3% monthly rebate with OCBC 365 credit card.  5) Extra friend referral rebate I was referred in by a friend so I got to enjoy an additional $20 bill rebate (my friend enjoy an extra $20 too)  Switch early and don't let yourself be susceptible to SP's fluctuating electricity prices! üí°"
5,I chose to apply Senoko mainly because of no hidden fees and can linked to my OCBC bank card for billing to get rebates.
5,"Always liked the idea of having a smart home. My wife and I stumbled upon the EMA roadshow one day and Senoko Energy was giving away a smart plug with every sign-up. Thought this was good because my wife always charges her devices overnight and that wastes quite a bit of electricity.   Roadshow guy also gave us a discount code (only for Senoko customers) to buy more smart home products, so we also managed to get a motion sensor for the kitchen at a really reasonable price.  Glad to have chosen Senoko Energy.  "
5,"Super smooth sign up experience! Had a couple of questions on the OEM prior to signing up, and spoke with the customer service folks - they were patient and very helpful. And thank goodness they told me about Senoko's referral programme! I've referred 4 friends and have received $20 rebate per referral WOOHOO!   Plus they always have giveaways on their FB and IG pages, so I religiously follow them for chances to win extra perks :)"
4,The switch to Senoko is simple and easy. The agent is responsive and polite in explaining the details of the billing. I even recommend my relatives and my siblings of this service and now they are all using Senoko Electricity.
5,We switched over to Senoko May19 this year and it‚Äôs definitely the best decision. The switch was easy and can say totally no impact or troubles to our account and really saved up to 30% monthly.  I have recommended my friends to switch to Senoko too.
5,"Competitive pricing, signed up when I could stack the rebate on top of credit card promotion. So far so good, love that they have an app."
1,worst experience. Took 1 year plan with SC promotion. They did not give 50$ promotion offer. Escalated many times but no help. Dont take plan of this company please
5,"Love their mobile app, so clear and i can pay bills through it too! just signed up, the hv the lowest rate for 24-month fixed plan at 17.72. Plus, i got the UOB One rebate, $40 one-time rebate and monthly 5% rebate"
5,"In short: Managed to enjoy the most seamless claim experience when i was stressed out over losing my valuables in Europe.   10/10 will pay for Tokio Marine Travel Insurance, even if it's a little bit more expensive, to feel completely safe and at ease overseas"
5,Had a great experience when I had to make a claim for a flight delay during my last trip. They provided prompt response and subsequent follow-ups to my case.
5,Save up to 55% on Travel Insurance with the Best Suited Plan. Find out now. We're Making it Simple to Choose the Right Insurance and Banking Products for You. Unbiased Comparison.
3,"Claim process can be improved. Claim process is split into 3 parts:1. Submission of claims online 2. Wait for email to inform you on the document s to be submitted and have to snail mail original hard copy3. Claims approved , cheque will be mailed by post. Too inefficient considering this present digital . Etiqa and FWD allows online submission and claim and document s and process can be completed in 3 days compared to TM which took 2 weeks"
5,Application process is fuss free. I applied for Annual plan with 20percent discount. I bought the policy the night before I flew. Got it done within 5mins. 
1,"Choose wisely..  For 15000 units, earn rm325 just get back sgd13. Trading in Singapore shares still just average.  But if trading for overseas, just beware.. Trade at your own risk. "
5,The mortgage staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Follow up tightly with the customer even after the plan is signed. Professional and good experience overall.
5,"Ocbc Mortgage Insurance is a term plan which cover the loan amount for the required loan term, no matter is HDB or condo. The good thing about the private insurance is that no matter you sell your property later, the insurance will still remain coverage. "
5,"Low management fee - 0.65% p.a. and interesting risk-based approach.  Started an account when they just launched, and deposited more with their promo ($10 incentives every $1k deposit). So far the portfolio's doing well "
5,"Overall, I had a very positive experience, Would recommend this to investors who wishes to sit back and enjoy the automation of investing at an extremely low cost, especially for beginners. Platform is easy to use and transactions are straightforward. I reached out to customer service and have always gotten the help needed.  Highly recommended!!!"
5,My parents almost signed up with others who said they have no hidden fees. Luckily we found out in time that there were charges for paper bills (so much for no hidden fees)! We called PacificLight and were reassured that they did not charge for paper bills and we are happy with our choice.
5,"Easy signup process! And i get to enjoy cool savings with Promo code rebates + Referral + Credit Cards Recurring Payment! Plus, their customer service officer Benjamin was so helpful and clear with his explanations when i called up to check on my bill payment! "
5,"No need much to convince! I can see that Pacific Light makes great effort over time to become very competitive amid stiff fights with over ten other players! Today, they are super where consumers benefited most! Lots of $ savings and hassle-free to switch to Pacific Light."
5,"no reason for not giving a full star rating simple signup process with great promo and package no hidden cost, whatever cost is written down on flyers the best part is no charge for paper copy bill prompt and professional customer service highly recommended"
5,"Not only am I delighted with e awesome deal provided by Pacific Light, I am also impressed with e great expertise and efficiency of e team for ensuring a smooth and effortless sign up. They win hands down on greater rebates and savings! No regrets choosing them as my provider üëçüèª‚ù§Ô∏è thank you Pacific Light!"
5,"Easy sign up process and helped me to lighten my financial burden! Great customer service too, totally recommend to switch to PL! üëçüèº "
5,"Fast response from customer service and having competitive rates in the market, most importantly, no hidden cost. "
5,Super competitive and awesome customer service. Most importantly no hidden charges unlike other retailers. 
5,The online sign up smooth and easy! Saved alot since i sign up with PacificLight. awesome customer service too!! :)
5,"Good Customer Service. Unlike many other retailer whom you cant get through on the customer service line and have to wait for almost an hour or 2 to get through, Pacificlight seems to have gotten their priorities right. Also, follow-ups are very prompt. "
5,Website sign up was smooth. I've been saving around $40 every month ever since I switched to PacificLight. Their referral program is very useful as well! 
5,"I've switched to PacificLight since January this year, and it sure helped me save a lot on my electricity bills! What I like about PacificLight? Definitely their friendly customer service staff and the exclusive promos sent to my email every now and then!"
5,I use pacific light for my family. I think is really good because their service is perfect and awesome.
5,"The best and attractive is no paper bill charge, no hidden cost unlike other retailers. easy online signup. Prompt customer service and solution. I experienced recurring issue, they put effort calling me and solved the problem in day. No recurring deduction failure charge, unlike some ither retailers. Highly recommended. "
1,"We have not paid utility bill more than 200sgd in the past 5 years. it consistently ranged from 150-180. Ever since the switch to pacific light, our utility bills from SP and Pacific light, now add up to more than 220 sgd EVERY SINGLE MONTH WITHOUT FAIL. We were made to sign up a 2 year contract since it gives the lowest price per watt. And now? completely stuck. Tried to understand why is that so but the service line takes forever to connect and the response is slow and unsatisfactory. Please avoid. "
5,I like it that it's easy to sign up online and they never forget to give perks to their customers after signing up.  I can use the referral programme and enjoy AMEX promotions to make my electricity cost FREE. There are also lucky draw chances. 
5,Their customer service is very patient and calm when I was making a fuss. Call was pick up fast and the explanation was clear. 
5,"We have been using worldfirst since 2019 and they offer the best rates for USD ever since they have made some changes to the pricing model. Besides that, they also treat their customers really well. Nothing to complain about and just praises for this company. Highly recommended if you want to have the highest exchange rate for usd :)  "
5,JQ was very helpful during the whole process of getting me started to make my first payment using World First.  Great service and keep up the good work!
5,"This is the best service so far. Easy to use, friendly customer service, reliable, trustworthy and most important, BEST RATE!"
5,"My experiences with WorldFirst had been very satisfactory to-date. I had used WorldFirst for different currency pairs transactions to different offshore parties in the past years. These transactions had been well executed. I can track my transactions online and on top of that. WorldFirst customer service team, be it in Singapore or UK, provides great 24X7 follow-up. My dedicated Account Manager is also very commendable.  WorldFirst daily updates via email is another useful mechanism for me to get updates on the forex market.  Overall, WorldFirst is a reliable option for my remittances. "
5,"WorldFirst is one of the first money transfer service I signed up. What I really like about them is that you have a dedicated person who can assist with your enquiries. As I'm using WorldFirst not only for personal transfers but for business transfers as well, this is extremely important. "
5,I've been using worldfirst for a number of years now. The transfer process is very easy and I've always been impressed by the excellent rates available.
5,"I worked in Hong Kong for a bit over two years and used WorldFirst to send money back to Australia.  A few years earlier I'd used another company (XE) for another currency transaction, and while I was happy with them at the time I found that WorldFirst without fail provides a better result (HKD to AUD at least).  On the very rare occasions where I've needed to contact WorldFirst their responses have been lightning fast and very helpful.  I was really impressed with them yesterday when I was clearing out a small amount from my Hong Kong account and I made an error in not allowing for the low transaction amount charge.  I had a response from them within a few minutes simply waiving the fee!  I'm very happy to recommend them."
5,"When I moved to Australia a year and a half ago, I was worried about how I was going to transfer funds from Singapore to Australia. Banks international transfer rates were high and not cheap. So I was relieved and glad to have found WorldFirst  online. The process to set up an account was straight-forward and done via a video call. Their website is super user-friendly, with clear and concise information, making it a breeze to use. Most importantly, their transactions are smooth, credible and punctual. This gives me an ease of mind knowing that I will receive the funds in the bank account at the proposed date. I hope there will be more country currencies added in the future!"
5,World First has help me in getting my purchase of an apartment in Japan with ease due to their easy remittance of money. Not forgetting the reasonable exchange rate given. Fast transfer of money to the receiving party in Japan. Recommended. World First staff is very helpful for my first account setting up and money transfer.
5,Easy and Fuss Free Transfer. Enjoyed great rates and lower commissions compared to other platforms! Will transfer again. Thank you!!
5,"World First provides a efficient way to do business abroad with foreign currency, I have no issue at all and no hidden costs. "
5,Excellent customer service where the whole process of moving money can be assisted with just a phone call. The margin charge matches or sometimes smaller then bank even as a premier banking customer. Absolutely a preferred choice in moving my money overseas.
5,"Simple, straightforward, and most importantly there are no hidden costs.  I have used a few different means to transfer currency and by far WorldFirst offers the best value. "
5,Worldfirst gives me great convenience in remitting funds across borders.  As I travel a lot I can work with world first wherever I am remotely.  
5,"I have used WorldFirst services for 4 times.  Was skeptical at first but found it easy, reliable and quick.  I'm sold and would highly recommend using their services.  Thank you for the impeccable timely delivery üëç"
5,"Safe and solid choice.   Professional, friendly, prompt and honest service.   Reliable and trustworthy exchange rates.   I have been using World First the past one year and very satisfied with the service."
5,When it comes to international money transfers of any size I don‚Äôt look anywhere else. Extremely pleasant to deal with and super smooth transactions with competitive exchange rates.
5,"Professional, friendly, prompt and honest service. Great exchange rates and no hidden costs. Been using World First for 6 years now."
5,Good service by lyn and their staff. Got my money way sooner then expected and the rates were pretty good. Have been using them for some time with no issues at all. Recommended
5,Good service. Ben was professional in trading. Answered all my questions patiently. Hope that the new 0.5 will not affect too much of trade.
5,Quick and easy way for me to pay USD to my local tour operator in Maldives (which has way better rates than local operators or booking directly through the resorts. Saves me money on every front!
5,"Reliable, competitive exchange rates and efficient service with professionalism. Helpful staff. Warm and friendly!"
5,An easy and fast way of transferring funds. My account manager had been most helpful with my needs. Highly recommended.
5,"Easy, simple and transparent way for international transfer. Have been using it for my child oversea educcation and living expenses. üëç"
5,Excellent service and good rates.  Will definitely recommend more friends and business associates to use WorldFirst.
5,"Good exchange rates, fast remittance and reliable friendly service. I have been a client for many years and recommend to people"
5,Love the convenience.  It is a lot easier than any other methods I've used in the past.  The exchange rate is highly competitive.  So far better than all other similar companies out there.  Never go to the bank for foreign currency exchange.  You will get ripped. The phone support is also great. 
5,Super efficient and reliable agency. Been using them for quite numbers of years. Will recommend to all my family and friends 
4,"I have been using conventional way for my remittance thru banks internet banking prior intro to World First, I regretted of not knowing them earlier.  Their rates are relatively very good and at time, better then money changer if you intend to remit larger amount.  Cindy, my accounts manager response very promptly and giving her best personal attention.   With their service, I have been recommending to my friend to consider opening account with them instead of thru bank.  Thanks Cindy, thanks World First. "
4,Huge savings on our cross border payments. Started using this year. Like the fact that they have an office presence in SG & we are assigned a local dealer to help with anything with just a phone call in addition to online support.  Worldfirst compliance is strict! They require us to produce our invoice as proof for our first supplier payment. This maybe a hassle but  it‚Äôs a good policy to have. 
5,"I used to use my bank to transfer money to an account back home in the USA, but now that I have discovered WorldFirst, it's much faster and cheaper to use!"
5,"Kudos for fast support, and assigned manager. They respond really fast, and they are extremely helpful! And also, best rates for transfers"
5,If you are serious about eCommerce and not using WorldFirst as your No.1 foreign currency solutions provider you are seriously leaving money on the table ! Manage inbound / outbound foreign currency with ease and start saving big with Worldfirst TODAY.
5,Chio bu manager assisting you been using them since 2018 and so far user friendly no trouble transfer from PayPal to bank. Recommended 
5,"I have been using WorldFirst for my online business transactions for the past few years.  Before that, I had Paypal and Clickbank sending payment direct to my corporate account, thereby incurring very inferior FX rates. After a recommendation from a friend, I tried WorldFirst and was impressed with their superior FX rates.  Even my staff in Philippines were impressed, as they get more salary in PHP currency after I send them the USD via WordFirst instead of PayPal.  The other thing I like about WorldFirst is their customer service. They have an office in Singapore and a staff who is ready to answer my questions (Thanks JQ!!)  And because they are very anti-money laundering, there are some minor inconveniences like having to verify that I‚Äôm a real person (via a quick webcam call). And I have to send documents showing that I‚Äôm sending salary to my staff, as a one-off check. But because of this, I am certain these due diligences will ensure my account with them is safe - and my account won‚Äôt get suspended/frozen for no reason.  For online businesses that use USD as their main currency, I would strongly recommend WorldFirst."
5,A very user-friendly platform and professional service. Not forgetting the client managers are both helpful and willing to go an extra mile. We have been using Worldfirst for coming to 3 years.
5,"User friendly system , responsive and helpful account manager, fast and efficient remittance service."
5,Best Rates Ever!  Worldfirst never fails to deliver great rates for cross border businesses. With great support and customer service you will always be in good hands.
4,"Been using WorldFirst for 2 years, overall satisfied with the service. The the exchange rate isn't the best."
5,"Great exchange rates,  very fast transfer and excellent customer service. You have an dedicated  account manager to look after you. However the rate alerts didn‚Äôt work sometimes, so missed out the better rates. "
5,"4.5 stars. Overall, the online service is smooth and easy to use. I've also received the help I needed whenever I called. However, the exchange rate isn't very competitive. Not bad, but not great either. I like that Worldfirst doesn't charge a wire fee (one reason why I support them), but my bank that I'm transferring to does. While this isn't Worldfirst's problem, I rather look for other ways to transfer money overseas first before using WF. But overall I have no conplaints with it per se."
5,"Amazing service, my account manager helped me through the process from start to finish. Super cheap rates!!!"
4,Using this as my main CC as my spending habits are mostly online and paywave purchases. It'll be even better if they could increase their cash back percentage.
1,"History:  Used to use this as the clubbing card, then get lessor use.  It used to be the grey traditional card face that you see here on the top left, more than 6 months ago it tries to copy OCBC Frank CC to modernize the looks and tries to be the lifestyle card for party goers.   Only Cons:  1) Min $600 spend and It used to be 10% cash back, now only 5% cashback on Online Shopping & Visa payWave purchases (Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay) .. BAD!   2) With effect from 1 June 2018, the monthly cashback earned on DBS Live Fresh Card will be capped at S$20 on eligible Online spend, S$20 on eligible Visa payWave spend and S$20 on all other spend. Question is , how many of your transaction can be onn apple / samsung / visa paywave other than retails ! => Hence render it useless if you compare to BOC Family card. "
2,"I am not getting accurate cashback amount. On alternate months I only receive very little, like $0.19 or $0.34 for my Visa Paywave/ Online expenses when I definitely hit a few hundreds per category.  When I do receive the monthly cashback it's usually maxed out at $20 for each category. I spend about $1000 every month on this card, so there's definitely an error there. Will send an email to DBS team and will update here again later."
3,"Yays  1. Great for fulfilling the multiplier ""credit card spend"" requirement, where even a $1 spend qualifies  2. DBS is great. You never know what exciting promotion will come up next. Perhaps they may reverse their cashback reduction, or something better. And their live chat service is excellent. You no longer have to endure long calls with multiple hurdles to get the answer you want or the help you need.   Nays  1. 10% flat cashback but now 5%, with a $20 cap on each of three sub-categories.  2. $600 minimum spend "
4,"My first credit card I signed. The cashback was great and the min spend for higher cashback is reasonable. Slight turn off when they revised the cash back condition by setting limit to each category. However, still a credit card to use to hit the spending category for DBS multiplier."
3,"I don't spend very much so it's hard for me to meet the minimum spend to maximise my cashback on this card. But it's currently the best card for me since I'm using the DBS Multiplier account and I get extra interest when I spend on DBS credit cards.  Quite a useful card to use especially when you are about to go on holiday > book Airbnb / Agoda + Flights , make payment online, usually you'll hit the minimum $600 to maximise your cashback."
3,"Love the cashback from this card. However, ever since they have amended their t&c, obtaining the full cashback is much more difficult."
4,"Sign-up promo of 10% cashback is good. However, one downside is that it have to hit the minimum spends of 600 dollars, which is quite high. "
4,"The 5+5 % cashback, accompanied by $50 sign up promo enticed me to sign this card up. As a young working adult, the minimum spend is a bit high and limiting as it only works for contactless payment and online. Nevertheless, the 10% is still enticing. But may stop using it as theyjust changed the terms and condition from 1st June onwards"
2,"When I first applied for this card, it was initially a points card where I could use the rewards points to redeem cheap thrills like movie tickets and restaurant vouchers. And it used to have a very long waiver period (think it was three or five years).   It was changed to a cashback card around a year or two ago. As I could never match the spending requirement of $600, its cashback was only sufficient to cover my card charges (because i exceeded the waiver period). The waiver period got much shorter (1 year only). Its visa debit is a better alternative for paywave.   Possible benefits? It's fuss-free to apply. DBS is likely to waive your annual credit charges if you are a current user of DBS services. Otherwise, there is better option out there. I have cancelled this card to apply for other DBS credit card."
5,"I have this card as a Student Live Fresh Card, i like the convenience in online shopping and visa pay with 0.3% cashback so is a additional saving for me which i feel beneficial for a student. "
2,The sign up for 5+5% with a 60 cashback cap was good. However they decided to cap each category at $20 which effectively drops the cashback to $40. Classic market share grab then reversal of promises. Very dishonest. I will be switching to BOC when the promotional terms expire. 
2,"The 5% cashback  for all online and contactless charges with minimum $600 spend is attractive until they start implementing the $20 cashback cap for online and $20 cashback cap for contactless payment this year. This new terms will probably be their demise. With the increasing popularity of online spending, this card is going in the exact opposite direction. Well, there is always new credit cards coming up and I will probably keep this in the drawer when the new terms kick in, "
4,"The application process takes about 1-2 weeks to receive your card. It's useful if you bought large items as it's cashback is attractive. However, if there is no promotion, it is harder to get the cahsbacks."
1,Rating is for new cardholder. Probably won't last long without another change or promo. (E.g. 5% extra rebate with xxx spent)
1,"Was amazing (7% cashback + 1.2mpd), then average (5% cashback), now useless (5% cashback capped at $20 per category).  As useless as Citi Cash Back (Dividend). Avoid like the plague.  "
3,"I chose to apply for this card a few months ago to complement my DBS Multiplier account as I shop online frequently.  The application process was very smooth since I already was a DBS customer. I had instant approval and recieved my card quite quickly.  The 5% cashback for online spending and Visa PayWave transactions was appealing to me. However, due to the $600 minimum spend for the 5% cashback which I do not consistently reach, I only used the card when I had any big spending planned. Otherwise, I would only spend a minimal amount on this card to qualify for higher interest on my Multiplier account. (DBS markets this card to young people and yet impose such a high min spend?? ü§£üòÇüò¢üò≠)  Especially with the new changes with the cashback caps, it makes it harder to maximise cashback. But since I am an existing cardholder, these changes do not affect me until next year; I will decide again then if I still want to keep this card.   Overall, this is a good card to use if you regularly spend online and use Visa Paywave. But do remember to watch out for changes in the t&c's and adjust your spending to maximise your cashback.  Tip: If you use ez-reload with this card, the convenience fee is waived. I don't think it is counted for min spending or qualifies for cashback unfortunately, but it's useful if you want to cut down the number of cards in your wallet/lazy to top up ezlink card. You can also link your card to your Savings Account and use as your ATM Card."
4,Got this card to hit my one transaction credit card spend for my DBS multiplier account. General base 5% rebate for all PayWave and Online Spending. Other than that theres not much rewards which is the downside. Generally fuss free and easy to use card for Pay Wave and Online Spending option.
1,"If you are an online shopper or able to pay for your daily lunch/dinner ( i don't as I have a hawker center nearby), this card is for you.  Card is not useful for small spenders. Only worth its sign up gift.   Verdict: Use 1 month for sign up promo, then thrash it aside."
5,"The main card I'm using right now. With the 10% cashback (first 6 months and 5% after that) on PayWave and Online Spending, this card should definitely be used whenever there is a PayWave option available. Also, link the card to all your online purchases including Grab!  This card works with your DBS Multiplier (1.85%) too!"
1,"I invested in 14 loans progressively since end 2016. The payments were on time in the beginning. But soon, late payments started and to date, I have 6 loans under late payment with 2 of the companies under bankruptcy proceedings. That's a 42% default rate!  I even have one loan which had delayed payment from the beginning. Pls do your due diligence before investing with Moolahsense and take their credit rating with a pinch of salt."
1,"I've invested in Capital Match, Funding Societies and MoolahSense for 2 years.   I'm too lazy to share the details but you should AVOID MOOLAHSENSE. SO DISSAPPOINTED WITH THEM."
2,"atleast 25% of the loans i have funded are either in payment delayed or stressed status for quite sometime now , there is no significant updates around the recovery and not sure if they will be defaulted soon !, pls exercise utmost caution investing through this portal , invest only minimum amount and dont be taken away by campaigns with high interest. "
1,Probably stuffed with analysts with just psle cert... ought to improve on how they do their due diligence  
3,"Been using since 2016  Pros: - Has auto investing feature - Company and loan details are very detailed - Low minimum required, $100 - Loans come in many flavours, such as callable, monthly equal installments, bullet etc  Cons: - Not as user friendly as other platforms. Might be daunting to new P2P investors. - Many types of loans and interest payments schedules, requires a learning curve for newbies. - Few cases of defaults, and the update frequency is not as regular"
1,Invested $3k into 3 diff companies via moolahsense. One of them defaulted after only a couple of payments. They have been chasing the the company for over a year but to no avail. Will not invest via this platform anymore. Pls beware.
1,"AVOID THIS AT ALL COST. If you want to be a millionaire using P2P platforms such as moolahsense, it's easy! Start with a billion dollars invested in them!"
1,"I invested in 45 loans, 31 current, 5 late, 7 past due, 2 doubtful. The numbers say it all about my experience with Moolahsense so far."
1,"I invested in nearly 50 loans in MoolahSense. Till date, nearly 25% of the loans have been classified as a loss or are late in payments. I think I would be fortunate to even get my principal back...forget about returns.  I am disappointed by the follow-up from Moolahsense and the high legal cost which has to be borne by investors. In one instance, the legal cost for action against defaulter of a 100k loan was 8k, with no guarantee of any recovery. What is surprising is that I had a few cases where loan issuers who had reported hundreds of thousands of dollars of yearly profits, started missing payments and ultimately defaulted within a few months.  I am not sure whether MoolahSense should have done more due-diligence to reduce this from happening.  Invest with extreme caution."
1,"I have invested in 35 loans since April 2017. (5 Successful repayment, 19 is currently paying, 1 defaulted (company went bankrupted), 10 delinquent) This means that there is a delinquency rate of 31.4% for my case presently. I may potentially see red.  Please exercise caution when investing through this platform. All the best!"
1,Default rates seem to be way understated. Invested in 60 loans since Sep 2017. Am only halfway through the loans but 11 are already at least 45 days past due. Looks like Moolahsense needs to brush up on the credit due diligence. Am pulling out as I am expecting to make losses at this rate.
1,"Been using since 2015,  The company, description of the loan's and company's financials are detailed. Out of the 11 I have invested, I have experienced 3 defaults. When it comes to defaults, the frequency of the updates is not regular and the resolution of it not very fast. Till now the 3 defaults, are still in default with no final outcome.  In my opinion, the current batches of loans seems to have a higher chance of default (2 of my defaults were from loans which were issued in 2017. Prior to that, I feel Moolahsense's ""credit writing"" of loans in 2015 and 2016 were much better. Perhaps MS has to do more QC of its P2P loans- less quantity of P2P loan but of higher quality?"
1,Full of shitty ass loans. I had 3 deals in default right now and the updates are extremely slow. The last update I received for one of the defaulted loans was from a month ago. Good thing I didn't put a lot of money on the platform. MoolahSense team needs to step up their due diligence process. I am starting to withdraw all of my money every time I get paid back. I wouldn't recommend this platform to any of the people I know. This is a nightmare!
1,"Thier debt recovery is horrible, when you email or open a ticket especially with regards to complaints against their recovery efforts they will not reply you. Please avoid, i have about 1.4k loss with them not recovered."
1,"I invested in 224 loans over the last 2 years with Moolahsense. I am making next to nothing (4% return over 2 years for such a risky investment is a terrible return).  Moolahsense's due diligence is extremely lacking. A good majority of loans in default, default upon the 1st or 2nd payment and the debtor's can't be found. Such issues clearly show that Moolahsense does not vet the debtors properly."
1,"1. I invested similar amounts in both Funding Societies (FS) and Moolahsense (MS) around early 2018, as an experiment.   2. To me, MS started out as having an edge over FS due to its more intuitive, user-friendly site, and more information on the loans available.  3. Since then, Moolahsense has been lagging behind. They reacted much later to the market offering lower loan quantums (e.g. minimum $500 per loan rather than $10 vs FS), they also were behind in implementing the automatic investments.  4. With automatic investments turned on, and with similar investment criteria (e.g. min. $50, up 3 month loan only, specific sectors only etc.), I personally experienced a default rate of MS loans 4-5 times that of FS. Something like 5 of every 10 in MS compared with 1-2 per 10 in FS.  5. Close to Default and Default handling procedures - I would say FS trumps MS big time. MS basically gave me the feeling that they won't do anything extra to help investors. FS has skin in the game, and to me they seem to go the distance to ensure the success of the loans.  6. Observed the CEOs of both companies at some fintech events. The FS guys seem a lot more genuine than the MS one. Note: this is my subjective opinion.  I could go on, but I think the above would perhaps would provide some perspective to help the community decide which platform to try out."
1,"I would strongly recommend avoiding this platform. I have been investing with Funding Societies, Capital Match and Moolahsense for an year. I chose the auto-allocation option on all 3. There has been zero losses on the other two, while Moolahsense gave me 28/48 losses! This goes to show that risk management is pretty much non-existent here."
1,Moolahsense is by a very large margin the worst possible P2P investment platform available. Stay away! Expect 20-30% losses.
1,"Total loans made 119, repaid 59, current 60, late 4, pass due 18, doubtful 10, loss 16 and close off 3. very ugly set of numbers, especially when compared with the other p2p platforms that i have also invested.....looking at possibly just recovering principal or making a small loss. other platforms yielding around 12% to 20++% for the same duration of 2.5 yrs"
2,"Took months for my application to be approved. It was my second application that got approved. Never tried using it thereafter as there were no ongoing loans, and the reviews online were not very positive."
1,"I won't recommend MoolahSense to anyone as its risk management, bad debt recovery and loan quality are far away below its peers.   Invested in 20 loans since Nov 2017. I have been withdrawing any available funds from MoolahSense since Oct 2018. I am worrying even not able to get all my principal back. The default rate of my investment in this platform will be terribly high given current loan status:  Paid 7 Current 2 Late 2 Past Due 5 Doubtful 1 Loss 3"
3,"Dated interface, lesser loans available, reporting/update really slow."
1,Applied in March. To start in May. Today‚Äôs July and I‚Äôm still stuck with SP. no notification from keppel. Called them but don‚Äôt know what went wrong. How is that even possible? 
1,"I had many problems with Keppel Electric.  @ during signing up, I was told by the sales person that either a dbs debit card or a credit is available for rebates of $20. Unfortunately it was not the case. Only the credit card which I didn‚Äôt have. In the end I didn‚Äôt get the $20 rebate   @my monthly bill is less than $40 which I have requested to offset the outstanding amount from U Save which sometimes is successful and sometimes not successful. I have to call Keppel to get it done.   I may consider to terminate the contracts early even if I have to pay penalty. "
1,"Useless service. The initial bill was cheap after that is expensive. Should have stayed with SP services. Asked for the paper bill, and they charge $2. Everything is money. 2nd time posting. 1st one was deleted by admin. "
1,"Terrible experience with Keppel electric, messy billing cycle (bill as & when Keppel feel like it), terrible charges (no logic, being charge for Exorbitant amount) horrible & rude customer service. Terrible billing department, totally no response from billing department for bill clarification (treat end user like idiot & we keep on pay & pay). If have choice, will swift immediately "
1,"before endorse on the contract, promise to give this and that voucher during the road show. end out push around and get nothing. been cheated. waiting for contract end and get out.   "
1,"I am not able to get my GIRO activated after three bills, this is my experience with Keppel Electric."
4,"When the open electricity market was launched, I deliberated and delayed for a while to scout for the best deals that were being offered. I eventually settled on Keppel Electric because they are affiliated to my company. I might have missed out on the ""best"" deal but I trust market forces to balance out the competition.  Registration was quick and easy to understand. I have not experienced any change or disruption since signing with Keppel Electric."
5,"I decided with Fixed 36 plan. I took the view that our regulated electricity tariff would ‚Äúhardly‚Äù go down. Did u pay lesser when oil and gas price crash in 2016? In October 2018, the rate was revised up to 0.2413 (before GST), 0.2582 (after GST). 0.1798 (after GST) presents 30.37% discount of current rate. Why not? My 2 cents view"
1,It would be good and better understanding if the monthly bill can be indicate the beginning meter reading and last meter reading 
1,"before changing to keppel, i only pay one SP bill. Now i become need to pay two bills in one month ??? one bill to SP for water and Gas, another is the electric bill to keppel. Why keppel is not combining the bill for us ?? why this was not communicated when signing up ?? "
5,"Applied online with online promo code, and SP effected switch two weeks later. Rates and terms were as indicated online. Had a question (""Do promo codes/incentives stack?""), which KE's customer service answered clearly when I called the hotline (""No they don't stack, sorry"").  Happy with service.  Thanks to Keppel Electric staff for their professionalism!  Cheers!  To folks signing up, would suggest to think along these lines when comparing vendors a) choose rates and lock-in period you want b) check contract terms online: Q1. any deposit needed? Q2. what are the incentives and whether these incentives stack? Q3. what is billing method?  (Some vendors Ohm/Best/Tuas bill thru SP if this is impt to you) Q4.  Does company absorb transmission line losses? c) if locking into fixed price contract, sign with a vendor that you trust to be still there when prices rise d) my experience has been that roadshow specials can only be, at best, one notch better than the best online deal.  Basic $$ Incentives (Rebates, Vouchers) are typically in S$40-$100 range across vendors.  At 20-30% savings off bills, the one off incentives are probably not as important as choosing the right vendor quickly.  PS: Most of my buddies signed with either Keppel Electric or Geneco after thinking it through, signing  3-year fixed price contract.  According to the nice call centre lady, the other popular package is the ~22% discount off tariff (tho none of my buds chose that).  There are other funky packages (e.g. night lower rates, Sunday off) which are interesting, but I don't think the majority of people will benefit from them.  i reckon that with market forces, these things square up so that most peeps will benefit most from the non-funky mainstream choices.  PSS: If it is important to you to have *some* element of clean/alternative energy, look at Sembcorp Power or Sunseap"
1,"Their customer service is rock bottom. Such terrible service.  Their email is so unclear and non specific.  Asked them to call back,  nobody calls back.   Regretted signing up.  I'll definitely terminate their service once the contract is up. "
1,Had to re apply and wait for another start date of service. They also never update me of anything. My online account doesn't show any start or end date.  Also I ask for help at their costumer service but said they cannot help me so I better send email instead. 
2,"Hard to leave a good review.  Called customer service for 2 times to update my e bill address , in the end, Still send e bills to wrong email address .   Feedback for user portal, only 1st address has button to download bill statement, the 2nd address has nothing . Pls enhance the site . "
1,You didn‚Äôt give me enjoy ONE-TIME $68 BILL REBATE  plus ONE-TIME $15 CARD REBATE & SAVE UP TO 30% OFF YOUR ELECTRICITY BILL üéØüéØ  once I switch to KEPPEL  ELECTRIC suffer my bill keep going up ?? üò°üò°  please look into it and refund me the money?? üôèüôè
2,"Bill seems to be more expensive after switching to Keppel. Had to contact them to verify. It was explained that they get the readings from SP group and the usage figure are estimated. Turns out it was overestimated and I received a rebate the next month.   Subsequently, they titled my August bill as September bill. Also, even though Giro was set up and payment had gone through for the August bill, it was reflected as unpaid and being rolled over to September bill.   Long story short, there were lots of hipcups and stress. Even though they could be fixed by calling the service hotline, had to waste quite a lot of time (it‚Äôs not easy to get through to a customer service agent, had to hold for pretty long). "
1,"1. Statement not generated timely . Need to follow up to get it generated and pay. 2. Average units coming in statement coming highest which was never the case with PUB. 3. Response of query resolution is 5 working days , shud be around 2-3 days."
1,"Terrible, just terrible.  Horrendous after service. Took over 2 months for my switch to take effect. In this two months period  there is no contact nor update. No paper invoices, if you want paper invoices you gotta pay extra dollars every month for it, which is not exactly friendly to the elderly who cannot use digital format to check their billings.  Call center helpline staff is clueless and cannot help you with your issues.  AVOID THIS COMPANY, SAVE YOURSELF. LOOK ELSEWHERE.  "
1,"The price did went down for the first 3 months, but suddenly shot up on the 4th month, and continue to stay higher than the initial period on subsequent months. I've been very careful with my electricity consumption and wonder why is it so??!! Tried calling their customer hotline but never once manage to get to speak to someone. No choice but to end up paying more since. Tried to visit their customer service counter but info on their website is not clear. Wonder how Keppel calculates my usage. Billing dates varies every month too, I just didn't receive the bill on a fixed date. Seem like unreliable service from this provider. Can't wait for contract to end and will switch back to SP to be safe. What a shame!"
1,"During the promotion, I was informed by the staff $25 plus $20 to be credited into my account.  It is now more than SIX MONTHS there is no credit of the said amount. "
1,"Up to today, Keppel still don‚Äôt have any mobile appl to help customer with Billings and usage tracking. Even some requests is taking so long and still on hard copy. Nowadays, we are talking about SMART nation, why still login from PC and web browser only? If SP can do it, I don‚Äôt see why such a big company like Keppel is so outdated."
1,"I regret signing up 3 years plan. I'm probably the minority who has lots of USave rebate that can cover both water and electrical bill monthly. When I'm with SP I don't need to pay a single cent from my pocket. But after I change to Keppel my USave can't be applied. After 3 to 4 months of emailing with cust care, and they telling me that I can use USave... I still end up paying cash.  I was told this month bill WILL BE deducted through USave, but  I just receive a sms telling me I have late payment. It just NEVER works!!!!!  It will be HORRIBLE if next month I received late payment charge for this bill because of their own problem. "
1,"Deduction can be erratic, I sometimes get deduction twice a month. Billing is also haphazard, and not in an exact date every month. Due to this, I find it difficult to reconcile what was liked & what had been deducted. This issue must be addressed & rectify immediately"
1,"Seems my bill is going higher and higher since signed up to the contract?   and never receive the promised voucher, be considerate if you like to sign the contract.  "
1,"I kind of regret signing up with Keppel, because after I've signed up I tried to contact the person who register for me but he didn't respond and not long after I've registered, there's lots more bonus for new sign ups, it s just not justify for those who signed up with you earlier, a total disappointment! "
2,"this was the replied from Keppel Electric on incident Reference No: 190628-000236. Totally not clearing my doubts & repeating the clarification.  Thank you for contacting Keppel Electric. We refer to your Incident Reference No: 190628-000236 We hope to clarify again, your account current outstanding amount is $25.

3,"I switch to Keppel Electric in Jan 2019. Switching over is hassle free.   1) Customer service is not responsive. Do not expect a call back even when they promise they will call back after they check with their backend on why i can't redeem the referral points.   2) The app is not user friendly. Kinda confusing. Bill can be hard to understand as well. I end up paying double sometimes as it indicate on the app that i have not made any payment.   3) The first few months when i switch over, the bill was very low. Guess they are giving some candy. 1st mth - $12+ 2nd mth - $20+ 3rd mth - $30+ 4th mth - $50+ 6th mth - $100+ 7th mth - $80+.. There were no new electronics product at home. No change in the usage. Not sure why there is such a great increase. -_-"""
5,"The conversion from SP services to Keppel is seamless. There‚Äôs totally no problem faced in the change of electricity provider, and yet, i can save so much. Great deal!"
4,Registered online because of the promotional plus points we can get. The transfer was fuss free and we can pay the bill from the Keppel electric portal via credit card which gave us another option.
2,electricity bills seems to keep increasing.  Thought changing to Keppel will help to save some money but Guess not.  
1,"I feel very shortchanged & Cheated, because after I signed the contract, Keppel offer ADDITIONAL ntuc voucher !!!! "
1,"Signed up in 1st Mar, suppose to confirm the switch by 8 Mar but still not gotten any reply from them. Call up customer service they said I did not provide SP account number to them and my application could not process Unhappy because they did not bother to text or email to ask for my SP account. Ask whether I could cancel the application but they said cannot and meanwhile just have to wait patiently for their reply."
1,"I have applied for Giro but after 2 months the bill does not reflect that even bank has notify me on my application. Called up customer service number but be it choose 1 for billing matter or 0 for operator, the line was cut off. Email to them just received incident number and there is no follow up. My bill shoot up every month and there is a portion of estimation cost. Unable to find out since NO RESPOND ON EMAIL AND PHONE CALL."
4,Competitive rates! No issue at all in terms of electricity provision. Am a convert. Will recommend to anyone considering
1,"My transfer from SP to Keppel wasn't a good one.   Even though the required docs like NRIC and recent SP bills were provided, it still took more than 1 month for the transfer to be done.    I was supposed to have a rebate by using certain credit card for the payment.  But as the transfer took so long, I can't remember which is the credit card to use and if I still qualify for any rebate.    KT  "
2,"I downloaded the GIRO application form online and mailed the form to Keppel Electric. Called in 6 weeks later, officer said they didn't receive the form. I asked for a new GIRO form with business envelope to ensure it didn't get lost again. However, I didn't receive the GIRO form after two weeks. I called in again and asked for a new GIRO form again, it has been days since I called, I still haven't receive anything from them. "
1,"I was promised by email ref: 190506-000305 dtd 8th May 2019 for $80 rebate but was not entered into account number 1356937002 in the Jun 2019 bill $25.87 dtd 11th Jul 2019 due on 25th Jul 2019. Credit = -$80 + $25.87 = -$54.13 should be the correct amount to be reflected in the account. The accounts dept should enter my promo of $80 rebate in the account immediately so that it should be reflected as -$54.13 credit instead of $25.87 debit. This should be done instead of waiting to send me a penalty in the next month bill and waive the 50c late payment charge which was due to keppel‚Äôs account problem and not due to my late payment. To solve all the bad reviews, the account dept is the one which need to be on the ball to update all the promised promo amount into all the customers account.  Do not give the excuse that need 10 working days to escalate to the accounts dept.  Learn from mobile operator M1 accounts dept, they will correct whatever account problem immediately instead of waiting for 10 working days which should be scrapped if you want to retain your customers and have very good reviews in return. "
2,We are quite satisfied with the charges after monitor for last few months. But out of sudden this Jun was shoot up to almost additional 70% and we really got no way to get it clarify as it‚Äôs very subjective and still pending response from Keppel Electric on that. Hope that they can explain to me on why there is an increase!
3,"Slow response from customer service. Would be better if they can proceed with their promise s earlier. For my case, my request for paper bill termination was not processed even after 4 months. Had to call 4 times before it was successfully processed."
5,"I open account on line during promotion period, the procedure is clear and simple to understand. when I called the hotline to clarify some details , the line get through immediately and I can speak to the customers service officer for my questions directly and without going round and round to get the right option 1, 2 , 3 ........... I strongly support the paperless e-billing to  save the earth, but I suggest for those account owner that is above 60 years old senior, the charges of $ 2 should be waved so that they can monitor their monthly bill with no extra charges."
3,"I wish the bills are much clearer. Although theres app for me to login, but the bill is not clear on how much electricity I used. Is it really based on the electricity meter outside of our house or charging us based on the average data?  I'm afraid that  the transaction cannot pass through by Giro and start charging us for not paying the bill on time. As the result, I have been paying via AXS machine. I really hope that Keppel will fix the problem or feedback or even improve from the pros and cons. "
3,"Actually, billing is not as promptly as SP. For example: I only get my May billing this month (July), which is really hard for me to keep track on my power consumption. This is a problem that Keppel must improve on.  As for Saving it is not significant.   I signed a FIXED36 plan, Hope to see more improvement soon. "
5,"Application was easy and done by road show sales personnel.  Customer service personnel was very helpful when I called to inquire on the cash back for recurring payment using UOB credit card.  However, the sales personnel at road show need to inform customer that we need to login to Keppel Electric website to activate account.  They got my email address wrongly and I did not get the notification from Keppel Electric  until I received SMS message saying my payment is overdue."
5,"I signed up online with Keppel during their initial launch for the new zone in Sengkang. I managed to get the online promo of $85 + $15 bill rebate which was one of the best value promo available during Jan.  The process of signing up via online was very straightforward. Only need to provide ur details, SP Account number, choose the date u want the account to be switch and your credit card details for recurring payment. Submit the application and wait for their email. Everything was seamless for me. No more hard copy bills as Keppel uses electronic bills, I am receiving the bills to my email every 1st week of the month.  So far no complaints from me yet as there's nothing I can complain. No error on bills or payment issue. Just hope I don't need to call their customer service for any issues. "
1,"My dad signed up with Keppel Electric back in November 2018 without much comparison as he didn't see much difference among the many retailers as long as he is paying a lower rate than SP's. While it's true that we're definitely paying a lower rate than the prevailing SP's, it has been quite an administrative nightmare.   (1) My dad was not informed of the paper bill charge and the sales agent not only omitted that there's a $2 paper bill fee, but also somehow filled in a bogus email under his account. Resulting in the confusing conversations within the family along the lines of ""did you throw the bill away?"", ""do you think the bill went missing in transit""? till my dad called in and got this mystery solved as the bills were obviously sent to the bogus email account .______. (I just hope it's actually not to a working email account, given there are quite a lot of sensitive info on the bill which shouldn't be directed to any Tom, Dick, or Harry since those are actually personally identifiable info.)  (2) Folks at the call-centre were always helpful over the phone, but not very good at following up. The paper bill issue only got resolved recently. Like my dad lamented, he probably wasted more time and effort trying to get and PAY his bills than the amount he saved. Didn't help that back in November, TLF fees weren't absorbed and it was also a fact that that particular sales agent conveniently left out.   (3) The online portal left much to be desired. I entered my dad's CC details hurriedly a couple of months back in an attempt to lessen all the bill woes of my silly dad but it somehow went into a black hole of data without any verification & confirmation from Keppel (not even an OTP) and it somehow finally got reflected as the payment mode on the bill 2 months later.   tl;dr: Bill savings from SP's rates is something you can't discount but choose your retailer wisely. A solid billing system, alongside long-term benefits (e.g. rewards/customer care standards) would be what I look for upon the renewal period as lower rates + one-time discount may not be worth the pain and inconvenience bad billing system brings you.  "
5,"I registered for Keppel Electric with M1 in June. Once my application was approved, the transfer process from SP to Keppel Electric was very smooth. I also enjoyed a one-time discount from Keppel Electric to offset my M1 bill and other freebies which were included in my package. As compared to other electricity providers, Keppel Electric's rate is very affordable. Keppel Electric customer service was very helpful whenever I needed help. I'm glad to be Keppel Electric's customer."
2,"For the electric plan, it a good idea to have fix rate for 2years and 3years plan.but this year 2019 latest promotion 16.71((3yrs plan) are cheaper than those earlier Bird who sign up last year 2019 16.80(3yrs plan).so I think Keppel electric should be loyal and should look into this matter to be fair to early bird who supported Keppel Electric in the early sign up plan to  attract more consumers and to be fair to all consumers. Early birds should get the better discount as compared to latecomers."
2,"I was told that they will have the GST deduction too when I enquire before signing up, but I don't see any at all. It only happen under SP & Town Council bills. It's difficult for me when their deduction is done a few days before payday."
1,"Bad experience with Keppel Electric (KE) 1. Sales promoter Zul promised to give me the groceries voucher did not fulfill his promise and 5 months after the change in service provider, he is still finding time to send me the vouchers. He has since resigned.  2. Sent an enquiry to Keppel who is supposed to response within 5 working days. After more than 100 days, there is no a single respond. 3. Applied for Giro payment using KE apps. Application appeared to be ok but after more than 2 months, there is still no sign of processing. A check with OCBC showed there is no application made. Why set up a Apps portal with noone manning and responding? Integrity of Sales promoter should be investigated. "
1,"Terrible experience. Started with Keppel in May-2018, regretted until today. Messy billing cycle, double billing me the same date every month and only recently changed after months of complaints. Their explanation is system error and no refund to me!?  Nothing cheaper than SP, I signed up with a fix-rate of S16.50/kwh for 24 mths, ended up my usage increased and total billing is more than SP with no change of living habit? Strange.  100% sure will kick Keppel off once contract over.  0 star rating not allowed, so die die must rate them 1 star at least, hahaha!!!"
1,Keppel wants their pool of customers to write good review but a chance only to win $50? They think customers are stupid and can be taken for a ride.   So many 1 Star here really said something about the empty promises made.  It is time that Keppel wake up and do something about what they have promised but never deliver.
5,"I'm happy with the perks from Keppel Electric, that I find most suitable for me, in comparison to the other retailers in the open electricity market. It allows auto-charge to my current primary credit card (being UOB One, and qualifying for UOB One rebates), and the upfront new joiner perk of $50 cashback was what attracted to me most. Though Keppel Electric may not be the exact lowest rate (I won't mentioned which other retailer I found with the lowest rate), the perks that I mentioned suited me better than the perks of all other retailers.  Specific thanks to the person from Keppel (Wayne Deng) who made my transition to Keppel, very smooth."
3,Hard to get through the phone line when I needed assistance. The monthly bill can have more details: 1) Indicate kwh consumed per month on each bar chart 2) asterisk to indicate that month's reading is estimated 3) State meter reading and date reading was taken. 
4,"It's been more than a year since I switched to Keppel Electric. I was one of the first few since I live in Jurong. At the point of time when I chose Keppel Electric, their fixed rates were the lowest among the electricity providers but a few months later after it opened to other parts of Singapore, other companies had lower rates. However, prices are rather constant so I have no complaints. Waiting to see if prices remain constant with the upcoming increase in electricity tariffs. Will consider to renew after the contract is over if prices remain competitive."
4,"It was the cheapest around when I signed up. But subsequently there are others that are cheaper. Unable to switch due to 24mth contract. Overall, still cheap and decent. Fuss free, bill came via email (there's a charge for paper statements). No disruptions when switched over.   Would be good if they have a recurrent billing arrangement via credit card."
3,Keppel electric's portal is very backdated. Also unable to change payment mode easily to giro. Application approval is fast 
5,"Good customer service, we havr loads of people in our household. The monthly bills were signifcantly lesser than sp group eith keppel 1 year fixed rate."
5,-Roadshow staff was really helpful & friendly  -More professional in their services compare to some of the other providers  -Recommend to those having a chance to switch over soon!  
5,Friendly staff at the roadshow makes the conversion convenient and easy to understand. Free NTUC linkpoints is a bonus too.  
4,"It was recommended by friends and family, and the fixed 24 months plan suits my need by keeping the rate stable. However the first few months of billing was late, and the bills did not show which are the estimated months (SP bills does show which months are estimated), causing confusion when there are adjustments billings in subsequent months. "
1,Do not take up contract will Keppel Electric.  I supposed to receive a $15 bill rebate for recurring card bill payment on end August but didn't materlise.   Call them 3 times.Their customer service officers promised to call back on the same day to update me the outcome but failed to do so.  I am still waiting for their response.
3,"Both my parents and myself use Keppel Electric for our electricity provider. The online platform's decent, and I like how it's user-friendly. Can't tell the difference between it and SP services honestly, as the switch was seamless and everything's working as before. We did have issues lately though. My parents' giro application was indicated as approved but we had a late bill recently. I logged in to pay, and my first try was indicated as failed, so I tried again. Turns out that both went through. My bank put a block on my card thinking it's fraud, and now I have to do a lot of admin to hopefully reverse one of the transactions (else I guess it'll just be reflected as a credit balance hopefully). But this hiccup is a waste of time for me. Worse still, I tried calling, and found that their customer service line only works during office hours (ie. weekdays). So buyers beware. You may not be able to get customer service quickly when you need it. "
1,"I am not very satisfied with the administrative work whereby I had make two complains regarding referral credit  that I had refer to, for delay payment, the latest 2nd referral were mistaken I redeemed which actually was the first referral , not the second one which still in suspense. Secondly the E-Statement was confusing owing to even the administration make mistakes to my Referral payment    "
1,My experience since switching to Keppel has been very very frustrating. Keppel needs to state very clearly the billing cycle as I am over billed for the past months. I do my own meter reading by sending a WhatsApp photo shot for electricity n water readings to sp services on a monthly basis. This has been the case over the years with no incidents or disputes.  2. My various correspondence for dispute resolution seems incomprehensible to the billing dept as their  reply simply ignores the issue.  I trust this subsidiary of Keppel Corporation can live up to the reputation of its parent.  Bottom line .... I will not recommend my family n friends to switch to Keppel.
1,Useless service will change services once my contract end. No paper bill their apps also suck already create an account keeping asking to create a account again. Useless apps
2,The app that kepple has its horrible its like a app doing it just for doing it. Not much of a function and always hang. The only attractive thing is that it is cheaper than most other provider that‚Äôs all
2,"Initially I signed up for keppel Electric based on the positive feedback from my friends. It been about 8 months since I ported over and the first few months, the experience was good and the price was kept at an acceptable level.  However recently these few months, the bill size started to increase every month. Even though I am on the fixed24 month plan and my usage pattern are the same, the bill continue to increase.  This makes me disappointed and the promise to customer was not as planned.  I may consider changing to another vendor after my current contract is up."
1,"Hi Keppel Electric,  I had wrote on your FB page, till today (15 Jul), there is no one calling me to explain. Below is my experience.  ------------------------------- I had applied for Keppel Electric in Mar 2019 and was confirmed on 10 Mar that my contract with Keppel Electric is now in place.Subsequently I was informed that the services will start on 15 Apr. However in early 02 May, I noted there is no transfer and log a case (Ref: 190502-000570). After 6 days on 08 May, I was informed that Keppel is currently investigating and have resubmitted the application.   From the same case on 02 May, another response (Ref: 190502-000571) was sent on 13 May (11 days from start) to inform me that they are checking with the team on the AMI installation status. Just hours before Keppel Electric called to inform that AMI installation need to be done first was supposed to get back the date of installation of AMI.  Then on 17 May (Ref: 190508-000433), Keppel Electric replied that my account is still waiting for the install the Smart Meter.  Finally the AMI meter was installed on 24 May and I immediate email Keppel Electric on the same day to inform and was acknowledged by Keppel Electric.   But again on 29 May, I received an email about unsuccessful meter installation and immediately contact Keppel Electric. On 12 Jun, Keppel Electric responsed (Ref: 190605-000113) that the service will commence on 04 Jun.  Again on 13 Jun, there is another email from Keppel Electric to state that you are unable to proceed with my application. My application will be cancelled on 17 Jun. However when I first receive the email from Keppel on 10 Mar, it was worded that it is not an application but a CONTRACT. However now, Keppel Electric when trying to unilateral ‚Äúcancel the contract‚Äù, decided to reword our contract as an application.  I had requested for the manager to call me by 16 Jun but till today, no one has.   Comment on your page more than a week ago but and you replied you will be investigating and reply. Till today also no news.  Then on your FB page, you mentioned someone contact me but again no. There isn't any customer service representative who reached out to me. When finally someone from Keppel Electric called but it is to asked me if the AMI meter is installed so that Keppel Electric could proceed with my application.   When I highlighted that I already informed Keppel Electric via email that the AMI was installed on 24 May. He responded that they are from different department. When I asked about if my service (in Keppel record) start from 04 Jun, after he checked, he replied yes which basically I had not confident in his answer.   I totally had not idea why Keppel Electric contact me to ask if AMI meter is install then to explain or inform me that the service has started.   I had requested some management from Keppel Electric call back and inform me your investigation result but Keppel Electric keep saying you  have been notified that a customer service representative has contacted me and will assist on my case, but in reality is NO. Only someone to anger me more asking question which I already replied.  Mot recent on 15 Jul, received an email from Keppel Electric that they are unable to reach me on the phone but I did not even receive any miss call for past 1 week.  As far as I am concern, there should be no charges of electricity from SpPower from 04 Jun, if there is, any excess amount from the contract, should be borne by Keppel Electrics.  I really wonder if Keppel Electric really serious about your business?"
2,"Barely after 3 months of switching over, their rates dropped and I was told that I have to pay the higher rate which I've signed in the contract, which is 36 months. And although the sales person was very helpful but i was only informed that the additional $10 discount was ""only while stocks last"" when i inquired. Rest of the discount vouchers were given as promised, can't remember the exact amount, should be around $40 to $50. Not really a good deal after all."
3,"Would prefer a paper bill, but Keppel charges each bill at $1.07. No much issues with the electrical supply."
2,I've no idea why it is so expensive for our bill. We are family (4 peoples)  on 3R HDB and the bill was about $200 per month
2,"When I signed up Fixed24 contract, the promotor told me that I will receive $20 rebate in my first bill, and another $20 if I use DBS card to pay.  So, I signed up and in the first month's bill, I indeed received the $20 off. I used my DBS card to pay, hoping to get another $20 off. In the following month bill, I was shocked to see that there was no discount of $20. I emailed to check with the Customer Service and learned that the other $20 off is only applicable to DBS Giro payment. I complained that the promotor did not explain this when signing the contract. The promotor is just trying to earn his commission!! :( no apologies and after action review from the customer service as well.   The change of electricity was smooth without any hiccups. However, I don't feel that there is much difference to the bill of SP. So I would most likely terminate and switch to other supplier or SP after end of contract.   Down: promotor not honest. Cusomter service not good.  Up: change was fast and smooth"
1,"Spell my husband name wrongly, informed but nothing done. The sales guy was even worse  when I said I didn't have credit card ignored me. Waiting for contract to end."
2,Took 3 months and various calls on the hotline and emails to get wrong billings fixed. Didn't enjoy the customer experience with the slow respinse
2,I‚Äôm STILL WAITING for my rebate of $60 because I paid my bill via GIRO using my Standchart credit card. Don‚Äôt make me ask twice!
3,I have subscribe Keppel electricity  nearly a year. I have submit my month  electricity though   Whatapp  via Singapore power. One set back the monthly  bill received via Keppel Electricity only reflect the previous month  meter reading record included the 3% loss of current . I have face difficulty to keep track the record.
1,"Terrible customer service...over-promise under-deliver. One bad experience after another. 1) Needed to terminate my account due to change of address. Customer service promised to follow up and return my call but never did. Gave me wrong info regarding my termination also. 2) Asked SP to terminate my water service and the customer service say electricity will also be terminated as well. To my horror, it wasn't and I continued to be billed for almost 1 week. 3) Called to dispute. Again no follow up. 4) Few months later they issued a letter of demand for payment despite the invoice dispute. And guess what? When I replied to that email with my explanation, NO REPLY AGAIN!!  Worst experience I had...even worse than Singtel which is notorious for bad service. Avoid at all costs!  "
3,"Hi To All ,  I saved some money for switching to Keppel Electric  However, previously I paid my SP bill through my Credit card but till now I need to pay my Keppel Electric bill through AXS machine Which I find very troublesome I asked for help to add my Keppel Electric to my credit card  But till now Keppel Electric is still unable to help me do that Hope someone can help me  Thanks with Regards Steve Wong"
4,"I remembered the first time I signed up with keppel electric, their partnership with M1 really offers me huge discounts on my m1 bills. I even receive vouchers too. Ever since I switched to keppel electric, there's no issue at all. Compared to my previous SP bills, there was indeed a huge difference. Therefore, I'm glad that I had chosen keppel electric as my provider."
1,Really a waste of time. Cannot get through the hotline after ringing for 30 minutes. No response from email. Never trust these sales promoters. Zero Customer service.
3,The website managing the user accounts is not intuitive and user friendly. There are bugs within the website pages that have not been resolved for months.
3,"Hi,  I had some issues initially after I had switched over. However the customer service was swift in the response.   Currently no issue so far. Just that I still have my concerns over the meter readings submitted monthly. Not sure if the readings are taken into account every month accurately.   Thank you. "
3,But it seems that their  billing is messy and not transparent and also their lousy customer service from facebook. Is that true?  https://www.facebook.com/Keppel-Electric-135765747091632/
4,Nice service. Good option to switch to Keppel Electic. Saving some money on electricity bills. I would recommend Keppel for switch.
5,Strong and reputable electricity provider that provides competitive rates in the market. Highly reliable.
4,Good and reliable!  Strongly recommend. Keppel electric one of the biggest player in the OEM!!!  Competitive rates for 2 years!!!!!! 
5,very good and very cheap Save more than 30% against regulated tariff of 25.92 cents per kWh. No hidden charges or monthly administration fees!
4,"One of the most affordable plan, give our slot generous offer and the company itself is public listed one, so the is comparatively good and cheap "
5,Not bad good pricing easy to claim good customer service over all good experience will recommend friends
4,"Good rate for the electricity charge and one of the most reputable OEM company out there, strongly recommended! "
4,Good and reliable!  Strongly recommend. Keppel electric one of the biggest player in the OEM!!!  Very goooood
5,Good and reliable!  Strongly recommend. Keppel electric one of the biggest player in the OEM!!!  Competitive rates for 2 years!!!!!! 
1,Why is there no ‚ÄúForget Password‚Äù when I want to log in ? All other Log in Websites have it. Please make your website log in user friendly. When I receive your monthly email bill it is normal I want to open to check the amount to pay.
5,"I went down to Parkway parade to the roadshow to check out the provider, as there is prmotion and rebate. Attractive rebates, and voucher. Sat down with their promoter, to understand more and they had me and my husband switched. Prices are great so we took fixed 36months, turns out after we switched, the regular price rose and we were lucky that we took the fixed rate so that we could lock the price for 36months. Great sign up, and i have since switched for 3 months now, everything seems good! "
5,"Glad that I made the switch as it not only saves my monthly electricity bill but it‚Äôs also convenient and switch over was seamless, tks"
1,"under keppel electric, my bill is 480. a 40 years i have been paying electric bill since PUB and then SINGAPORE POWER, never this much before, it a SHOCKING!!. I demand an explanation!! "
4,"Transition to Keppel is smooth, but there is a problem with the way charges are calculated with SP group and I think I have been double charged."
1,Watch out for the dishonest practice of this company - signed up for a promotion with SGD68 + SGD15 rebate. Received nothing and customer service is shamefully rude.
4,"Have been using based on the rate difference between SP and Keppel  the saving is significant,   However the recurring payment cash back was not clear whether it was for one month or recurring would have to be clear and is not automatic even though I was taken the details of card by the road show agent can consider making it automatic or Keppel can reach out rather than the customer reaching out and arranging."
5,It has been a great and very good experience with Keppel Electric. There is no disruption or hiccups whatsoever. I am able to have the peace of mind as a consumer. 
5,"Switch from SP to keppel, my saving on electricity is so much that i pay lesser by 2 times!! change now!"
3,"Switched to Keppel Electric does saves me some money, however if Keppel could inform me via message to pay the bills will definitely more convenient and effective."
5,"When we apply the application at the roadshow in Expo, It was fast , it took less than 15mins to complete the application.    Actually it was my sister-in-law who have convert from SP to Keppel and recommend it to us.  We have matched against other vendor and find that Keppel Electric have the more reasonable price."
5,Very  competitive in terms of price plan and serviceüëç. It help me save a lot  for my monthly electricity bill. Thanks!üëç
4,So far so good. Got our S$80 credit rebate as promised during the roadshow. transition from SP is smooth.
5,Changing over to Keppel was very simple and no hidden costs were incurred. From practical point of view absolute no changes were seen other than the monthly bill cost coming down. With the oil price escalation its good to have the fixed price rates for a known period of time. Highly recommends Keppel‚Äôs power supply to all.
3,"In your promotional literature, it is indicated explicitly that there is a $ 15.00 one time card rebate. The $ 68.00 has already been credited to my account. What happen to this $ 15.00 card rebate. Do you honour your words in your promotion?"
1,"Applied Keppel Electric about a year. Before switching over from SP services, the kWh consumption back than used to be 300+ to 400+ kWh per month. After both my brothers move out from the house. Instead of expecting lower kWh consumption, it increase to 400~500 kWh per month.   In fact applicances and usage behavior for the remaining family members in the house remain the same. I can‚Äôt explained why kWh is higher now with 2 lesser peoples.   Considering government had raise the cost of PUB and Electricity. Our monthly bill work out to be higher then before we switch over. I don‚Äôt see the saving? How do i know if the electricity consumption is accurate?  Though i thought it should!   Im quite doubtful! I don mind to continue with Keppel if someone from the company can address the mysteries!   Otherwise will go back to SP services, to find out if the electricity consumption is really higher?  "
1,"Account number:8418646903  The service rendered was really bad. Firstly, the app reflected the wrong contract details. I sent an email but there were no response. Subsequently, the issue is rectified but there were no follow up email to inform the customer.   I transferred the plan since 22 May 2019. However, I did not receive any bills. I tried emailing to keppel electric and again, there were no response after more than a month. Subsequently, I called your customer service hotline to enquire and was greeted by a rude customer service officer. In addition, he was breathing so loudly into the headset that makes the entire conversation unpleasant.   If keppel would like to retain your customer after the contract, I would highly suggest that you improve your customer service. "
4,"Mobile app needs to be more user-friendly, otherwise service and price are great. Please keep prices competitive."
5,The staff at the roadshow was helpful. He explained clearly & assisted me in the sign up. It was a smooth transition to Keppel electric from SP Services. 
5,Enquiries are attended to in a nick of time. Very informative and easily understood to most of my queries. Couldn't ask for more. I will not hesitate to recommend Keppel Electric to users who are looking to switch service providers. Looking forward to your Best Service As Always! 
3,"I am having problem migrating from NRIC log in. So far 2 attempts have been made unsuccessfully after guided by your staff through email, even attaching screenshots. Was asked to try again, albeit unsuccessfully, attaching screenshot as requested. Then till today no reply!  This is totally unacceptable! account:567422747568"
2,Terrible after sale service. Response is tardy. Signing up is easy or course but everything else after was difficult. 
1,"My experience is bad. I submitted an application on Sunday for the switch to start next week (10 days later)but when I called to cancel my application on Tuesday  (two days after my application ), I was told that the application has gone through and cannot be cancelled . I ask how come so fast and didnt revert to me for confirmation, I was then told it was a ‚Äòsigned up‚Äô, and was explained that this means I have agreed to it and does not require confirmation. I was then told that if I want to cancel despite the service not having started, I have to pay an early cancellation fee of $800 to $1000 for the two year contract that has not yet started .  I was told that the only way to waive the cancellation fee was to ask someone to take over the two year contract with Keppel. I felt disappointed in my experience and unhappy that I am now forced to proceed with the contract starting next week.  There is no cooling off period with all the sales campaign and promotion! Lesson learnt for me and I will remember this experience for next two years! What a sad way to start with Keppel! üòü."
4,I am happy with the portal. Is detail and helpful 24/7. I recommend you to use it too. I also strongly support Keppel to give out cash voucher or shopping vouchers to encourage more sign ups. 
5,"While being approach by the promotors at the roadshow, he is very nice and patience on explaining the benefit and disadvantages for me to change the electricity provider. Due to some issues I wouldn't be able to apply on the spot and he is patiently following up with me and not being pushy for the sales too!"
5,Effortless registration and the team that handled my account was very efficient.  Communication was clear and requirements concise.  üëç
5,Easy to subscribe. Link it with my M1 and got a $60 rebate off my July M1 bill. Hoping for more rebates from Keppel Electric. :)
4,"Smooth application process and transition considering that previous SP account was under my mother's name. Positive ratings for web interface as well, all relevant information at one glance."
5,"Simple application process, friendly n helpful customer service and most of all, it really saves money! "
1,"i was told switching  from SP to Keppel will save me 30% in my electricity bill. However, My monthly bill is increasing instead of saving. More ironically, the bill is even higher when my family was oversea for a couple of weeks. Why is it so? Can Keppel explain it ?"
3,"It‚Äôs a bit messy initally set up the customer portal n wait for the bill to be billed after few mths, subsequently it goes smoothly. These few mths increase for consumption trend that made up worry whether is it going this way as compared to SP billing after 6mths"
2,"I have very bad experience with Keppel Electric. The customer service staffs are very unhelpful. The Sales staff has lied to me on the cash back rebate to my UOB card which after more than 7 months, there was no sign  of rebate. It was until my sister has stepped in to help, Keppel Electric has finally agreed to give me back the $20 cash back rebate. I have yet to see the ‚Äúreal‚Äù cash rebate so my review here is below average,"
4,"I must say that my experience with Keppel Electric has been Super unpleasant since the day I signed by for 36 months plan due to the lack of communication between the sales personnel at site and the office staffs. My u-save rebate account was not activated for my Keppel Electric Account and it was a tough struggle to communicate it across to the customer service, it was finally resolved today. Given that Keppel Electric has improved its service to me despite after more than 6 months of unhappiness, I should give a reasonably good review for Keppel Electric. I cannot give 5 stars, sorry, given the troubles that I have went through. But I am happy to give you 4 stars. Keep up with the recent good efforts in maintaining the customer relationship! "
4,Was quick with the activation.. Giro payments was prompt and accurate.. Just need to improve on the hotline service. Should increase the phone operators as it takes too long and too many times before the operator gets connected to the call.. Other than that.. Everything is normal. My bill did decrease.. Which is good.. 
4,It was a switch that I never regret. Many people are still worrying if there are any disadvantage after the switch. It should not happen i believe.
5,The most value for money electric company in singapore!! Customer service is efficient and fast too! The only electric company i will recommend to friends and families to switch to . 
4,Fast process ie acknowledgement and transfer. Clear statement of account and ease of payment. value for money 
5,"Reason why I chose Keppel electicity instead of others is because their promotion is attractive! Secondly, their knowledgeable staffs handle your queries more professionalism with patience as well. Lastly, the rate given is definitely much affordable than its competitors !"
4,Your customer service and staff at roadshow is great explain the products clearly. A lot i dont understand they patiently explain. Kerp it up.
4,"I love using keppel electric because of it's great deals especially if you are M1 customer. You could enjoy bigger discounts and perks. Secondly, their agent was friendly, they would listen and answer your question patiently. No attitude or heck-care. Therefore, i strongly recommended this electricity provider."
5,The best plan so far... no upfront admin charge and we all know that we are helpless when the tariffs increases. Highly recommended. 
5,"Very smooth switch to Keppel, and value for money  ,also good service, the road show clearly explained, what that offer "
4,Start sign up to keppel on May19 & received the bill on Jun19. The price charge from keppel are quite reasonable & cheaper than SP. It's not regret to sign up with keppel cos it's really save my Electric cost for almost 30% compare with SP. Good deal!
5,"The process of change to keppel is smooth and no problem with our house electricity!! In fact, we save cost as it is much cheaper than what we usually pay"
5,"A straight forward application process, Keppel sales representative has explained everything clearly to me.  The switch over was smooth, everything run as usual.  "
4,Switched smoothly and do save some money.  Would be better if payment can be made by OCBC internet banking.
5,My dad switched to Keppel in April and I switched in June.  So far the experience has been great! The online application process is straightforward. 
5,"I was approached by Jason near Ng Teng Fong Hospital in May. He was clear and patience in his explanation and I decided to keep him in mind. Signed up through him though Keppel rate was higher then another provider in late June. Overall experience was smooth, no hassle. Satisfied with the service."
5,After I switch to Keppel Electric I really save . Sometime I forget to pay my billl and they email to me on the next day without any extra charges. 
5,Fast hassle free experience. Smooth and easy transfer by friendly and professional staff. Keppel Electric's benefits are impressive!
5,"Keppel Electric provides not only the competitive price rate with flexible choices of packages, but also a user-friendly website for end users to manage the account and monthly payment of bill. "
4,"Changing to Keppel Electric was a smooth transition though at first it took us some time to get use to E-statements.  Keppel do have paper bills but they charge $2 for each bill which it's quite costly, having said that my electricity costs is not a lot every month, so even with the discounts on I don't save much and yet I still have to pay $2 every month. Would be good if Keppel can reduce this $2 to $1, some retailers even waive this printing cost if payment is made via giro or credit card giro. "
3,"The reading were very high since I changed suppler, the bill was always late in comparison with SP water bill. SP bill always come within the month. This month I received 2 bills , 1 on 1st Jul for May reading another was on yesterday 16/7 for Jun.  I find all these very confusing! By the way, no regret as it is still cheaper!  I think Keppel is doing good business, they shall improve in future."
5,"Easy to apply and sign up, seamless transfer from Singapore Power. Saves me money and a  convenient service"
4,I have just received June's bill. Why is the period for 1st to 16th June only?  Maybe you can consider adding the national average for comparisons. 
5,it is very convenient. i pay by Giro and get my bill through my email. no need to worry about anything.
4,"Switching to Keppelelectric was quite easy through one of their customer officers, who helped me through WhatsApp. When account was set up, I could access their portal quickly to set up method of payment and to check my bill.  It was also very clearly explained to me by their customer support when I couldn‚Äôt understand the bill.  So far so good.  Keep it up!"
5,I using DOT3 plan as I want the flexibility to switch my plan. So far very pleased with switch to keppel electric. No interruption with my service experience and enjoyed better savings after the switch. 
5,Clarification on status of recurring payment for my bills was fast. Customer service response was clear so I do not have worry about late payment and penalties.
4,"Sign up during Roadshow in March, so far so good with Keppel.  Every month, I received the e-bill through e-mail."
5,I‚Äôm a customer since nov 2018 with Fixed36 plan. I‚Äôm satisfied with the plan and will continue this plan after my contact end! 
3,"Had switched to Keppel last Dec'19. Observe some saving on my electric bill. The monthly bill is coming late. For the bill period 17/05/2019 to 17/06/2019, the bill date is 17/07/2019 and that is ONE MONTH LATE. "
5,Very Transparent Electronic Bill. No hidden cost and save paper (Indirectly save the earth). A few plans to choose to cater on individual need. 
5,"Have been on this plan for a few months now, and I am definitely saving more using a Fixed rate! Definitely recommending this to my family and friends! "
5,Since switching to Keppel Electric few months now I do not feel any different than using PS previously. There is no hassle for me except the only thing is to apply and sign on and everything else just fall in place.      I did see some saving in my bill even though I am not a heavy user     I will definitely recommend Keppel to my friends as I find It reliable and cost savingüòÄ 
5,"The fixed 24  with fixed rate  is better on the long run , hence I do Not bother is the electricity tariff is up or down . The monthly statement is also easy to  read & understand ? hence I could known which area I should be looking into to reduce my wastage ."
4,So far so good. No disruption since changing to Keppel.  Received my 1st. bill. Payment by auto-debit through credit card.  Will Keppel notify payment has been effected? Do not like to be penalised not knowing if payment not effected prior to due date.
4,I find the entire experience of switching to keppel electric very seamless and also the monthly bill through email easy to access. I have since recommended Keppel electric to some friends. I hope that Keppel will introduce better rates for loyal customers when they continue their contract beyond 2 years
5,"hi. it aly 2 mth since i use them . so far i see the difference in it. has to say i save some money. and it mail my bill in email. it green , save the tree."
5,"My friend recommended me to switch to Kepple after my area Boon Keng is open. I was shocked to see my first bill, I have a huge savings of $60.00."
4,The switch from SP to Keppel Electric was almost seamless without any fuss at all. I am happy using Keppel and I trust our home grown Company as a first class electricity supplier. Thank you. From Consumer since Feb 2019
5,Sign up was fast and efficient. Refund of $65 was with SP bill. I didnt have the $50 rebate because I did not sign up for giro payment and pay 1st bill with certain credit card etc. 1st bill of via email was convenient. Overall experience is good thus far.
4,Keppel‚Äôs pricing is competitive with good customer service. However the billing is way too slow. It should speed up so customers are able to monitor their usage and help to conserve energy efficiently. It would also be helpful in this respect if the actual meter reading is reflected on the bill whenever it is read.
4,So far everything is quite good and can pay at the AXS machine. However the account number must be visible to customer otherwise we will have to search all over the lace for this number when paying up at the machine.
5,"Clear billing, prompt response to queries. Good promotion to join. Though separate billing but ebilling is a breeze"
4,Billing is good.  Giro works well.Getting in touch with customer service phone operative is easy.     I wish I could send monthly  meter reading to a website.Taking  Photo of the meter and sending by whats app is cumbersome.
5,"I'm happy after switching over with better rate in my bill. But, will be good to make my bill details more visual on the email with pie chart shown. Excellent team from Keppel Electric, Good Job. Christofer Kwang chriskwang2005@gmail.com "
5,Fixed rate which is Value for money . 36 months plan will be excellent.   Customer service are excellent.    Feedbacks or questions revert back  earlier than expected.    Thanks 
4,"It's difficult to get to talk to someone on your Helpline.  I tried before and then left a message.  When your rep called me a couple of times, I was unfortunately busy and missed the calls.  So I never got to speak to him.  Today I called to find out about why my first payment is not done through giro, as I had given instructions when I applied, but again, could not speak to anyone.  I've left a message, and hopefully can get this matter sorted out.  "
5,"I applied online for a fixed rate for 24 months. The transition process went smoothly, without any disruption of power.  I was given a promotional rebate on my first bill, as promised. The customer service on the hotline was prompt in answering my call and was helpful. Reply was also prompt for my enquiry via email. Generally, the bill was lower than SP. I would greatly recommend Keppel Electric to others as an electricity supplier. "
5,Switch to Keppel Electric and had so issues with the billing and switching our from SP. I received an sms informing me about my bill and the access to my Keppel account was straight forward to view my bill. Setting up of the giro onto my credit card was also done from my account.
5,"After switching to Keppel Electric, our electric bill had improved with the same amount of power used for the past 3 months. It is highly encourage to convert to Keppel Electric from today. üëç"
5,Electricity price is greatly reduced due to Keppel Electric. The app is also very user friendly to check for statement and to make payment. Thank you Keppel!  Steven
5,Transition from SP services to Keppel was super smooth. Absolutely no hiccups in my electricity service so far. Happy!
4,"Due to technical issues at SP end, i had to re-apply 4 times but each time KE was very helpful and patient. "
5,Signed up during a road show. Sales personnel patiently answered all my enquries and shared details on the process including the possible long wait needed for 1st bill. But thereafter all is good. It will be nice to have some notifications on Giro approval but calling to customer service clears that up and luckily waiting time is not too long.  The Keppel portal UI can be improved with more details and will be great if a app can be developed with similar details provided in it. All in all this is recommended.
5,"Keppel Electric, thank you for making my life gets brighter. The bill I received is lower than before and I can easily make payment by many metods. I feels very satisfied signing up with Keppel and I had also reccommended some of my friends and relatives to sign up with Keppel Electric.Hope they will be as satisfied as me."
5,"I applied through M1 who has a partnership with Keppel Electric. Application was smooth, terms & conditions clearly displayed. One word of cautuon: Do take note of the 3-year Fixed: read terms very carefully and don't plunge into signing this one based on the upfront lesser amount."
5,Keppel Electric portal is easy to use and issuance of bill is timely. Keppel Electric is reliable and bill payment method is easy and convenient too. 
5,"So far it has been a pleasant experience for me from application, processing to payment of my first bill. It has many options of payment too. They should also do the water and gas to complete the package experience. Thanks and Bracvo!"
5,I‚Äôve been using Keppel over a year now and found everything fine. Had a few initial setup questions which they answered and some account queries along the way which were also taken care of. Recently renewed as everything smooth and no complaints.
4,"No efforts needed to apply. Seamless transition fm Sin Power to Keppel Electricity. 30% saving fm previous Sin Power bill. Easy to understand Monthly consumption & Billing statement. To improve further, suggest to add Meter Reading in Monthly consumption statement. "

The change over from SP was smooth and the rate I was getting was one of the lowest in town. Not regretting my decision. Will be good if they can show meter reading for each month though. "
5,Application was a breeze. Switch over was seamless. Bill was considered competitive with other companies offering the same plan. 
5,"My family switched to Keppel Electric when the open electric market opened last year.    Before switching, we ran through the last three years‚Äô national tariffs and my home‚Äôs consumption, to plot expected future costs.  After comparing the retailers, Keppel Electric came up the lowest price for the plan that we were looking at: 2-year floating.  Before making our final decision, we called their customer service to clarify some queries.  It has been smooth since then.  Monthly bills have dropped by an average of 20%.  Recently, Keppel Electric provided us referral credits to refer and provide our friends with rebates to sign up.  At least three have done so.  As the open electricity market has opened for around half a year, promotions across retailers may have changed, do compare what they offer currently.  In addition, good to check with your telco and bank for any tie-ups with the retailer you plan to switch to, to get more rebates."
5,Good service and value for money as they offer a very competitive pricing plan.  I am a happy customer.

On the backend, things that can improve on... The apps, make it more user friendly, with touch id feature to make logging in user friendly.  On the customer service hotline, the operator need to improve on its product knowledge, as well as have more access to consumer information, because there is information sent to keppel customer service e-mail, however, they are unable to access the information and it is hard to explain things when they are not able to see the information, to summarize, to make the enquires, with case id, tag along to consumer  nric when given, so that everything can show up in the profile in their database."
5,seamless transition from SP. however still hope Paper bill can be sent to those above 50 years old as email might seems too troublesome for them. 
5,"Value for money, very easy customer service. Very clear to use app. But there's only one part I think you guys can look into. Transferring service to another unit. If a person moves and still wants to use the service, I think there should not be a early termination fees. (Unless the customer want to terminate the service for good) Maybe there could be a service charge (because of some back end work) Please look into it. Thank you. But you guys are doing a great job so far. Keep it up. "
5,It is cheap and better offered with referral bonus too. But need to consider old parents making payment with paper and credit card. Do consider an option for them.

5,"My family & I were unsure initially as we did not know anyone else who had opted for buying Electricity from any retailer in an Open Electricity Market (OEM). After some research, we opted for Keppel Electric and today we are completely convinced of our choice. The transition from SP Services to Keppel Electric was smooth. We also shifted residence one month after opting for Keppel Electric. They again managed the transition well and did not charge us any fee for the change of residence.  Kudos to the Keppel Electric team!!"

I hope that you can get the trust of customers and the business is booming.  I hope that kepple will not let us down, and hope that you are the first in rehearsal in Singapore, no one can win with your company.  Towards all parts of the country.  ."
4,"Overall experience is great. Only problem was they billed me wrongly. Suppose to rebate $40 instead they charged me $40. Had resolved anyway. I would suggest to have better support from customer service. No one pick up my call after several attempts and I gave up, email better "

I‚Äôm pleased with my decision and thanks to Keppel Electric for offering such a competitive and cost cutting package to me.   Strongly recommended to other potential users.   Jas Tan "

5,I have no regrets to change to Keppel Electric. I pay much lesser than before. I will continue the contract after the 2 years plan. Thanks Keppel Electric.
4,Service level still ok. Not too bad. Pricing is reasonable.  Area of improvement : billing process can be improved further such as billing customer on time.

5,A real value for money deal (17.68cents) especially for those who are app savvy and prefer to check usage/pay online. The Keppel app is pretty intuitive to use. No comments on their customer support since no problem so far (4 mths of usage). Sign up bonus is generous also (80+15). Went for the 3-year fixed plan and do see my electricity bills come down at least 20dollars a month. SP Power has really been sucking our blood all these years.
5,"Very satisfied to the switch as it truly save the bill. üëçüèª For improvement, hope Keppel can provide the information (the chart) as SP service bill."
4,It will be helpful if the monthly billing date or cycle is clearly stated so we can do our monthly bill payment planning.
5,seamless switch for me and enjoyed good sign-up promos. managed to pair it with the uob recurring bill payment for even more rebates.
5,"It was very swift transaction. We are at the mall and when they approach us and explain,everything is clear. The processing was very fast and even got NTUC voucher as gift. And now, i can say that it‚Äôs all worth it as it is really cheaper."
5,it is easy to use and user friendly. definitely going to recommend this to my friends and family. helped me saved at least 30% of the electrical bills

5,Signing up keppel was a breeze. Sales representative is knowledgeable able to assist in my enquiry. Follow up was good after I have sign up. Thumbs up to the sales team
4,"Electricity rate is competitive, much better than Sing Power.  Signing up w Keppel rep via Whatsapps is convenient.  The Keppel portal is easy to use.  But, the indication in the Portal about Recurrent Payment by credit card is a little confusing. This led me to pay the first month by a one time 'pay now' by credit card, n was wondering why the recurrent standing credit card arrangement did not kick in as arranged."
5,"I didn't feel the slightest inconvenience since I signed up with Keppel Electric in November, 2018. The change was seamless and I managed to pay 25% less for my electricity every month as a result of the lower tariff. The e-bill is also pretty easy to read. I'm glad I made the right decision. "
3,"Number of electricity provider but have decided to use Keppel as they have been quite a presence in the singapore market. After sales support and bill viewing is pretty bad in the beginning but somehow felt it is getting better... not the best yet but if the improvement continues... I'm pretty confident Keppel Electric would be the biggest player. As for now, please keep up with the current good work and dont disappoint. "
4,The sales person (Tracy Tan) was very patient in explaining the promo and which plan would benefited my situation best. Also she helped in following up with the tech team when i initially encountered registration online. Since then i didn't encounter any further issues.
4,"Electric supply is reliable, there were no disturbances when converting over. Customer service generally replies within 2 working days with the answers that i was looking for. Overall good experience with keppel :)"

4,"Using the off peak and peak. So far so good. Is confirmed cheaper than spgroup. For normal household,just take fixed rate package. For young couples, off peak should works better. The only downside is that you need to pay matter for off peak package."
5,"We switched to Keppel Electrics since March 2019, which  supply reasonale power to us. the results shows with A lot saving, we are feel much happy. hope more family do switched right now. it is saving at least 30%, thumb up."

5,Choose the fixed plan. Easy payment for bills. Cheaper and value for money plan. Recommened to those who havent sign up
5,"Since they are giving great discount compare to SP group and electricity supply are still the same, why not signing up. Every saving count....."
5,So far the service provided by Keppel is good with all the explanations n brochure n email. Besides giving a good discount on electricity cost.
5,"Value for money as compared to SP. No difference in supplying electric, no disruption. The more i use, the more i pay. Im glad that i tied down 3 yrs fix price contract. If govt decide to increase electric rate by 1000% also i dont care. I pay same price. Only after 3 yrs, then maybe i will consider sleeping under the bridge. "
5,Easy and hassle free transition. Good offer given for the conversion. So far experience was good and monthly report provided was timely. 
5,Signed up online which is fuss free during the promo period which gave us 85 dollar rebate. It eventually given us almost 1.5months free worth of usage of electricity. Easy to monitor and manage
4,I would say the switch over is easy and hassle free. The assistant also helpful and do close follow up. Happy with the change üëå
5,I got Fixed24 and have some savings. Change of provider is seamless. Bills are online via email which is eco friendly. Payment via cc which is worry free. Good for me.

5,"Hassle free switching from SP, received monthly statement promptly as well. Detailed breakdown of the consumption üëçüèº "
4,Have been using it An out 6 months. Everything is okay but it's be good if the bill can reflect the meter reading instead of only showing the kWh.
5,I chose the fixed24 plan because it is easy to understand and no frills attached. I signed online to enjoy the maximum rebate available in May 2019. Experience so far is excellent including the quick and responsive customer support! Do sign on if you haven't as Keppel Electric is trust worthy and you can rest your mind once you sign on.
5,It would be good that the customer service can reply query within 24hrs rather than waiting for 5-6 days later.. 
5,Keppel Electric is the name that is trusted and it is sensitive to its customers. No regrets so far. 
5,I was not the pioneer in switching to retail supplier of electricity but I finally made the switch when approach by one of my fellow Singaporean who worked and were paid on commission for closing a deal. I could have benefitted more by doing a internet switch but I chose to accept the switch through him. I hope to see similar features in KE App as those in SP App because I got used to the way I report my usage and relevant information are made available to consumers. I also noticed that the bill is usually a month late and payment records are not instantaneously displayed even though payment is made. 
4,"I have signed up three years and has yet to receive my first bill. Hopes it is a good switch. Thus far, the process and reply were prompt."
4,so far so good. signed up online due to the free rebate. registration is simple and easy. all is good.
5,"No complains so far. Happy with the email alerts with statement attached. Just something as an add-on, if it's possible to show the electricity consumption trend in a average day. "
4," I signed up Keppel Electric as my electrical supply provider on 12 th May 2019 half suspicious of the promised 30% savings to my bill. The bill came only in late June and both my wife and I were plesantly surprised there was more than 30% savings to put bill. And what's more we were given the $50 discount as part of the promotional exercise in its push for early subscribers. We really hope we had signed up earlier. In fact we have had been advocating this switch over to Keppel Electric to many of our colleagues and friends and especially b our relatives. Many were skeptical, still others were plain lazy or lethargic to make the sswitch. I actually showed them evidence of the savings in my bills. Like many of them I was also reluctant to make the switch because I did not want to take the trouble to get out of the comfort zone initially until one of my church friends shooed me his bill savings too. I really hope many of my relatives will heed my recommendation and know it is genuine. Am greatful to having switched to Keppel   Poh "
5,"Recently I have move to a new premise. Thanks to Keppel electric dedicated customer service, my account was transferred without delay and hustle free."

5,"Glad I made the switch to keppel. I save up to $60 monthly. Regreted that I took the 24mths plan. Should have opp or the 26mths instead. Hope comes renewal, there will be loyalty special gor stay on customers. Tks Keppel."

4,"I signed up for the Fixed 36 Plan, conversion was easy as there were only some simple verification steps. My bills were around $10-$20 cheaper a month, and the customer portal was convenient to track my bills and monthly electrical usage. Payment via credit card is fuss-free too. Recommended! "
3,"Giro was fast approved, although my keppel portal was created during my switch to keppel, as every month i did submit my meter reading thru SP Supply , only the switch from may -june electric readings was shown on my SP statement but on July there was no readings shown even on my keppel portal it was always blank ,i called customer service they told me there will be readings updated till to date almost 2 months there was nothing shown i hope in future electric reading n billings will be clearer stated for easy reference as everything was online unlike SP Supply sending paper statement Monthly."
4,"We switch to keppel electric fixed rate 24 since last year 2018, we are happy with the savings on electricity bill."

4,We switch to keppel Electric since April. Everything is per normal.  No transitional hiccup. I received $80 rebate from keppel Electric.  The bill comes promptly.  All clearly explained.  Averaging I saved $20 per month.
4,"In general this is not a bad change, as the monthly bill always had one deduction.  Because of our new house, cost on electric is still under review.  Two points to enhence - 1) If any mth rate to estimate, please help indicate in the bill  2)  In the chart of the usage, the month display actually was not the real month when the cost ocurred but the last date of the bill period. Eg.  my bill period from 03-03-2019 to 01-04-2019, bill  dated on 06-05-2019, in the chart, my currect bill figure showed under Apr19. However, it should reflect the Mar19.  Dont know if any user has the same problem as me.  No matter how, I still thank for all your efforts on the service provided.  "

4,"So far have been satisfied with Keppel and its plan. Seamless transition. I am on fixed plan so loving the savings now that the electricity tariff has gone up. However needs more improvement to reward existing customers with freebies, complimentary workshops like what other providers are doing. "
4,I didn't go down to the road show in Tampines but got the road show guy number from my parent.  Very helpful guy even after we had sign on from him when we text him he still service us as he is not from Keppel.  Ii would say the customer services from Keppel is really good and helpful. But i think your billing system need a lot of improvement.  
4,Excited to have Keppel as one the provider for electricity. Keep up and continue to keep rates competitive. Definitely Fixed 24 plan is suitable for my household to keep bills rate low.
3,I think overall experience is pretty fuss-free. Interface super simple and visually nice but the only gripe is their giro application is ultra slow though.
5,Opted for Keppel Electric as it offers one of the best fixed rates as compared to the other providers! 
4,Keppel opened a booth at Shen Shiong Teban. Signed up for Fixed 24 plan. Was given $20 JP voucher. Guy registered for us. It was fuss-free and best plan amongst others at the moment of signing up
5,"Signed up for the ‚ÄúFixed 24‚Äù plan and everything was smooth from the transition to the communication. Keppel electric offers different types of plan, find out your needs and get a plan to cater to it. For example the ‚ÄúFixed+24‚Äù plan offers significantly lower rates during off peak hours (11pm-7am), great for family/individual that are seldom at home or have aircon on during bedtime."
4,"Signed up with them at the roadshow and I got a  limited edition Keppel Electric LED. In additional, I got 30% off my electricity bills! Make the switch today!"
5,"Signed up Keppel Elect in April 2018 and chosen the fixed 16.5. Happy to save money, SPPG keep increasing. Thanks "
5,Chose Keppel Electric as they gave a fixed rate which would save me about 20% for my bills. The increase in electrical tariff will not affect me too. 
4,Signed up with Keppel fixed rate as read that it was the lowest plan from seedly. There were a lot of road shows too and they were helpful to do the conversion
5,Roadshow staff was friendly and explain clearly on their plans. Bill came slightly cheaper. Worth the switch. 
5,"Good customer service, the brand ambassadors gave a clear information and assisted in good comparison between different plans. Good feedback from my friends so far about keppel electric."
4,The switch over to Keppel electric was easy as it can be done online at www.keppelelectric.com in just 3 simple steps. I also got 30% off my first month‚Äôs bill when I made the switch. 
4,Decided to get the fixed discount plan at one of their booth after much deliberation. Was also provided a $30 AsiaMalls voucher. However the ways available to pay the bill was a little confusing.  
4,So far keppel electric is the cheapest. So signed up for this. Can register online or thru the DBS marketplace which makes it even easier
4,"Signed up for the fixed discount plan at a booth and received $30 AsiaMalls voucher.  Opted for GIRO payment (to fulfill my UOB ONE account requirement). However, the sales person at the booth seems clueless about how to fill up the form and my GIRO application was rejected.  Bills are sent via email or are accessed via their online portal. Usage is displayed in a graph to show the usage trend.  Sent an email to them to seek clarification on the bill and on the status of my subsequent GIRO application. Received prompt reply.  Generally, except for the bad GIRO application process, the rest of the aspect are okay. If you prefer to charge via credit card, the process should be much easier as you can do so via their portal. "
4,"Locked in fixed rate for convenience lowest at that point of time. $ bill reveals consumption usage at one glance, don't need to factor rate change. "
4,"Have invested in Funding Societies for around 3 months now. Invested in total of 10 loans.  3 invoice financing have been completed. 2 paid on time and 1 had a partial early repayment.   Here are my views on Funding Societies:   Pros: - Process of the account is pretty fast. Took around 1 working day for me to deposit.            - Deposits of the $1000 was easy and fast. Took around 2 working days.            - Withdrawal was also fast. Took around 2 working days to be in my bank account.           - App feature on phone is easy to navigate. Plain and simple.            - Factsheets are detailed.            - Having good annualized portfolio performance.   Cons: - Loans opportunities are pretty low. (This is positive actually as this mean FS screen the borrowers thoroughly, lower defaults).            - Having a min and max amount to invest.            - A riskier alternative investment.             - Loans get filled up quickly. So have to camp few mins before the start time as i manual invest. "
5,"I signed up a Funding Societies account and it was in-force since 24 November 2015 . On average, the investment returns is about 1% monthly . I encountered about 3 loan investments that were late in repayments, hence I received additional returns due to late interest repayments. In addition, I encountered 1 loan investment that went default in repayments but in the end I got back the principle, plus expected returns and additional returns due to 5-month late repayments. Highly recommended! "
4,"Decided to invest some of my money for risky investment onto the platform. Here are some of my thoughts.  1) Onboarding process might be a little troublesome. But their customer service is quite helpful. Also, I feel that the onboarding process might be due to regulations.   2) Other than that, the user interface is modern and nice. Plus they have a mobile app which works for millennials like myself.  3) I can't seem to get any loans invested when I do it manually. The need for auto-allocation also means that I can't select my loans much. I believe this is due to the demand for it being higher than the supply of P2P loans.   4) Already on my 13th loans, so far with little issues of default and everything was easy to use.  I have yet to withdraw any money from the platform. Will keep this review updated."
4,Here are my thoughts on the product overall... been using it for almost a month.  Pros: - Opened up my world of P2P investing which I never knew much about - Relatively clear website with easy to understand visuals and areas - Seems like a pretty rigourous KYC (know your customer) process to screen the loans and users - Auto invest setting seems interesting (but has not yet worked for me yet)  Cons: - The whole onboarding process took really long like almost 4 days long - Had documents to eSign and send to them to be verified - Biggest con was the lack of deals and loans available to users  Will update as I continue to use this product to share on the returns and defaults especially :) 
1,"With referece to the recent post https://blog.seedly.sg/p2p-comparison/ the 0% is not accurate. I'm a fs investor and I have 4k sgd worth of defaults. Which unfortunately I am not able yo upload a screenshot here. The borrower who went default, their fact sheet was not showing any red flags until they decided not to pay. If we can no longer rely on fact sheet for investment decision, then what else can we look at?  Their updates on missed and defaulted payments are irregular and not prompt.   I have stopped all investment and pulling out my funds. "
4,"Pros: - Learned invoice funding from other tech blog and chances upon FS that allows me to dip into invoice funding which was good to cut away middle man cost/fees (except FS fees which is 15%)  - Relatively clear website with easy to understand visuals than MS with cluttered website  - Auto invest save all the time and effort (like RSP ETF) without any user intervention at all - Some loans is 1 to 3 months up to 12 months, thus can be short and long term investment  - Biggest Pros: Mobile apps allow reactive tracking and checking of investment anytime/anywhere conveniently as compare to the other two P2P platform.   - TIps: Limit your eggs small ($100 per case) and put into many basket will be a good way to reduce the risk of loss in case of loan default.   Cons: -  If Auto invest settings mismatch with loans offer (eg. interest and min amount), won't be able to join at all and hence will lose any chance of investing in that particular loan  - Deals and loans available to users was alright (min 1 and max 3 per week in late 2017) - Auto invest won't engage if demand is more than supply (and happen that I don't get auto allocated), then we can only see the deal FLY AWAY!!! in front of our eyes :(   - Biggest Cons: No clear breakdown of each loan service fee and tax (only show totals) , hence unable to easily review each loan's services fee, tax and hence unable to measure the performance of each loan investment "
5,"Started investing on the platform in Sep 2017. I've had 25 loans so far (19 ongoing). There's one loan with late payments (a few times throughout the entire loan period) but they update very clearly and promptly.  What I really like is the investor app, it's super useful and the pre-crowdfunding notifications are very timely. I hardly login the web portal because the app is super easy to use with the Touch ID login and most of the details I need. But then again, I have created 3 auto-invest profiles and only login every now and then."
5,"The live Q&A is pretty prompt. Customer service is good, and there are regular loans to fund. However, the min amount has dropped to $20 and sometimes we do not get loans, I guess due to the larger number of users. The low default rate offers a greater peace of mind too!"
5,Investor since Jun 2017. Had been through more than 150 investments. Annualised performance in app shows 11.9%. Responsive customer service!
3,"I've been using FS for about 5 months. After studying the numbers and returns, i've decided that p2p lending is not really suitable in terms of capital gain (but that's different for individuals).  For FS - on average there are 4-6 loans available for you to back every month. As mentioned by other users, as the loans offers attractive returns, there are a lot of retail investors eyeing to be part of the loan package.  Eg of a loan: 100k loan available with 12% returns in 3 months, min & max investment $100. When it is announced at 7pm, 7.10pm the 100k would have been fully backed.   Another con is that, your money would be tied up and there are no liquidity in that. Only way for you to get your money back is when the companies you loaned to make the monthly payment.   I've made a rough calculation on all the loan returns, while the reported interest rates are between 9 - 12%, after taking into consideration of the fees, averaging the time frame, assuming no defaults, the return looks like a 6-8%.   For many, this may be attractive because it is higher than your savings account, but because of its illiquid nature, and higher perceived risk, i think there are other better performing asset classes. Eg: REITs - some reits returned way better returns than 6-8% in 2017, somemore it is liquid with potential upsides in capital gain, or if you have an even higher risk profile, tech stocks did really well in 2017 globally + in Singapore.   So FS is suitable for individuals with a mid level risk profile, but less suitable for individuals with a high risk profile. :) "
4,"Been using since 2017.  Pros:  - Automatic investing, with multiple settings to cater to your risk level and preferred diversification.  - Low barrier to entry. Can start with $100. - Have both P2P loans and invoice financing. - Platform displays a clearly laid out timetable for loans and their statuses. - Regular updates on defaulted or delayed loans.  Cons: - No fractional investing. - Offers are quickly snapped up even with automatic investing. - As with all p2p investing, there are defaults. "
4,"Been using for a couple of months now. I find the auto-invest function pretty good and fuss-free. Returns are pretty high (currently at 11.56%). The app is quite nice but might get confusing to use at times. For eg, the income summary displays only the monthly summary instead of a year to date version. Can't really tell how the annualised performance is computed."
5,"Started in Aug, 35 invested, 29 ongoing, returns are quite gd at 12.41% when annualised. If i make a transfer at midnight, it will deposited into my account by 10am in the morning, very efficient! The Auto-Investment feature is very useful as well, secures me a min $20 investment, with additional when it is opened.  Currently, FS is offering the BEST referral deal in awhile. I didnt even get any when i signed up :/ so dont miss this opportunity! Get $19 cashback when you sign up with Funding Societies and invest any amount by 15Oct. PM me if you want the referral code :)"
2,"I have income earnings of $140 and $240 in defaults. I noticed a huge rise in defaults recently, so i stopped investing and withdrew all the remaining money. Not worth the risk-reward in my opinion"
5,"*Updated with links of my result , and referral code on the comments I have invested in FS for 3 months. 2 late payment. 7 completed invoice payment (on-time), 4 term loan (on-time). Add- on to Jay Liu's review (his reviews touchest almost everything): Pros: -Responsive replies and advice from the SG admins which takes about less than 3 days. Slightly longer for the FS MY as they have more investors - have a p2p lending forum to feedback and enquire any defaulted loan (users are mostly Malaysian). Good culture inside - have been improving their apps and more loans and increasing loan sums are available - loans are notified via phone notification so that you can have a quick-scan and analysis on loans' factsheet  -place priority for new investors (, etc) with auto-invest -  there is a priority list so that every investors could earn their bits. Interested investors could otherwise manually invest.  Cons like what is stated by Jay Liu could be looked at on a different light as it shows that the evaluators are serious and prudent in the assessment of borrowers' funds  Link of my 4-5 months results: https://crowdfundtalks.com/topic/725/p2p-lending-5-months-on-fs-sg"
5,"1. I invested similar amounts in both Funding Societies (FS) and Moolahsense (MS) around early 2018, as an experiment.   2. To me, MS started out as having an edge over FS due to its more intuitive, user-friendly site, and more information on the loans available.  3. Since then, Moolahsense has been lagging behind. They reacted much later to the market offering lower loan quantums (e.g. minimum $500 per loan rather than $10 vs FS), they also were behind in implementing the automatic investments.  4. With automatic investments turned on, and with similar investment criteria (e.g. min. $50, up 3 month loan only, specific sectors only etc.), I personally experienced a default rate of MS loans 4-5 times that of FS. Something like 5 of every 10 in MS compared with 1-2 per 10 in FS.  5. Close to Default and Default handling procedures - I would say FS trumps MS big time. MS basically gave me the feeling that they won't do anything extra to help investors. FS has skin in the game, and to me they seem to go the distance to ensure the success of the loans.  6. Observed the CEOs of both companies at some fintech events. The FS guys seem a lot more genuine than the MS one. Note: this is my subjective opinion.  I could go on, but I think the above would perhaps would provide some perspective to help the community decide which platform to try out."
4,"Have been invested in funding societies since late January. Total returns currently as stated in the app is 8% per annum. Having said that, I have 3 deals which are defaulted and the expected repayment dates are in about a year. Hoping to get back my capital at least. "
4,This by far the most sophisticated P2P lending platform. There are definitely things to improve but I love how detailed the fact sheet of each loan is done
3,"I was keen to try out P2P lending so I signed up for an account with Funding Societies since it has the best record (lowest default rate) compared to platforms. However, it has been a few weeks but my account still hasn't been activated yet. I've filled up the Subscription Agreement but have yet to receive the eSign Subscription Agreement. Not sure if it's because they will give you a call before proceeding with the application. If so, I probably missed the call since I'm currently serving NS (out for training during the day). "
3,"Have been investing with FundingSocieties over two years now, funded 80 loans as of today with 22 ongoing. Few initial big blows with 6defaults so far and trying to recover my capital losses. Mobile app is very friendly. "
4,Have been in the investing journey with Funding Society for half a year. I have to say it have the best track record with the lowest default rate. I believe they have a stringent credit and efficient collection team. It's app function is amazing to the fact that I prefer to use its mobile app rather than the website. The only drawback is that max investment amount is low if you have a large capital to invest. It can really take a long time to fully utilize it. I hope to see better info on repayment as well as it is not very detailed and complicated to navigate. Hope the FS teams see this feedback! :)
4,"- Really user-friendly and nice app UI - Like the auto-reinvestment feature as it means I don't have to worry much - However, some loans and invoice take slightly longer than expected to be repaid - Constantly new initiatives and updates improve the credibility of the company"
4,"Pros: - Wonderful app design, easy to navigate and use - Responsive customer service - Minimum investment threshold is low (about $50) - Auto-invest option  Cons: -  Maximum investment threshold is usually low (about $50) - Risky as an investment option, a few late payments within a few months of investing (no default)  Overall, a very good P2P lending platform."
4,"have been using FS for close to year now , i would this is good given the return i have seen with this passive investment, just that  i dont see enough campaigns sometimes leading to funds left ldle for a while , suggest to keep a watch and not just rely on auto invest only to best invest your funds on time."
5,"Have been using it for about 6 months. the UI takes some time to get used to, but once you understand it, its quite alright?  The borrowers have also been repaying the loans in a timely manner which is awesome. Grew about 2.5% in 6 months. hopefully this continues to about 5% pa, then i would say its quite a good platform for passive investments."
5,"not enough loan out every week. Hence, if you put 10k in and you put $100 per loan, it may take forever to get the 10k out and your 10k could be sitting in their account for a long long time without interest. You will need 100 loan to get 10k out...it will take forever. You may argue, then set a higher cap, however, do you want to lose more if it default. "
4,low minimum investment of $100 althought there are some loans that have minimum of $500 or even $1000.  Fee charged for arranging the loan.  Offers both invoice financing and term loan.  Have personally experienced default with them for some loan.  Collection is less agressive compared to other p2p lender.  They offer malaysian riggit loans to Malaysia companies as well.  So far malaysia loans 100% with no default. Need to set up a separate account to invest in Malaysia.  Loans in RM.
5,One of the only platforms with a mobile app. Fast and clean interface. Customer support directly available via the app.   Crowdfunding closes out in a very quickly and you might miss out. Auto-investment function helps to a certain extent.  Low learning curve for p2p lending is suitable for new investors.
5,"I joined FS SG in July 2017 and have participated in 45 loans (29 ongoing), returns average slightly under 1% nett per month. I reinvest the returns and will try to update the compounded interest in another 6 months. There have been no defaults so far, 3 late payments from 3 different loans but all been settled or in the midst of being settled.   I like FS for the simple interface, the live chat team - responds promptly to queries and lastly and more importantly, the quality of loans.   Perhaps I would like to see more loans on FS but after attending one of their sharing sessions, I understand that FS has a rigid screening process for borrowers hence their very low default rate.   Overall, been a positive experience that I have also signed up for FS Malaysia.  I have withdrawn money from FS Malaysia and money was in my  savings account 3-4 days as advertised.      "
5,"More loans available, smooth and professional UI, autoinvest from $100, trustee account."
3,"I have been using Funding Societies for almost half a year. I have been so far satisfied with the product and service from an average consumer perspective.   As a startup executive, I do believe the company could work on improving their overall user experience for onboarded investors. I don't feel the platform is attractive as an investor.  The information provider as well as the medium through which it is provided on the website (as I used the web app all the time on phone and sometimes on laptop), could be streamlined to showcase only the relevant information. Furthermore, I wished to be able to use the platform to review my portfolio, view a clean dashboard showcasing yield among others.   The marketing approach could be improved as per when a new loan or invoice would be posted, rather than being announced on same day. The content marketing from Funding Societies is a bit weak especially at blog content level, although a recent summary of my investment has been sent to me earlier this year (well done).   For prospective investors as well as newbie investors, it is quintessential that Funding Societies provide a tool to enable the investor to calculate his/her potential earnings. A bonus would be to have scenarios in case of default(s). "
4,Pro: Love the response time and app interface. Con: Not enough deals so sometime your funds are unused inside. For Info: Fee is charged for every transaction so withdraw is kinda free
1,"I had a complimentary travel insurance with AIG from Citibank Premiermiles in the past (about 1/2 years ago). The claim process was so long and they were very unprofessional in handling the claim when they know that it is a complimentary travel insurance. I have to call in several times, getting pushed to different departments before getting my answer.   When I submitted my medical receipts for processing, no reply was given from AIG and my claim was left hanging. I have to call the staff 2 weeks later, which they claim that they did not receive until I make some noise before they suddenly ""found the receipts"" and process the claim.   Complained to the staff but doesn't seem to have any impact/updates from them thereafter. "
5,"AIG Travel Guard Direct provides four plan types with varying levels of. coverage. Choose the one that best suits your travel needs. Insure, spend and travel wisely with AIG Travel Guard Direct!"
5,Best travel insurance ever I‚Äôve purchased. Just claimed for my baggage delay‚Äôs compensation within a week. 
1,Their United Network Free Wi-Fi is a joke! can't use at all! I was travelling to Phuket and expect to use it when I'm there. can't find any hotspot to connect. Don't ever buy it. I paid for the Supreme (the most expensive package). The Mobile App keep hanging on my phone.
3,"Easy to apply as it is found in all AXS, Booking Platform is neat and i can use my promo code for discounted rate."
5,On their annual travel plan the last few years... made a claim once for stolen items and had almost full amount compensated. Process was straightforward and quick!
4,"Buying a policy is buying a contract!  AIG may sell one of the most expensive but in between the policy year, they don't add in new terms.  Fastesr claim among the rest and can get paid within 7 working days "
5," I travel quite a bit and i am a careless traveller... lol.   Once, i lost my passport and had to reschedule my flight. I panicked and called AIG (which i got an annual plan) and the customer service helped me to change my tickets immediately without any additional cost (note: i was a student then and got the tickets from STA travel and it was a low cost, no change open jaw kinda ticket). I was sold on AIG immediately :)   To be fair, i also tried others- MSIG was easy for claiming the loss of personal belongings (a camera to be exact), but not for flight delays ( in one of the tour group, the only guy that got MSIG didn't manage to get the delay payout after months whereas those of us with AIG got it in a month), directasia insurance sees to claims but doesn't provide much help if you get into a fix overseas and the wise traveller is a newbie onboard that also provides freebies like cheaper hotel stays/ local discounts :)   i also got AXA, QBE, fwd and etiqa for short trips before- but nothing has really happened so i can't comment!"
5,"Started with SC 5 years ago when they have no minimum commission. It was great until they changed to have minimum $10 commission in 2016. To be fair, all brokerages have a minimum too, and some as high as $25. Now $10 is the benchmark.  If you are a Priority customer (having $200,000 total assets) with SC, then congrats you have the no minimum commission, and a slightly lower 0.18% (for SGX) commission.  Yet, the 0.2% commission for regular customer is still the lowest among local brokerages. Though they are custodian, they don't charge for any corporate announcements.  Website & App is pretty clean, but room for improvements.  My preferred brokerage."
5,"Personally trade on SCB platform. Havent done much, only a few trades.  Started out by opening an account with SCB at the bank.  The person that attended to me was very nice, professional. She answered all my questions clearly. Although it would be better if there were some essential information given to me.. maybe like a handbook or something. LOL i that time just start so a lot things don't know.  Then also the paper works i signed i didnt have a copy of it ): .. I also forget to request a photocopy of it. Don't know if its SOP.   But the opening of account is really fast. My SCB account opened faster than my another account by a week. It takes if im not wrong approx 1 ~ 2 weeks to open sc trading acc.   My experience with their customer service is pretty good. SCB is my first platform, so naturally a lot of things I don't know. Especially how to use their platforms, understanding different words means what, how they derive their profit & loss in my portfolio etc. A lot of things I don't know uh, damn confused at the start. Made me lose $20 .. ):  Then I called their trading hotline. My experience:  1: They pick up damn fast. Like literally 0 waiting time.  2: The customer service personnel was very patient with my questions. Answered them diligently and clearly. I ask a lot like those simple questions, then they not impatient.  3: There were questions they couldn't answer and said that it has to be referred to the technical department. And will call me back. Next day or 2 days later got 2 calls. One from the original personnel attending to my question, the other was from the technical department. Both clarified my questions.   Walk into any Stand chart bank. tell them u wanna open a trading account. they'll do everything for you. Note that SCB are the custodian of your shares. So unlike UOBkh / dbs vickers etc, your shares arent put into your CDP acc.  SCB also requires you to open an esavers account with a minimum maintanece of 1k inside the account. if not they charge u $5 every month.. :( cb..   Then got account liao can use their platform to buy or sell shares lor! But like need transfer money into sc securities then got money then can trade. then earnings or loss go back securities. then around 3 working days the money can put inside your savings account. bla bla . u walk into any SCB they explain in detail for you.   Overall experience was pleasant with SCB. And also trade with them cause fees low. hehe. i poor. no money.  P.S. Would be nice if they would revert back to their own ways.. no minimum fee "
4,"Very much improved user interface compared to years ago. SCB is really making an effort to compete with other brokerages.  No custodian fees. Shares are NOT kept in CDP. Low brokerage fees. Access to most overseas markets  However, foreign exchange rate is not very good.   Good watchlist and price quote interface. Able to see buying power, portfolio and stock info."
4,Been using since 2015. No problems so far with SC. Cheaper fees. Simple trades for simple retail investors.
5,"Started with SC a couple of years back when they have no min commission, till they charged the min $10 comm or 0.2% of the transaction value (whichever is higher). Painful, but other brokerages have min comms too, so it was a good run while it lasted.  Still using it till now as the I've been using it for so long and the interface suits my needs. Take note that your stocks will be held in a custodian account and not your CDP."
4,"Set up this account when there was no fees in the beginning. I didn't care if it's custodian - what matters is I earn the money from investments!  When they introduced fees later on I thought of switching - because the old interface wasn't user friendly. But switching is a chore (so choose your service provider wisely).  Then after that they improved the interface - had to re-learn how to use the portal. However, it's worthwhile - I loved the new interface after getting used to it. Very easy to see the data that I'm looking for, and the search function for the stock works.  But don't rely on this brokerage to recommend shares - it doesn't! Very neutral platform, so do your research elsewhere."
4,"SC Trading account, very troublesome interns of signing up as you have to go down to a branch and sign forms? Thank God i worked near a SC branch, however going down several times after signing up to sign more forms were very bothersome. Was wondering if any banks allow scanned copies of forms?  Overall, nice place but still not up to par with the rest! Could use some awareness with roadshows etc etc"
4,"If one is OK with custodian holding,  sc is highly recommended because it has the lowest commission cross buy/sell trade.  Rather slow mobile brokerage app though "
4,"Pro No dividend handling fee,no custodian fee  Cons Exchange rate is not that nice,user interface is not user friendly"
1,Used to have this trading account but have stopped using it due to the website being unstable and slow in loading at times.
5,"One of the lowest minimum commission ($10) out there and cost/fess is important because they eat into your return especially when you just started to invest. Yes, it is a custodian account but there is really not much difference unless if you want to attend AGM. Otherwise, you will still be able to participate in all the relevant corporate actions (dividends, rights, etc.) at no additional cost. There are other brokerages that charge custodian fees, dividend handling fees, etc...  Continue to invest and build your portfolio until it is > $200,000 and you get to become a priority customer with the bank. As a priority customer, there will be no minimum commission :) I can always enter/buy rights, illiquid stocks without buying a minimum commission."
5,"I have been trading with SCB platform since the days they had no minimum commission. All of a sudden they also started charging the minimum commission for each trade (Of course if you are a Premium account holder there is no minimum commission). Now I am feeling the pinch. If they could revert back to the old system of no minimum brokerage it will be much good. Other than that there are a lot of advantages with SCB trading. The money management is easy. You can transfer in and out of SCB trading account to your e$avings account by just a stroke in your internet banking. As far Corporate actions are concerned it is lethargic procedure with SCB for US Stocks. They will send you a few pages of paper every time and ask you to choose the option of receiving dividend as Cash/Equity. Even if you are interested to leave a blanket instruction it will not be accepted. I think they should change this. Overall my experience with SCB is ""Very Good"" and I am planning to upgrade to Premium status soon. Thiagarajan Veerappa Chettiar"
4,I have been with SCB trading since 2014.   Things that I like  1) cheaper trading fees 2) integration with the banking side of the web portal is good   Things that need improvement  1) charting  2) interface for the trading page   Would I recommend it ? Generally yes 
4,"Been using it since 2017.  Very simple interface, and easy to get started. Has a friend referral program. Breakdown of what your portfolio invests in, profits/loss, fees involved, etc Up to 10 levels of Risk score to modify your portfolio accordingly Low minimum investment required, $100"
5,"Smartly has been great for me so far. Easy to get into. I've set up auto-investment of $200 a month for many months now, nothing fanciful but the returns have been pretty good.  "
5,"I use both StashAway and Smartly for about half a year. I got 6.6% on Smartly, 10/10 risk and 2.7% on StashAway, highest-risk portfolio. I have experienced automated rebalancing on both platforms and really happy with it. I guess the difference with the returns is with their investing method Modern Portfolio Theory (Smartly) vs Economic Regime-based Asset Allocation (StashAway). Just got into the working world, and these 2 are my first few investments. Can't wait to see future results! "
5,Joined from February and with the current bull market the return as of now is 5%. If you put in 10k the fee charged is 0.7 percent. If you transfer monthly you'll get 84 free days hence it's more like 0.54 percent fee.
5,I have been a smartly customer since September 2017 and very satisfied so far. I have originally put in a lump sum and now also set up a recurring transfer because I get 25% more off the fees for this. Also my portfolio grows faster as I spend less. 
4,"Very easy to set up and use. Very fast Sms notification once money is received by them. Provides the individual portfolio returns  in sgd after fees 10 different risk profile to select   For risk profile of 8/10, 6.7‚Ä∞ returns on investment from Jun 2017. Combined returned 3.7‚Ä∞ over 4 portfolios done by ad hoc monthly contribution of varying amounts   "
5,Low barrier to entry so it is suitable for anyone to explore with different portfolios to gain more exposure or get comfortable.
4,Joined for 25 months. With +5.6% in portfolio returns. Used standing instruction to transfer monthly investments. 7 days free management monthly.
2,It has been more than a year since I opened my account. I even topped up whenever there is a loss. It just went down further. Been a year now and no gain at all. Only some fees deducted
4,"Knew about Smartly through Facebook advertisements and that was when I first heard of robo advisors. They captured my attention through their tagline ""Anyone can be an investor"". Although sceptical at first, I decided to try it since there was only a minimum of $50 required. The sign up process was smooth and quick, my account got verified about a day later. Deposited $50 and currently monitoring the progress. Hope that they will come up with a mobile application like StashAway soon so that I can monitor my investment easily on the go. "
5,Smartly is so much easier as other robo equity advisors in Singapore. Thumbs up!  I have been a client since 2017 October.  Kristjan Kangro
5,I signed up and was validated on same day. Next day I sent funds and they were invested on same day. So far no complaints. Understand app is also coming soon.
5,"Pros: Fast set-up and alot of information given about portfolios, where exactly my money will go etc. Free to withdraw any time Fractional shares Cons: Could give choice of changing some ETF-s in portfolio. But I guess this would be more for traders."
5,"Very simple and clean interface, easy to sign up. Using since February and set an autodeposit. Funds have always been invested on the same day! "
5,Been using since November and I‚Äôm pleased with the returns and experience so far. Prompt reply on my enquiry too!
5,"Overall Review: I am extremely satisfied with Smartly. As a mid-20's professional looking for an easy way to invest safely without going through the overly complicated, fee driven banking systems, this has been my ideal go-to solution. There are no hidden fees, there is no complicated requirements which makes things really easy to trust.  Basically, Smartly delivers on what it promises, lower fees than banks - same product with more transparency.   Start Date: 11/2017 - Risk Profile of 5/10 with return of ~.8% Set Up: Super simple UI and UX - takes less than 5 minutes to create profile and very fast identification verification within 1-2 days Speed: From depositing funds via bank transfer to investing takes about ~3 days. 1. You get a fast SMS notification of funds received 2. 2-3 days later those funds are deposited.  Support: Feedback on product is taken very seriously - the team will implement simple changes within days which was really cool! "
5,"This investment platform is a game changer! Highly user friendly, fits into anyone (new, amateur or professional). Processes are simple and easily understandable. I have been using Smartly since 2 months ago, investment is quick compared to many other traditional investment services, with clear details of how your investment is performing. Highly recommended to all! "
5,"Low minimum amount required, extremely easy to use and quick to setup - basically a well-diversified portfolio for almost anyone out there. Now you have no excuse not to start investing from a young age!"
5,"The low minimum investment and friendly user interface make it very easy for anyone to create their portfolio. Plus, the ability to create different portfolios with different risk levels makes me feel I'm in control of my finances.  Smartly being regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore is one of the reasons why I trust it."
5,User friendly and safe platform for new or veteran micro investors! This is great starting point for anyone looking to get into investment.
5,"Easy to use platform for a real low starting sum. Great for individuals who wish to start in their investment journey at a low starting capital . Thus , a platform made for the young millennials . "
5,Low minimum investment amount with a easy to use clean interface. Definitely a better choice!
5,What i really like about Smartly is their user interface which is designed to be clean and simple therefore it will be easier & much more convenient to use.
4,"Signed up for Smartly & StashAway, and deposited cash funds for investment on the 9th.   Smartly - Deposits received on 10th morning, auto invested into ETFs on 10th night. (Because NYSE market open 9:30am US time = 10:30pm SG time)  StashAway - Deposits received only on the 11th morning, not yet invested into anything yet as of now 11:20pm.   I would say StashAway has a downside in this aspect, longer waiting time for funds to be invested after deposit (more concerned for those with recurring deposits like monthly or quarterly etc.)"
4,"I subscribed to Whizcomm when I moved out of my parents' place this year.   Price: 5/5 The reason I chose Whizcomm was that it was the cheapest no-frills 1Gbps plan available. They don't charge activation fee, and have free delivery and installation on off-peak time slots (weekdays, working hours). So if you have someone staying home this might work for you. I had to pay extra for a weekend installation because both my wife and I work.   Unfortunately, you don't get a free router at this price, but luckily we had an extra from our old homes. You can always pay for one though. You also have to pay a deposit.  Ease of signing up: 5/5 Just fill up an online form and everything's settled. You don't even pay upfront. Compared to other telcos such as MyRepublic this process was a lot easier.  Customer service: 3/5 Whizcomm really falls short here. Firstly, their engineers who installed the internet were very junior and seemed quite unsure about their technical stuff. Not very confidence-inspiring.  Secondly, it is not very easy to get information from them. I was not given an invoice for my first bill, and was not given any information on when I would be billed. They also took 2 days to get back to my email enquiry. It's a far cry from services provided by telcos such as Circleslife, where you can get all the information you need via the app.   Internet connectivity and speed: 4/5 The optical network terminal (modem) provided free by them is not very reliable. Sometimes it doesn't connect to the internet and I have to reset it by turning the plug off and on again (it has no off and on switch on the device itself). Quite troublesome.   Internet speed is reliable when it does work though, and doesn't drop suddenly.  Overall score: 4/5 Pretty good, more or less happy with them, but not perfect. "
5,"I was one of the pioneer customers of Whizcomms in Jan 2017 I took their 1Gbps link up as a backup link to my fibre internet. Cost wise it is one of the lowest and no frills ISP.  In terms of speed it is quite good and reasonable, about 900Mbps for a wired lan connection. Taking them up again this month after getting rid of Viewqwest. "
5,"I switched from Singtel to WhizComms Fibre Broadband due to the former didn't fully addressed the network issues and technical glitches. WhizComms is brilliant!! their service is fast, and willing to give me a better router. The set up was effortless and swift, it was amazing!  So far I am with them for slightly more than a year, no network issue, all are working fine. I will definitely continue with them, as for the same speed, I was paying double of the price previously with Singtel.  Keep up the good work and thank you."
5,"It is among the cheapest, very reliable, good support and value for money. Overall better than my previous Service Provider."
4,The plans are way too expensive and needs to be tweaked to attract customers. The sub charges are too expensive.
5,It is among the cheapest plan i have encountered. Reasonably reliable. Good support. In short value for money
4,"I've been using their service since February this year. I subscribed to their promotion during the CNY period, 1Gbps 24-Month (Mesh Wi-Fi Solution) Incl. Askey AP5100W (2 Units). Generally the internet seems to be alright but at night it is cranky with really low speed and sometimes timeout. I don't really have much complain but if the connection is better at night it will be great. I am going to shift house from west to north-east next week. I am looking forward to see if the connection is going to be affected in anyway. Will comment again after move."
4,Cheap and reliable and customer service is great and very good.But service not available everywhere in Singapore.
5,"I subscribed to WhizComms 500mbps No-Frills 24m Plan at the IT Comex Show.   3 reasons I decided on this plan after researching:   1. WhizComms provides a no-frills plan (no router), most of the other providers bundle the cost of the router together with the plan. As I have an existing router, the no-frills plan saves me $100+ which I can use to buy a good router from Challenger if required.  2. 500mbps is sufficient for our usage given there are only 2 of us with 2 devices each (computer & phone).  3. Most wallet-friendly compared to other ISPs  The sales person was very patient in explaining all the tiny details to us, including the fact that the modem is a loan, we would have to return the modem to them in the even we choose not to renew our subscription after the end of the contract.   Installation was fuss-free and so far the connection has been stable and fast. Will recommend!"
5,"Decide to sign up after comparing across all the ISP for 1GPS with cheapest provider for my new home in 2017.  Arranged for the installation and activate the same day when network engineer. Engineer is professional with the network tracking device , although he advise there is no need for additional Wifi mesh as the weakest spot in the house is the toilet where it around around 78% Wifi signal. Wife overwrite the decision to install the mesh with full Wifi coverage at every corner of the house.   "
5,"Having utilised broadband services from several of the industry players before, I‚Äôm pleased to say that Whizcomms have really set a high bar despite being a new entrant to the market. Once I had a double NAT issue with my ONT and I contacted the customer service if they would be as kind as to enable the bridge mode to resolve this issue. The customer service was more than happy to help and said I could bring my ONT over to their office in Kg Ampat to rectify the issue. Upon arriving at their office I was pleased that instead of making me wait (or take a number) for a technician to make the settings on my existing ONT, they recognized that I called earlier and provided me with an ONT that has been configured and I was in and out of the office in less than 2 minutes.   Had this been another provider, I‚Äôm not so sure the experience would have been so seamless. I tip my hat to the folks in Whizcomms for a positive customer experience so far. Kudos Whizcomms!"
5,"Decided to switch to WhizComms broadband for my in-law's home when their contract ended on Dec 18  - they were having a promo and the price for their 1 Gbps plan was one of the cheapest then (definitely look out for promos!).  Their online response and call centre is responsive and free installation could be arranged on a weekday (9 - 5.30pm). Great that the installer could do it and set everything up for them without me having to be there to check that it's done properly.  The speeds for the 1 Gbps 2-year plan feels pretty consistent. Definitely more stable than my in-law's previous broadband plan with another company. For reference, their home is in the Bedok area - signal is okay, no interruptions whenever I visit on the weekends and use the wifi."
1,"As it's name suggest, good for public transport at 2% on ez-link auto top-up!  other than that, the cash back on other category is not as good as other card such as BOC family card. "
5,"It is one of the great card to own it as the rebate system makes me spend even more on taking public transportation.   As i spend more on public transportation, the rebates allows me to earned more at the same time."
1,Can't recommend this. 5% savings on fast food/movies and groceries and no convenience charge on auto reload of Ezlink but that's about it. UOB one card or YOLO card is a good alternative.
5,Easy and hassle free card to use with the EZ-Reload feature and you can even get up to 2% of savings when you do so if you hit the min spending of $300.
4,Thank you for your helpfully For your good service and Kylie I hope in future updates the service more likely for your service 
4,This card has EZ-Reload enabled on it with no convenience fee for EZ-Reload auto top-up transactions.  
4,"You might think that SMRT is the source of all your problems, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should refuse to sign up for the Citibank SMRT Card out of spite. Its name might make it sound like a glorified EZ-Link card, but it‚Äôs actually one of the better cashback credit cards available right now."
4,"When you get the card, it will automatically have EZ-Reload enabled on it. There‚Äôs no convenience fee for EZ-Reload auto top-up transactions, and you can get up to 1.7% or 2% (if you hit the min. spend of $300) in rebates. It‚Äôs not great lah, but we‚Äôll take what we can get."
5,This card is useful for transport and easily auto credit to your card and you do not need to worry about insufficient credit 
4,Signed up this card to get the $200 lazada voucher promo. Using this card for the following purposes: - my primary EZ-Link card as it gives cashback - when buying MacDonald  - when I have maxed out my DBS live fresh credit card cap for online spending
4,"Used to be can exchange the SMRT$ (rebate) for vouchers to top up the EZ-Link card, but they stopped that. Now only can use to exchange other kind of vouchers like Giant, Popular.  But lately I noticed that they allow exchanging of the rebate for cash rebate. Which to me is the best, compared to exchanging for vouchers at shops that I don‚Äôt want to shop at. The cash rebate has to be done thru SMS. See their product page for the exact details!"
4,Good card to use as ezlink reload. No extra charge for reloading. A good card for groceries shopping as well. I always carry this card with me whereever I go.
4,Great everyday card to use with low minimum spend. Great for those starting out. Auto ez load function could use some tweaking to make changing the auto load amount easiler 
2,2% cashback on ez-link expenses. But its cashback is in SMRT$ and can be redeemed in unit of $5 or $10 only.
4,Pros: Really like the rebate even if we do not meet the minimum spending of $300.   Good for Ez-link reload as a transport card. **Take note to change the Ezlink reload to $40/$50 instead of the initial $30 when you successfully applied for the card to enjoy maximum rebate. **  Con: not sure about what constitutes the online transaction portion. Dining is mainly for fast-food and coffee. Groceries need to be above transaction spending of $50
5,Used this card mainly for public transport as I can't drive.  Convenience fee wavier for EZ-Reload Auto Top-up transactions.  Up to 2% rebate for EZ-Reload Auto Top-up.  Highly recommended for public transport goers!
2,"Card feature was actually above average. Used it for daily commute and some misc spending.  Then posb everyday card came, and enhanced the features.   2 star because of the poor customer service "
4,"I have recently graduated and since I don't spend more than $500 on my expenses in a month, with the cashback I think its really better than POSB Everyday card. I use it as my ezlink card and get cashback from movies, online shopping and food. Of course, for those who spend more than $500 a month and travel frequently may not find this to be the best card. I am really satisfied with it at this point of time :) Just note there's a maximum cashback of like $20 a month if you fulfil some criteria."
2,Good for Ez-link rebates but is difficult to get a card waiver as the bank is not really flexible and make it very troublesome. I have cancelled the card.
2,"It's a card that I have always wanted to try due to the higher rebate on public transport (something that most credit cards do not offer) and grocery spending.  However, their response is quite slow. And it's not for those who just started off on their new job or in transition to a new job because they require you to produce your employment letter (in full, not just the first page) in order to apply."
4,"A great card especially for groceries shopping which you can get 2.7% if spend less than $50, 4.7% if more than $50. For movies wise, you can get 4.7% at cinemas, for food wise you can get 4.7% for most fast food chain and finally for public transportation, you can get 1.7% if u top up more than $30. It's a much more valued added card for me as it's relevant to my daily lifestyle."
2,"Looks good only, claim to be 4.7% for things like fast food. However you need to spending above $50 dollars for a single transaction for the rebbate to be 4.7%, else it would be downgraded to 2.7 %.  Sure it gives 1.7% on transport - ezlink. Thats probably about as good as it gets. "
4,Use it daily as my ez-link. Zero auto reload fees. Great for buying groceries (read: Beer) at NTUC. Only gripe I have is that it no longer offers SMRT vouchers you can exchange the reward points for (totally removes the point of it being a co-branded cc). Back to 5 stars once this will be available again.
4,"I like that it gives decent rewards for minimal usage. I use this card mainly for its 2% ez-link rebate and 10%+5% rebates at Starbucks (10% as Citi Rebate in your card with minimum $10, and 5% SMRT rebate for cafes). I can redeem $10 GIant/Sheng SIong vouchers easily after a few months, (more if you add supermarkets or online). Good for small spenders (and gives pretty practical rewards too). One part to improve is the redemption process (have to log in through PC to redeem, and go to location to exchange letter mailed to voucher)."
4,"Used for about 2 years, mainly for transport and Starbucks. Applied for it together with the Rewards card after i started working.  Quite shiok to have some money back on transport because it's otherwise a cost that i take as sunk.   Looking at earlier reviews, it seems that they have increased the benefits since i applied for it. Might be worth it if you're ok with citibank.  For me I've decided to consolidate my cards rather than pick from a stack depending on merchants so this was one of the cards i decided to do without. Doesnt help also that their customer svc is not the most helpful. I needed to make three calls over one month to finally get my fee waivers. "
5,"The Smrt card is a very good card for a few hidden reasons   I use it mainly for transport and Starbucks top up with gives 10% Citi rebates   You really do not have to hit the min spend monthly and the SMRT rebates add up over the months enough for you to redeem a 10 off a EZtop up   If you do decide to go for the full perks which is pretty good  5% savings* on groceries (7.3% for FairPrice Xtra Kallang Wave) 5% savings* on fast food, movies and coffee 3% savings* on online shopping Redeem your SMRT$ for cash rebate or vouchers No convenience fee charge for EZ-Reload Auto Top-up transactions "
5,"I feel that there is a misconception about this card. Personally this card suits people who just started out using credit card without having to worry about minimum spend. Even though there is technically $300 minimum spend, the additional rebates u get is only like 0.3% extra. For groceries u get 2.7% if spend less than $50, 4.7% if more than $50 and they cover they 3 major supermarkets which are fairprice, giant and sheng siong. For movies u get 4.7% for 4 cinema which are GV, Cathay, Shaw and Filmgarde, for food u get 4.7% for most fast food chain like KFC and Macs. There also ez link auto reload which i feel is very convenient to use as an ezlink card and u get 1.7% if u top up more than $30. There are also more rebates but i feel they are not as attractive if compared to other cards. Of course, there are downside which is the rebate is in the form of SMRT$ where SMRT$ = $1 but it easy to redeem using SMS and there a cap of $600 redemption per year.  TLDR:  If you are a light spender and using the card for groceries, movies, fast food and ez link without having to worry about minimum spend consider applying for this card. And the card is not particular about exclusion to hit the spending requirements.  Please do not rate a card lowly, it just shows u did not research the card for your use case properly."
5,"Yays  1. This card is actually a hidden gem for those who don't spend alot. The $300 minimum spend is a decoy, because it only means that you get 0.3% less in rebate. The fact that you get SMRT$ in lieu of cash is also a red herring, because you can easily convert your SMRT$ to cash via a quick sms.  2. 1.7% - 2% rebate for public transport  3. 2.7% - 5% rebate for groceries  4. Rebates for S&C charges, telcomm, online spend. A pretty comprehensive card that offers rebates in places that few other cards go.   Nay  1. Its a little tricky keeping all of the different rebates % in mind. Especially when you can't remember which retailer attracts rebates, and how much.    "
3,"The only strength the Citi Ez-link card has is its 2% rebate on transport. However, given that one is unlikely able to spend $300 on public transport travel easily per month, it has to be paired with other categories of expenditure. The best option is groceries and movies which has a 5% rebate. However, other cards have better rebates for movies and groceries with little requirement for min spend.  Given the complexity to pair public transport expense and grocery shopping to get the best out of the card, the Citibank SMRT card can be given a miss. There are better cards out there to suit a financially savvy Singaporean expenditure."
4,"A good mile-buying opportunity for 40,000 miles at SGD 488 (for HSBC Premier clients). The unlimited priority pass for both the principal and supplementary cardholder(s) makes this card worth the fee alone -- provided there are supplementary cardholder(s) to share the benefits with and that it will be heavily utilized. Similarly, the departure airport limo service is a plus point and the meet-and-assist can be helpful at overly crowded airports without Fast-Track/ABTC/Diplomatic lines. For HSBC Premier clients, receiving 4 of each benefit upon registration and an additional of each service for every block of SGD 2,000 spent in a month (up to 24 a year) is another worthy benefit of this card -- though the services can only be utilized by the principal cardholder only. This card is overshadowed by its mediocre mile earn rate of 1.0 mpd for local spend and 2.0 mpd for overseas spend, that is superseded by non-fee cards such as the PrviMiles.   Bottom Line: If you are both a HSBC Premier client and a frequent traveller that can maximize the number of priority pass visits, limo and meet-and-assist services (and your supplementary cardholders are too), then this is the card for you. The reduced general mile earn rate is worth the trade-off for the unlimited priority pass memberships, as well as the high number of limo and meet-and-assist services that you can use. "
1,"So-so card for air miles.  However HSBC cards have one good benefit in which they are able to purchase discounted Golden Village movie tickets at a rate far better than any other bank's credit cards or rebates. This is the only plus point of this HSBC credit card.  Otherwise, this card is a hit and run for me. Sign up for only its sign up gift (and perhaps for discounted GV tickets)"
5,Prompt in reply to email enquiries and online renewal application. Online account management is easy to use. Highly recommended! 
5,I had first decided to take up iswitch when it started launching in Jurong. Their promo is the attractive at that point of time. Fast response from them and solving my problem immediately. Good customer service. They had also given me alternative and suggestion on my problem.   Thank you so much!
4,"I was comparing all the Fixed Rate (24mths plan) across all retailers when it started to open up to the area in Jurong and found iSwitch to have the most competitive plan. The application was smooth and easy. Their service staffs were very attentive to your enquires. The staffs are very flexible in their approach. Billing was e-statements which were sent to my email promptly.  So far, so good! Have not encountered any issues thus far. "
5,"Very good customer service, the person handling my questions is very patience and know what to propose to me on the queries i have."
5,It was easy to sign up. The customer service agent was friendly and helpful. 
4,"I was comparing all the Fixed Rate (24mths plan) across all retailers back in Jul/Aug 2018 and found iSwitch to have the most competitive plan. The application was smooth and easy. Billing was e-statements which was sent to my email promptly. They do allow credit card payments thru their website (whether this would earn points/cashback/miles is dependent on the credit card i guess). So far, so good! Have not encountered any issues thus far. "
1,"I would give it a zero star if there was one. The customer service was horrible and the advertising was misleading, intentionally leaving out the monthly service fees from the published rate only to hide it in the fine prints. Why is there a need to hide this if the company is transparent. I also dare not leave my one-month deposit with them (remember the shared bicycles?). They will charge you $100 when you realize about the service fees and want to cancel even on the same day. It is unfair to the elderly and less privileged. I really hope the authorities will step-in because we don't need such companies preying and lurking among us in a market that is supposed to be transparent and fair competition."
1,"Extremely horrible experience with the sales staff.  When the consumer didn't furnished the staff with the Utility account number even the Sms reminder is sent to consumer. That's mean the consumer is still considering, he/she may not wish to sign up with them. However  a confirmation of sign-up is received via SMS and threatening consumer that termination fee will be enforced if he/she cancel the sign-up.  This is a most Forceful/Evil selling technique/attitude that I ever encountered for my 59 years on earth."
5,"The best price in town, coupled with fuss free signing. These are the most important factors to any consumers. Thumbsup!"
5,"Good service through out account changing, new meter installation and billing. Their customer services officer are very resourceful and all the infos you need are at their finger tip. Recommended for others to use their service. "
5,"I've signed up with Iswitch since March and have saved significant amount per month. My giro payment mode activated before my first bill is out. Iswitch provides fast, efficient and friendly service as always. "
5,Competitive pricing + hassle-free & seamless experience! Commendable efforts for promptness in assisting me with my queries - Thank You Alvin Tan! =)
5,"Unrefusable rates, quality service, ideal value added services and other package compliments. Most essentially, a team that truly cares.   Thank you iSwitch.    "
5,"Easy to switch online, the process was surprisingly quick! Wanted to check on the payment options so I sent a message on facebook and got a reply straight away! "
1,Hidden cost? Service fee: $4.95 per month (Exc. GST); $5.297 per month (Inc. GST)  Only notice this after comparing a few. Did not think that it will hide it cost like this unlike other electrical provider.
1,"Worst company. Misleading with clauses that are obviously out to take advantage of the consumer. Rate will return to 5% when consumer continues plan, and they purposely left out the option not to auto renew contact. The onus is own your own to chase them to change plan or change to another subscription from another provider. If you will be stuck for another 2-3 years, and force to pay termination fees if you find out when it is too late."
1,"Totally unethical, i signed up at first thinking it was the cheapest and decided for a 2 years contract! However found out that there is a monthly service fee of $5.  And if i would to terminate now it would cost me $100."
1,"At first I thought it was the cheapest rate. Yet there's a monthly fee that was hidden in the fact sheet page 2 section C last line:   ""Service fee: $4.95 per month (Exc. GST); $5.297 per month (Inc. GST)""  Add up this fee will make it cost more than all other brand.   Most people don't know because it's not obvious in their website and they purposely hide it in fact sheet one small section only.   So don't ever get from this company. They are not transparent about the true cost.  So which one is best or most transparent of their price ? Read my review and choice here : https://seedly.sg/reviews/electricity-market/ohm-electricity?rid=3232#reviews&utm_source=review_share&utm_medium=internal"
1,"I haven't even started to use ISwitch and already have a bad impression of them.  One of the sales reps at the booth signed us up saying we would take advantage of a 30% promotion.  We get a call from customer service a few weeks later saying your region does not have coverage and even if it does by May , we can't provide the promotion by then.  This company doesn't even know where its coverage is, misled us, and then actually has the nerve to not even give us the promotion.  This is very typical of Singapore's poor customer service. If they cared about their customer, they would apologise for their mistake and offer the promotion when it comes to our region."
4,Is there a plan which helps us more savings to take.I have a plan to sign up.Please sugest.  What makes benefit when switch your electricity from SP to Iswitch?  Since SP is the main power supplies- How there is a cost saving in Iswitch.
1,"when i was about to apply,, i talk in their 2 different agents to make sure the early termination due to relocation in or out of singapore,,.  both of them showed me a contract from their Tablets,, that i can do early termination due to relocation without penalty as long i need to show some documents..   but when i received the contract,, they OPT that clause..   and now,, even transferring the account to the new owner of the premisses,, they said Early Termination Costs may apply depending on your contract."
5,Competitive price and online portal is easy to use. Happy to renew contract for anther 24 months. Done so for my the other contract too.
4,"Smooth transition from SP Power to them, but I hope they would reply to some queries at a quicker pace. But any OEM retailer is more enticing than SP! "
5,"Signed up with iSwitch today after comparing between Keppel Electric, Geneco, Ohm and Tuas Power!!!!!!!!!!!!!  "
5,Overall Fast process to apply. Saving about 30% of the electricity bill. Recommend this service provider 
1,My bills aren't necessarily lower than usual before the switch so I think consumers should do more homework on which company they want to sign up for. 
5,"It was very simple and easy to sign up my account with I Switch online. I enjoyed huge savings on my electricity bills and have a very positive experience with I Switch. Have recommended a few friends to sign up with I Switch and so far, they are happy with my recommendations."
5,"The electricity market can be quite daunting at first especially there are so many to compare. In my opinion, the friendliness of the sales staff and their patience is the most important, and for that I Switch is fantastic! Highly recommended!   "
5,"I chosed ""Chope"" the Rate 24 month plan. Pretty reanable, saved a lot of money especially SP rate raised again this quater. Feel like this plan saved more than the Super Save Discount plan."
5,I have switched for 3-4 months already. No hassle so far and the rates are good! The self service portal or app is very simple to use. Supports recurring card payment or Giro too. :)
5,"iSwitch has helped me to have significant savings in my monthly electricity bills. Everybody should switch to iSwitch and not stay with SP Services regulated tariff rate that is expensive with no discount at all. iSwitch has e-billing, they email and send SMS to me, informing me that my bills are ready. I  could even login to their customer service portal and mobile app to view my bills and pay online with credit cards. Their available payment options includes AXS (Kiosk stations, mobile app, portal) , GIRO and recurring credit card with POSB Everyday card giving 1% cash rebate and up to 5% rebate for using UOB One card. iSwitch is my Electricity retailer of choice for sure! Kudos to iSwitch team!"
5,"The pricing is very good and cheapest in the market. But at first when I start my contract, i was not able to register for online portal. Keep pressing forget password but didn‚Äôt send email to me. Then I sent email to customer service. A staff kevin tell me need to have online presence then can login. Then I realised I didn‚Äôt register for an account that‚Äôs why haha! Very fast response time from customer service team. Keep it up guys!! I will recommend more friends and family to iSwitch! "
5,I like how they are the largest green retailer in singapore. Their prices and customer service is good as well.
5,"To be honest, reaching them via their hotline is a challenge as they are so very popular in the market. However, my frustration was eventually enveloped by their warm and down to earth customer service. Customer service is often lacking in Singapore so am very pleasantly surprised by their welcoming and sincere approach. There was this officer called Uni that sounded very hyper and energetic. Thank you for resolving my matter! Thumbs up! :)"
5,"Made the switch earlier on. The breakdown of the plans were explained clearly to me, including the service fees, early termination formula & cancellation charges. Made the switch then, and never looked back"
5,Excellent customer service team and fuss free payment modes!! queries promptly responded to!! will definitely recommend to my friends!!!
5,Quick and easy sign up process... Best rate in town and save almost 50% of my utility bill monthly..
5,I chose iSwitch for my home plan after reviewing the prices where iSwitch offered the best rates. Their customer service was very helpful when answering questions as well. Would definitely recommend to my friends  
5,"Signed up with iSwitch for my home electricity plan and have never looked back since. Best decision ever made. Awesome Customer Service Team, very responsive and with dedicated personnel to attend to all my queries! Keep up the good work!"
5,"Friendly agents, friendly customer service staff. Excellent prices as well! Fuss free correspondence via email and sms. Props to iSwitch for saving the Earth!"
5,"Did some research and got myself the plan with service fee. Cust svc was very upfront about the fees,not a exactly a hidden charge that some of the other reviews implies. Plus, the $5.00 fee becomes negliable for larger consumer like me and rates actually do work out to be the lowest in singapore.  Then there is the free aircon service and insurance. Aircon was helpful. Dont care much for the insurance though. Still, free stuff is never a bad thing. "
5,I signed up for my home plan thru iSwitch. I got the best price and savings in town. I get to pay thru my credit card and get cash back rebates too.
5,"With all the options out there, iSwitch made it easiest for me to switch. Great savings and perks!  Most valuable though, since I am renting my place, iSwitch gave me the peace of mind knowing that i can transfer my account to another home if I were to move at a waived cost. "
5,The iswitch team has been fantastic. The switch was quick and simple and now I'm saving heaps on my electricity bill.
5,Cheapest rates in the market with great free stuff and local customer service.  Also green energy instead of polluting Genco.
5,"The switch is hassle-free and their self-service app is easy to use too! Not only you will get the best saving, but also saving the environment as well. 10/10 would recommend."
5,"Changed my electricity plan earlier this year and I would definitely recommend all to do so, have already referred few of my family & friends to sign up with iSwitch as their referral rate is quite attractive. Signing up was fuss-free and as easy as ABC. The agents were also very helpful and knowledgeable! "
5,"Is important to note iSwitch purchases UN certified carbon credits when you sign up online, lets all contribute to a sustainable future."
5,Easy to switch. Customer service very helpful in changing payment method. Savings are worth the switch. Recommend. 
1,Please have a rating for 0 star. my bill is even more expensive the SP after the swap. thanks to the 'admin fee' I'll mark the date and be sure to jump out when the contract ends. Dont get con guys!
1,How do I receive my benefits after signing up? I try to contact the sales peronale but he doesn't even reply. So unprofessional!
5,Customer service shows great patience and provides instant assistance when making query on the online portal. Overall experience is good.
5,I like the service and also the price is  most competitive plan to me.  The customer service is very friendly and prompt response for any enquiries. I will give 5 BIG STAR to I SWITCH.

5,Hassle free experience and platform is user-friendly. Staff is very prompt to enquiries and feedback . Thumbs up.
5,Their price is competitive but most importantly the service and whole process was seamless and hasslefree. They answered my questions very patiently as well. Appreciate :)
5,"Love the ipromo plan! We get upfront savings of 400++ which is the price of the iPad and discount on electricity bill on a monthly basis, I think it‚Äôs a pretty sweet deal if you are looking for cool gadget give always. I would definitely recommend this plan to my friends and family.  "
5,Kristal is a great platform and well managed. They adapt well to the market and as a result manage to balance portfolios very well. I would definitely recommend Kristal. 
5,"Kristal.AI is highly professional. They prove that results speak louder than promises. Personally, for me, it has been the best experience for investment of my hard-earned savings! Well done Kristal team! Keep it up! "
5,"A very innovative and simple way to manage what seems like complex investment strategies.  Easy for a novice like myself to start investing in bonds and ETFs with no experience and no existing trading accounts.  The Kristal concept is great, it transparently shows you what your bundled investment unit is made up of how it is performing and you choose which ones to try out and can change them at anytime. Low to no fees, no creepy 'Financial advisors', just smart facts, figures, simplicity and full control. Great for beginners and experts alike!"
5,"Very easy to use, low fees and EXCELENT customer service. You can select yourself between the available ETFs or let their Roboadvisor AI to propose a ETF package based on your targets and risks you are willing to take. Highly recommended! "
4,Strong network and was connected to the local roaming data provider within a minute. Hope it can support countries in the near future.
5,"Used to be on a singtel 2 year contract plan, switched to circle, and went back to GOMO Singtel.   Usage Behaviour 1. Mostly Chat and Consume Instagram (Stories / Post) 2. Some Games (Daily 30 mins - 1 hr) 3. Youtube videos (1 hr daily) 4. Sometimes use as a hotspot (around 5 hrs per month), even to watch video ; )  Reason because  - it is one of the cheapest - $20 (no bullshit additional charges) - fits my usage - 10G B a month - 95% Network availability as compared to circles where the availability is much lesser - Speed is much faster than Circles   Improvements: 1. On the overseas plan, I think $10 for 3GB for 10 days is ok.  However, most of the time i dont travel too long especially for business trip. If it can be by day basis, eg $2 perday it will be much better.   2. Also there's certain countries not available yet like VN.  Sometimes network stability in other countries like TH is not so stable.    "
5,"Pros: - Data, calls and sms are more than enough. I don't need to start finding wifi here and there, not even at home, nothing to worry. - Visiting abroad on short trip is hassel free, Top up for $10 is super smooth and you are online without worry. - $20 with taxes is pretty reasonable. - You get Singtel connectivity which is best in class. - Web-interface is quite good. - Auto top up is a good option, better than remembering to pay bill every month.  Cons: - This is still a pre-paid, not for you if you wanna a post-paid.  Recommended if you are  - online always, socially active,  - watch movies online occassionally and listen to the music.  - not enough for online gamers."
5,"$20 for 20GB per month, with the same network coverage as a Singtel mobile customer. Worth it! Application was hassle free!"
5,"Amazing plan! Network connection is stable, and it provides me with more than enough data allowance (20GB). I also like that Caller ID is free, cuz it might not be so across all telcos. Sign up was easy, and delivery was free. Would definitely recommend this to friends."
3,"i have tried GOMO and GIGA while i was a current Circles.Life user.  I did not mind paying $30/month for CL as it had quality roaming options.  Also it had a loyalty bonus, but sadly what made me left was that they discontinued it and thus i can't justify paying more (than GOMO or GIGA) for the lesser data. Back to GOMO, i ended up settling with GIGA which cost $5 more per month just because of the app. I have to switch off wifi every single time, which was frustrating."
5,"Ported over from Singtel and it took a few hours (take note that porting from other Telcos will be longer up to 4 days)   Upon delivery (2pm), used my existing SIM card until it was de-activated around 5pm. Switched SIM Cards then and it was activated around 10pm later (had to restart my phone, so perhaps it was earlier)   Other than the downtime in between the porting, felt no difference (Network operator shows Singtel also) so everything is good :)   Totally recommend for value & cost-effectiveness. ($20 per month is awesome!) I would say M1's $25 plan for 30GB is the next best thing as there are some flexible options for travellers but I personally don't need that extra data and I hardly travel :( "
5,Offers the best value for one's monies. Monthly 20GB data + 200 mins talktime + 200 SMSes for S$20.00 p/m; aptly and adequately. A happy Patron.
4,"Switched to Gomo from M1:  Overall : Good!   1. 4G connections and speed indeed better than the rest of telco!  2. Price is good, no frills. Plan details also sufficient abeit not the best package offer in the market currrently. 3. Of course no frills means don't expect much, the apps written is like from a beginner, just personal details and account usage. Nothing else! Go see Circle life app, you'll find a kindergarden vs PHD.   My guess is they just gonna keep it lean, not gonna maintain much resources to take care of this new MNVO for reason known :) "
5,"Gomo is not-surprisingly good as it rides on the Singtel network and I am not regretting the decision! I was on starhub no contract plan ($25) 3 months in and decided to switch to Gomo to save that $5 more! the only drawback is that I am not reachable overseas as it does not support roaming (I think) but we usually have data overseas, so not an issue for me. "
4,"i switched to Gomo in July 19. Highlights: - SingTel network, coverage and quality is pretty good; - Competitive price; - Seamless port over; Lowlights: - I don't know what else I can do with the mobile app other than checking data balance. Learn something from Circles please..."
3,Application and delivery of sim was easy and smoothly handled. Network coverage not good at some places like basements. 
1,"This is the worse travel SIM card I have. I have no network most of the time and trying to hard to connect everyday in Japan. And I can‚Äôt even find a real human to speak with to solve my problem now!  My husband and I travel together, what are the chances that we take turn not to have network? He can have 4G and I have no network? I don‚Äôt get it!   "
4,"Pros: - $20 no frills. Comes with more than enough data, minutes and text for the average user without having to worry about contract plan. - Service is decent, hardly much problems with the coverage - Easy to change over, done in less than 2 days. - New roaming service is useful. - Still the cheapest plan other than first year for circles at $18.   Cons: - App is bare basic, limited features.  Recommended if you dont need that much data. Giga has rollover but its still 5 dollars a month more."
1,"I tried to order a sim card from GOMO service. So it was a mistake that cost me 20$. So after I proceed my payment via my bank and successfully sent money to them, I didn't get any confirmation or something else.  Support said that I can wait 3-4 weeks for refund.  So I decided to try another sim card and I hope I will get my money back."
1,"GOMO is cheap, but the service is super poor. Don't go to apply for gomo anymore, otherwise your cancellation request is a nightmare. Two months, three different customer service promised to cancel subscripiton, but they just came to appease you, the money is monthly deducted, all are perfunctory."
3,It‚Äôs quite a good plan for student or new to workplace adult as it really cheap and affordable plan.
5,After staying with M1 for more then 10years finally decided to transfer to another telco as M1 base plan @ $25 + $5 for caller id is expensive for my usage of 10gb/month.   Decided to transfer to Gomo after using seedly sim-only comparison tool and signed up with Gomo on Wed. Simcard was delivered on Thursday and i also did a transfer of ownership on Thursday. Received sms that port-in was schedule on Sat 2am.  Overall take around 4 days from signup till service port-in and activated. i was expecting the port-in to fail as i had just transfer the ownership of the phoneline to myself just a day before so was kinda surprise that it went thru.   I'm expecting service/signal quality to be good compare to M1 as i travel to work on purple line. M1 reception is very bad in the purple line tunnel with frequent disconnection. 
5,"I've been using GOMO for the past 7-8 months now and I've had no problems with it. The coverage by Singtel has been solid thus far, previously when I was under M1, I had issues with connectivity in the MRT but now I no longer encounter that. Also, for the cost of $20 per month, where I normally only use data and not really use the calling feature, it's been a great plan for me thus far. It really depends on the usage of each user."
5,"I have use GOMO for 3 months now and I love it. The port in took less than a week. The plan is really simple, just 20 dollars for 20GB. If you need more then top up $10 for 10GB. "
2,Was initially with Starhub but moved over to M1 for the family plan (Multi-Service Saver) but mad regrets because it has such poor connection... and I only have 6gb a month üò≠
5,M1's 100GB tourist card is one of the best to use. Connection is stable and data is generous. Recommended to every visiting friend in Singapore.
5,"Only posting here because the latest 30 GB plan is lit. But, connection is somehow still not as strong as Singtel & Starhub. "
2,"Network connection isn't 100% reliable. Generally, lots of hidden fees and plans are very expensive. Bills usually come in with higher payments than expected. "
3,Pros: - competitive price - data mostly 4G than 3G in most area - Free calls for 3 X M1 number of family and friends saves a lot for calling love one  Cons: - No data connection 2 to 3 stations up and down Serangoon MRT (REALLY BAD!!!) -  not much rewards  - rigid on recontract of data Sim that comes with Fibre broadband(must show original IC)   Overall OK. 
5,"I have been using a mobile line from M1 since year 2002 .  M1 has recently launched a new SIM-only no-contract plan that costs $25 per month and comes with: - 30GB mobile data - 1000 minutes of outgoing calls - free incoming calls - 1000 SMSes - unlimited free calls to 3 M1 numbers - unlimited music streaming on Spotify  Pros: - Generous amount of mobile data, talk-time and SMSes for that price. - Can appoint family members' mobile lines for the free calls to 3 M1 numbers  Cons - Need to pay additional $5.35 per month for Caller Number Display after the free 3-month/6-month promotion. - No use of Spotify  Overall, I would still stick to M1 with this new SIM-only plan, as I like the option of subscribing to Data Passport that allows using of mobile data overseas without having to change SIM Card and without having to incur higher data charges."
4,"Used M1 for a decade, switched my whole family into M1 and joined the Multi Saver plan. Save quite a lot of money!  https://www.m1.com.sg/personal/bundles%20and%20promotions/bundlesstatic"
4,"I'm on their old data-only 12-months plan, $20 for 5GB+10GB data, 100+800 outgoing minutes and 100 SMS.  Pro 1: Cheap price Current plans may seem more worth it (1GB for $1, for example) but to me, this is the best deal I can get because 15GB is way more than sufficient for my use. I rather save the $5 per month than spend it on data that I know I won't be using.  Pro 2: Loyalty is rewarded Unlike other brands, M1 has some form of benefits if you're loyal. You can appoint up to 3 M1 numbers where you can make unlimited free outgoing calls to. This is great for families and couples who love talking on the phone. Some ""Sun points"" are awarded, which you can accumulate to offset your bills at some point of time.  Pro 3: Data Passport Generally cheaper to pay and use data passport for first world countries. And it's a good-to-have option.  Pro 4: Cheapest supplementary plan I've gotten my mom the supplementary plan, meaning she shares my data, call minutes and SMS. It's cheaper than what other telco offers and I know, people say that just a few more dollars, she can have a plan on her own. But hey, a dollar is a dollar. Over 12 months, that's $12, let alone some savings of $36 here.  Con 1: Disrupted network The 4G network is generally smooth and good although there are some specks of weak data spots here and there, even when above ground. This is something I can never fathom how it can still happen when Singapore is so small and our data network should have been ironed out well even during 3G days.  Con 2: Loyalty is rewarded BUT could be better It's good that they award ""Sun points"" but you'll probably also realise that they're almost non-existent. It takes forever to accumulate them into something useful so in a way, this is a useless benefit unless you're on an expensive plan or have the entire family using M1 plans under your name (i.e. on the same bill)."
5,"I ported over from Zero1 to M1. They have introduced bigger data plans prior to the entry of the Singapore fourth telco, TPG. In addition, they offered free caller ID, waived off the registration fee & SIM card fees.  I have chose to sign up for the mySIM(3) 20 plan with 12 months contract. This plan is only $20, with 5GB data + 10 GB data (for 12 months). They have recently introduced this similar plan (3GB + 12GB) without contract. I feel that this is the most value for money plan for me at the moment.  I would definitely recommend everyone to use it! "
4,"Overall, it is good but there is one very important downside to this. Sometimes, especially around the town area, reception is very bad and will lose the signal. This only happens for people using M1 as their mobile provider. This also only happens for M1 as another person standing beside me using Singtel or Starhub can have full signal while I have zero."
3,"Was with M1 for 4 years before switching out to Starhub. The main reason I switched out was probably the same as others, that there isn't enough data and M1 doesn't really have a loyalty programme. They're relatively cheap though, just that I was forever struggling with my 3GB of data (Upsized it to 5GB but still struggle).  There're some issues accessing data underground (esp on MRT trains), as with Starhub though. "
4,I was on circles when m1 got onto the sim only price war. So I got the one year contract. Circles was slow to react. So far so good. More than enough data. Only complaint is that 4g is not available at aljunied mrt area. Also it'll be good if m1 introduces roaming passports like other telcos.
4,"Plan: Lite+ (Student plan)  As my family uses M1 too, I am able to get a significant discount on my plan so it is worth it if most of our family members are using M1 too.  Pros: - Connection is quite stable - Customer Service is relatively efficient - The M1 app can be used to do a variety of things such as checking your billing, data usage and it is easy to use!  Cons: - Connection can be quite weak and unstable underground, especially when in the MRT, at certain stations"
5,"I have been using this telco for quite a while and changed it at first due to the corporate discount that I have and it happened to be the most value for money. But came to realise that there are actually other good points about this telco that I would like to recommend.  On a whole, I'm glad I changed to this telco because of the good customer service and reliability. The transfer from one telco to M1 was seamless and I had no cut off in my network which was great because it would have been troublesome to be without my phone line.  Secondly, would like to praise the customer service for being fast and helpful. There were times in the past years that I have i) lost my sim card and ii) needed help with network overseas that I needed to call in to the customer service and they have been nothing short of helpful. Even overseas, they manage to waive my overseas call charges to them.  I have since also changed my mum's line to be under my name to enjoy corporate discounts and even the transfer for that was smooth and seamless. I love love love the service given by M1. Oh, not to forget the free 3 M1 numbers I can call to for free - this is so my mum and I can talk all day long (or rather for me to hear her nag all day)  Also, it's useful to have the M1 app on my phone because I can apply for data roaming on the app instantly and have it approved a few minutes later. It's good for me to have live tracking of my data usage, message usage and call minutes usage as well. It is useful for me to ration till the next billing cycle!  The only qualm I can think of would probably be the weak signal when I'm in the train when passing by underground stations such as those on the Circle Line, but that is a small issue for me since I can just listen to music and not scroll through facebook/ instagram/ twitter. "
5,"Best value for money now at $25 for 30GB. Plus Data Passport and Free Weekend calls and Free Caller ID. PLUS they removed and allowed me to change my existing plan even though I am in a 12-month contract! Wow!  M1 Broadband also has the best deal at $39.90 with free Google Home Mini. The mobile salesperson even came to my void deck to complete the deal, no queuing required!  However, M1 definitely has slightly lower reception in MRT trains."
4,Used M1 for around 8 years. Still using the old iPhone plan 12GB of Data and years ago they give free upgrade for existing users 3G to 4G. But till now still using 3G unless at some places 3G Internet connection is slow will try using 4G. Good thing about M1 is they give discounts of total bill if you have few lines with m1&internet. 
4,"Been using M1 since long long time ago. The signal are generally fine except for some stretch of North East Line, the trick is to turn off 4G and switch to 3G. Recently re-contract to SIM-only plan, 5GB of data per month at just $20 which is one of the most affordable one.  One of the downside is that the data passport for China cannot surf Google, Facebook, etc. It used to work fine when I was in China in Sep 2017. Had to use VPN."
3,"Used M1 many years ago, and no issues with this telco, but as I enjoy the TV channels on StarHub hence switched my mobile plans to StarHub. "
5,"Has been a loyal M1 user, love its customer service and no billing issue so far. Was with another telco which double charge when I transfer line to under my name (charge my friend and charge myself for the same month). "
4,Been using M1 for the past 15 years and the customer service is wayyyy better than Singtel. My family is on the MSS plan (the old scheme which give us 30% for 4 member).   Using M1 Citibank credit card and NTUC member gives us additional promo during sign up.   Better loyalty retention as compared to Singtel too.  
5,"Been using M1 since forever. I am on the multisaver plan, where you get savings when you use their broadband + mobile lines.  Their customer service is one of the best around and very friendly staff. Recently went to recontract and the staff informed me of the NTUC member promo which gives 10% off mobile bill, extra 1gb, roaming and free caller ID!!   SIgned up their mySIM Plan and after discount only $18 a month! very cheap!  "
5,Using the One plan. $25 for a 30gb plan is really good! Bonus for M1 is the data passport that helps you save money on overseas data! 
5,Very competitive due to the recent changes of Choosing your own plan based on your needs. Coverage is ok without any much complain. 
3,The plans are not so much fantastic. Staffs are ok in service. But plans are too pricey. Customer service are ok. Not much free gift products. The points redeemtion are limited. 
3,Network connection can be better. Like inside mrt and underpass(tunnel) the reception can be better cause I always lost connection. 
5,use for so many yrs International Calls | M1 Why should international calls be expensive? It's a small world after all. Get the best international calling deals with our IDD Rates and
4,Have been using M1 for a long time and has always been satisfied with their service and internet speed. Keep it up!
4,"The connection quite ok, however some area are restricted with internet access, probably recommend people to sign up corporate plan with M1 cause is much cheaper then other company"
3,"Just signed up M1 a couple of months ago, however their connection is always weak, especially during the weekends."
5,I used m1 as my wifi provider I think that the connection is quite stable. I hope the connection can stay as stable as possible 
5,I've been M1 loyal customer for more than 15 yrs. Happy with it so far. No plans to change telcos anytime soon
1,"Prepaid on m1 is bad, my credit will went missing suddenly after top up. Customer service did not follow up on case, and sometimes unstable "
3,m1 fibre broadband has frequent outages even on wired connection. wordlimitwordlimitwordlimitwordlimit
5,Having M1 Broadband at my home now. And totally no significant issues in the 3 years we using this.  Didn't even have any chance to talk to customer service officers before. I saved them tons of customer service officer fees... they shld give me a voucher. lol to be frank I think they deserve a good 5 stars
5,"I have been using M1 plans for several years now. Currently under MySim plan. * 30 GB with additional 15GB data (45GB in total) * can add $12 to one more sim and share the data, phone, and SMS, which I think nice value when you can share it with your family member Overall, it has been a pleasant experience with M1 mobile plan"
5,"I have been with M1 for over 20 years and still they are the best for me, always giving the best under the Sun, I am extremely pleased and happy to be their customer"
5,"Absolutely best customer service as compared to 2 previous telcos I've tried. Been with them for more than 10yrs since. On top of that, best corporate plan!"
4,Ported over in July 19 for the Sim only plan  Pros  - porting experience was fast and simple  - 30 GB data ! - Free Spotify streaming  - free weekend data for 6 months(promo)  - free call ID (why did SingTel charge me so much)  - free calls to 3 m1 numbers  - 1000 mins  - 1000 sms  - tried the Facebook messenger chat and it was quite a good customer experience   Cons  - had to pay for SIM card - coverage in some areas might not be as good as SingTel   Overall I am a happy customer ! 
5,Have been using M1 since more than 10 years ago. Always provide the most competitive price plan for me and best customer service. I am also using their fibre broadband service with free digital voice under the same bill. Excellent telco.
5,"my family is using M1 mobile, the outdoor and indoor signal is good every where. for 2 M1 mobile, the monthly bill is just $36 which is quite low."
5," APPLICATION?  Application process via online is relatively easy. M1 offers Plan with Device and SIM-only plan (no contract and entirely customisable). Free delivery for online sign-up and for re-contract. Beating the queue in advance*   ADDITIONAL SIM?‚Ä® Thinking of getting additional sim for work related or for someone else? In addition, M1 provides free caller number display for 3 months for new sign-ups or, enjoy free 6 months if you switch to M1. Do you smell the goodness like i do ?    CONNECTION STRENGTH? Undoubtedly, this telco connection impressed me. Whilst travelling regardless of in tunnel or at camp sites, there isn‚Äôt a significant drop in the connection signal as compared to my previous telco (not pointing fingers). Ragnarok M definitely require good connection signal at all times for MVP hunt.   PRICE (Plan with Device)? Other than the above mentioned. Plan with Device for $30/month, I gotten 12GB data/month with FREE incoming calls, Unlimited FREE calls to 3x M1 numbers and UNLIMITED music streaming on spotify.  PRICE (SIM-only plan)? For the SIM-only plan at $25/month, I gotten 30GB data/month with FREE incoming calls, Unlimited FREE calls to 3x M1 numbers, UNLIMITED music streaming on spotify AND contract free. Personally, I feel that M1‚Äôs SIM-only plan is the best out of all the telco so far. "
5,3 of my family members are using M1. They love it for it's reliable service and competitve pricing. I've noticed that the SIM-only plans are highly affordable and am considering to switch over to the M1 SIM-only plan after my contract is up with Starhub. 
4,I am a user of the M1 Sim only plan paying $25 a month. This plan is the most value for money and service is not too bad as well although coverage is slightly worse than Singtel.
3,"Been using M1 for more than a decade before the raise of MVNO. Customer Serivce is responsive and coverage is good. Price is considered on the higher side due to price slashing of the entire sector. Wont recontract anymore, switching to MVNO. "
5,Great discounts and user friendly mobile app. Ease of adding on roaming or other services as and when required.
1,Connectivity has been degrading consistently till now sometimes i barely get any connectivity even when it shows 4G. Going to port over my number
4,Had been using M1 and found especially useful when traveling around the region for work and play.  The data passport worked well and  instant start stop via MyM1 served especially. 
4,"One of the best mix and match plans around,network is also good and stable and can call free to 3 M1 users makes it even better."
5,"Mine is a ~$70 plan with 36GB Data... think its 15 GB then give 20 GB free PLUS 1GB for some other reason... can't complain every month maximum I use about 10 GB.  The data passport very useful, just add $10 every month for usage in Malaysia. Went Thailand during June Holidays and added $10 to use."
1,"I received the worst customer service on record from this firm. After using them extensively for 4 years, they sent me a bill of over 1000 SGD due to data roaming charges even though I had network lock enabled. Turns out that if you are in a country without partner network, the network lock won't prevent you from connecting to networks M1 doesn't partner with. What's more, the information on the M1 app is misleading and unclear. Also, the SMS that is meant to prevent you from incurring data charges of more than 100 dollars is also nonsense - I disabled data roaming immediately and my charge is 10 times more! To top it all, they don't want to waive those charges and they expect me to pay for their mistakes. I am switching to another provider. "
4,"Not the best service but cheapest. Been using it for 4 years. For contract renewal, usually waiver for early contract given after 1years, which mean every year you can change new phone if you want. "
5,"I‚Äôm loving the new no-contract plan because now I have 30GB per month for such an affordable price ($25). 1GB per day! Now I can watch Netflix anywhere, anytime "
5,New M1 one plans are very competitive and easily the cheapest option. Singtel and Starhub are more expensive.
4,"Had been using M1 for quite a number of years. No complaints so far in terms of coverage and service, except maybe in some MRTs. But with the new contract-less plans, it is a good value for money. Would recommend!"
4,"I've been using M1 because they have the cheapest price for the plan I need. They have a couple of policies for different purposes as well like the one I'm currently in: for those who uses whatsapp over the usual SMS,etc. Have a read through to see which one suits you best!  The only cons is that there's a lost of connection sometimes when you're in an underground MRT station (esp at City Hall and Raffles place)."
5,M1 is really good. Good Coverage. I been using it for 3 years. No problem for customer support and hassle free. 
1,"I'm using M1 now for a bit more than 3 months and I had a lot of problems with the provider. First of all the provided information system, when the data is almost gone no notifications are given. Also my money was fully gone of my account, went to the shop, then I needed to call a number, no service or whatsoever at the store. During my call I got information and could try it again, but they didn't correctly explain me how it worked, so I lost again my money. After 3 phone calls and one visit to the shop, I discovered my fault, but if someone told me earlier I would not lose my money twice. furthermore you can't keep the data not used on the previous month and today I had the problem that my data was expired, no problem I switched of my data, but all the money I still had on my account and was not used for anything was gone. To summarize bad services from the personnel and also no information about the status of the phone.  "
1,"M1 service used to be excellent. Now, the phone line takes very long to get through. My app does not allow you to redeem points. The helpline, after telling them the problem, insist that there is a problem with my phone. (This is the second phone I am using and the app still does not work).  After all the time I spent, I finally gave up and told them to redeem it by phone (I need to rush off by then) even though I knew it will need me additional points.  This guy actually told me that it couldn't be done. I had to mention TWICE that I just called another lady who told me about it. Only then did he agreed to it.   Why did he have to lie about it?"
3,"Ported over from M1 pre-paid to M1 post-paid. Plans are indeed good, prices are very fair and data passport rocks. But coverage and speed dropped dramatically shifting to post-paid and definitely feels inferior relative to Singtel/Starhub.   Great if you are on a budget but you get what you pay for."
5,"The best mobile plan ever. With data passport, it's a win for me. Period. However, I do believe their loyalty gifts can be better."
1,"Hi. I went to M1 Shop at Nex on 31 Dec 2018 to get my sim card replacement. It was 720pm and I was told that the waiting time would be 20mins. However, they did not allow  me to take the queue number because my father was not around as the line is under his name. Then, I went home and asked him to come down 30mins later. However, when we reach. The staffs in M1 told us that they are closing since 730pm. What on earth is going on?! If they were closing early, pls inform us in advance and dont say need wait 20mins. thanks. I hope to hear from you soon."
3,"Been on M1 since 2000 when I first got my Nokia 3210. Unfortunately they don't seem to reward loyal customers who stay with them, and I'll never forget the hoo-ha when I wanted to reserve the LG G4 with them to purchase at retail price, only to be told its only available for recontracting customers (had to get the phone from stinktel in the end). So my current contract with them will be the last, and I'll happily port over to my Republic come November to enjoy cheaper rates and more data. "
5,Mobile plan so far signal good. Nothing to complain. Quite stable. Just that mobiles that come with the plans are expensive. 
2,"Quite recently ‚Äúdivorced ‚Äú M1 after more than 10 years of being a loyal customer. I really didn‚Äôt want to change telcos because I was using it for so long already but their lack of customer service, additional service fees & high costs plus disregard for loyalty really put me off.  The only big plus for M1 is the overseas data passport which you can use your local data overseas for an application fee of $10++. As I was no longer under contract, I had couldn‚Äôt get the discount price to top-up data. I have to recontract and still pay $10+ application fee. On top of that my 3gb data plan with 120 min call time plus free sms costs me $45++ monthly. Which I always exceed the data and get charged $60++ monthly. Very expensive.  Despite being a loyal customer for over a decade, there was no loyalty benefit. No fee waiver offers.  Another plus point is the giro payments via CitiBank m1 card which gets $$$ rebates monthly. But that can be easily overtaken by charging my bill to other Cashback cards too.  The decision to ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù after 10 years relationship wasn‚Äôt easy but I‚Äôm glad I moved on to other telco as my bill is now less than  1/2 of the usual monthly fee. "
4,Been using m1 since forever maybe 15 years now. Currently my whole family except my brother who stuck to singtel is using it. Excellent customer service on the phone.. Don't have too many attitude problems and they are very patient.. Even when you see them in person at the shop ( i patronise the clementi branch ) was a sucker for the free m1 calls to 3 m1 numbers and it saved me a lot of money. On top of that still benefit from multi lines and corporate discounts. I can't rmb which discount i am on right now. Only con is that they downgraded my 12gb to x gb a long time ago without me knowing raaarrrrr. Connection when compared to star hub side by side is much better. Have considered switching before but can't find any plans that fits my needs and at this cost. Hope they give us more loyalty rewards hehehe. Also their old mysim plan gives others a run for their money. Not gonna recontract. They also have an app that does the basics for tracking purpose.   Cons: - not much loyalty scheme - rather rigid in terms of data. Would like the option to adhoc add data at $x like circleslife instead of charging me $10 for exceeding even 100mb üò†

5,"Great card for online purchases, 4 miles per dollar, which even men can apply. Up to 2k per month without minimum spending."
5,"It's a great miles card! Earn 4mpd on online purchases cap at 2k a month! Call them to set your billing cycle to calender month so it's easier to keep track of the 2k spend too! The DBS points can also be pooled together from other DBS cards like DBS altitude so less chance of orphan miles lying around. Although it says Min 80k salary per annum, however if you already have a current DBS credit card, just apply through ibanking and they will give it to you :) "
4,I recently added this card to my collection for the high earn rate and the constant in app/ online purchase that I do monthly.   Pros  1) 10X DBS Points (or 20 miles) per S$5 spent on online purchases 3X DBS Points (or 6 miles) per S$5 spent on overseas purchases  2) One of the best card for online and in app purchase.   3) world master perks   4) no min spend   5) Great if you have the DBS multiplier account for higher interest rates  Cons  1) bad general spending card at 1X DBS Point (or 2 miles) per S$5 spent on everything else  2) points counted at $5 blocks ! This might make you spend more money in the long run. If you are at $18 dollars how about spending another 2 dollars to earn that extra mile ?  3) high annual fees at S$192.60 (Principal Card) S$96.30 (each Supplementary Card)  4) moving goal post on spending exclusions. You have to check the crowd source xls to see if your spending is eligible for points 
4,One of the must have credit card if you are accumulating miles (Online spending = 4 miles per dollar).  The most annoying is the bonus points are not awarded in the same statement/transaction. They first give you basic points x1 DBS points while the remaining x9 points are awarded on the 15th of the next month for transactions on the previous month which makes tracking a chore! Not sure why there is a need to do that...
5,"Pros: 10x/4mpd for online spending. (Grab, Fave, and pretty much everything online) Useful to combo it with DBS Multiplier credit card spend for more % DBS Points pool  Cons: 10x/4mpd cap at $2k per calendar month, anything more that $2k will award 1x/0.4mpd Poor oversea spending point rate DBS points earned on this card will expire in 1yr  If you are into miles, this card is a must have in your team! If you can't put enough spend on this card within 1yr, you might want to checkout DBS Altitude. Don't let the S$80k and above per annum entry level requirement scare you, just apply for it! (Got it with only S$30k per annum salary). And Yes, man can also apply for this card!"
4,"Maybank Kim Eng used for a prefunded account to do my RSP.   Pros: 1. More counters for selection to do RSP 2. 1% sales charge for transaction below $1,000. 3. Units are notified via email when purchased on the 9th. As I prefer online statements compared to letters.   Cons: 1. Interface is pretty outdated and it took me sometime to navigate the site.  2. Need a min. of 100units to be able to sell.  3. There's sale charge when selling but insignificant for a low amount.  "
1,I signed up for their Monthly Investment Plan only for them to cancel it within 3 months. So now I'm saddled with odd number of shares that in order to sell them I have to put up with $10 commission fee each. This offer is only valid until December 2019 and should I hold them past the due date I will be charged $40! I have to write off all my counters on MIP. By far my worst ever investment.
4,"Signed up for a pre-funded account last year. Commission rate is low. Just a reminder, indicate an amount higher than $100 for MIP.  As indicated $100, your commission rate would be more than 1%.  For example, if you indicate $100 for a stock priced at $25. They would purchase 3 units for you as they take into consideration fees in that $100. The commission is a minimum $1, thus your commission rate is approx 1.33% instead of 1%.  With the same logic, try and accumulate at least $8500 stock value before the intention to sell."
4,Signed up for a prefunded account last year to start on their monthly investment programme. I'd say they have the widest range of stocks for selection to rsp into on a monthly basis. Their website is a bit old fashioned but workable enough. Just downloaded their app recently to start on margining some stocks and it's quite straightforward to use. Better than the other local broker app I used in the past and it allows fingerprint authentication to sign in. 
4,Signed up for Maybank Prefunded account during a roadshow and there was an on-going promotion whereby one can get 12 months of $0 commission for Monthly Investment Plan. Pretty good way to perform RSP as there's no cost (and no custodian fees charged too) 
5,"Just got it recently also for the promotional sign up bonus :)  Up to 38,000 miles for a signup.  But honestly, the realistic miles for sign up is between 27k miles.  How to get the 38,000 miles:  - 10,000 miles: Sign up (only new to bank credit card customers) - 10,000 miles: Pay annual fee of $192 - 18,000 miles: This one is based on $6,000 spending on 3mpd (mile per dollar) > But this is only for online travel/hotel spending  So realistically it is: 10k + 10k + 7.2k miles (based on $6k spend at 1.2mpd.  If you already have a DBS Credit card, you can only get 5,000 miles for sign up.  Still not bad for a sign up deal."
4,"I replaced DBS Live Fresh Card with this as I wanted a reward card and this gives a pretty decent miles for possible categories that i will spend in. While I do agree that its counterpart- DBS Women's World Card is better in gaining miles, I am not an avid online shopper and I can never match the income eligibility - it requires S$80,000 and above per annum (OAO). The next option will be DBS Women's Card but it gives less miles for booking of airline and hotel tickets. 2miles per $1 compared to DBS Altitude's 3miles per $1.  Other benefits: - Fuss free application (I got it around a week after I applied since I was current customer; I applied via Ibanking). - 10k complimentary miles for paying annual fee. Alternatively, you could spend just $25k per annum for a fee waiver.  - Complimentary global airport lounge access - Rewards do not expire (very important!!!). Great for people who are not big spenders and plan to accumulate their rewards. When DBS Live Fresh Card was still a reward card and I was using them, I had to keep redeeming the points within three months as they will expire - No minimum spend - Good combination with DBS Multiplier  Note: the travel insurance is definitely not worth mentioning as one of its benefits. - it requires you to charge the entire travel related expenses to this card and it only covers accidental death or permanent disability while travelling on the air, sea or land transport. So you will still have to buy your own travel insurance."
5,"A must have card for those playing the miles game. For those who have an account with POSB/DBS, getting the card is a breeze with iBanking.  Pros: Suitable for those starting out in the game and income not exceeding 50K per annum. Paying annual fee allows you to earn 10K miles 3mpd when paying for air fares and hotel booking Miles never expires! Which gives you flexibility and the ability to accumulate a lot of miles while not worrying too much about expiry dates.  Cons: 1.2mpd for general spend. Not the best way to accumulate miles"
4,One of the highest miles per dollar card. Use it together with the multiplier account to get higher interest
4,A useful general spend card and one of my go-to card when booking air tickets and hotels to earn extra miles. 
2,"DBS Altitude Visa Cardholders, Watch out !!  S$1=4miles on DBS Market place has monthly cap of $5000.  The DBS site does not mention it while it mentions monthly cap for S$1=3 miles on online flight & hotel transactions.  IT does not mention it in the Terms and conditions in the section.  I found out through the DBS help center.  Very misleading on the website........ I asked them to correct it by adding the monthly cap in the section a few weeks ago, but it has not been done.  Be aware. "
5,"Miles that don't expire, up to 6 miles per dollar on Expedia, definitely a must have card for any rookie miles chaser. The complimentary lounge excess is an icing on the cake. You can choose to waive annual fees or pay it for 10,000 miles. Definitely not a bad deal especially if you are looking to redeem for business class and above. Miles are awarded in dbs points and you can use them to offset your transactions or redeem for other rewards if you have orphan miles. "
1,"In the realm of miles card for credit cards, DBS altitude visa is not a very good option. For general spending, the UOB privi miles and Citibank cards are of a better option. and for overseas expenditure, again the UOB Privi Miles and citibank cards for (Airmiles) triumph over it. Even within DBS, DBS Women's card offer a better airmiles for spending ratio for travel expenditure such as online booking of Air flights and Hotel.  Only positive of this card is that miles do not expire"
5,"Given the low entry level for this card, I would give it 5 stars. Use it for all airplane tickets and hotel bookings online to maximise the miles earn. DBS points earned also do not expire so slowly but surely (for frugal spenders) u would be able to earn and redeem that dream destination using just miles! And some tax payments, and some 25 dollars DBS charges for points conversion to krisflyer miles.."
5,"I find this an easy, fuss-free credit card to use. I also have a Multiplier account, so its natural I'd choose to use a DBS card instead of applying for a different bank card. It helps that I spend enough on it annually to qualify for a fee waiver and that reward points don't expire. This allows me to accumulate my points to redeem the miles over a longer period of time than a year.  I have never used the complimentary global airport lounge access though."
4,"Very similar in benefits to citi's premiermiles card, right down to the miles conversion rate and annual priority pass. Gives 5000 points (equivalent to 10000 miles) if annual fee is paid and it doesn't expire. Great feature to accumulate miles for cheap alongside premiermiles "
5,"This card has to be one of the best card for a fresh grad who finds it hard to hit the minimum spending on other credit cards. Being a frugal person, I aim to spending only an X amount each month, which is lower than the minimum spending of most credit cards. The card needs no minimum spending, gives you free airport lounge access twice a year, and gives you miles for spending. Definitely one of the best cards for me!"
4,1.2mpd is not bad but my dbs points won't expire. 2 free lounge visits are awesome esp for transiting flights! 
4,good for air ticket and hotels purchase with 3 miles per dollar. My go to card for travel bookings. Recommended!
5,"One of the must have credit card if you are accumulating miles (Hotel/Flights booking = 3 miles per dollar).  Points that will never expire, use it when hotel/flights booking will exceed $2,000. Otherwise, use DBS Woman's World Card for 4 miles per dollar. "
4,"Good miles card for travelling especially booking hotels and flights 3 times the 1.2 miles per dollar. It also has good promotions with Expedia from time to time. If you pay the $192 annual fee you can enjoy 5000 miles, which is worth it. Good card I use when topping up petrol as well as it gives 14% off at Esso."
4,"A decent card with 1.2 miles per local dollar spent. Good for young working adults and those who want to have their first miles card. And on top of that, it comes with 2 complimentary lounge access per year. "
4,"Good entry level miles card for people who travel often or are chasing miles. You get 3mpd for online travel and hotel spend, and 2 priority passes a year to use at airport lounges around the world. If you are chasing miles, you can pay the annual fees of $192 for 10,000 krisflyer miles (which would be worth it if you are aiming for business or first class tickets, but not so if you are not into the miles game). However any other local spend is 1.2mpd, and it would be better to combine this card with another card for dining or shopping."
5,Perfect card with combination of dbs multiplier. Just spend and get point. And it does not need minimum spend. Do note that it got yearly fee of 192. 
5,"You get complimentary global airport lounge access. This is a benefit you don't even get from many more exclusive travel cards. As a cardholder you enjoy 2 complimentary visits to over 700 airport VIP lounges worldwide within each 12-month period of Priority Pass‚Ñ¢ Membership, regardless of the airline or the class you fly! You can get a bit Hao Lian with this privilege, because it isn't something everyone can easily get!"
4,"Not a bad general spend card. 1.2mpd/2mpd. Can be combined with DBS multiplier, $192 for 10k miles annually if you opt to.  Comes with 2 lounge visits yearly."
4,A good general spending card   Pros  1) no expiry to points  2) bonus points on certain spending like Kalingo 3) when coupled with the DBS multiplier account provides for a good all use general card   Cons 1) low rate of airlines earn at 1.2   Worth a look if you have existing DBS mutiplier account 
3,"Out of all the miles card, this one is most suitable for me, a low spender who will not be able to accumulate fast enough miles. There is no expiry of the points/miles.  Pros: Suitable for those who goes on trips twice a year or more. More miles are given for travel related expenses.  Miles never expires! Which gives you flexibility and the ability to accumulate a lot of miles while not worrying too much about expiry dates.  Cons: 1.2miles per dollar is not the highest. Need to pay additional for conversion  Depending on your spending, this could be the worst or the best card to use to accumulate miles"
1,"I applied in late Feb, so I probably got the worst of their changing T&Cs. At first I was upset and decided to switch all my money out (it was a principles thing; I felt cheated after going the extra mile to get GIRO/salary crediting done, etc).  Here's where it gets bad: When I tried to use their app to transfer my money out, I realised you can't add payees via your phone? So I used Safari and.. for some reason, the OTP would not work out. Sure. So I went down to the bank, and tapped the ""Transfer to other bank"" option, only to get an error message. Their branch officer reassured me that this was poor UX because even DBS wouldn't allow that, at which point I was distracted by why they would even put a button that doesn't work in their ATM.. but.. friends... pls remember that you can actually make inter bank transfers via the ATM.  All in all the worst experience ever. I haven't listed all the sordid details of their crappy app experience (inaccurate use of language and poor use of colour, resulting in a lot of efficiency and confusion). I think it's a blessing in disguise that my telco rejected my GIRO application (wrong account number filled), and Maybank rejected my credit card application (it's okay guys, the card proposition is good, but I value sanity over miles)."
5,This is especially good for if you prefer to earn miles from their credit card. I spend a minimum $500 monthly with Maybank Horizon Visa Signature Card and able to earn miles with 3% interest.  
5,"3% interest! Personally my account of choice over UOB ONE,  DBS multiplier etc. Need to meet 3 out of 9 conditions.  Just credit salary,  $500 spend on credit card and $300 GIRO payment every month ( I use GIRO for IRAS and Utilities). Also  possible to optimise further by combining with UOB ONE account for high spenders "
5,I have been using both OCBC 360 and SCB Bonus $saver but have switched from those to Maybank Saveup for several reasons: (1) the interest is attractive (up to 3%); (2) Maybank Platinum Visa card has no annual fee to deal it - big deal for me; (3) min. amount to be kept in the account is $1K versus $3K for the other 2; (4) no cheque book issued; (5) Debit mastercard & internet banking token is issued on the same day of account opening - that is so efficient! (6) i just need 1 giro transaction of at least $300 to hit one of the hurdles - this means i can leave the other giros for other hurdle savings account.  So if you haven't consider Maybank Saveup do give it a serious look.
5,"same here! We use Maybank SaveUp for their 3% interest - very competitive rate + $50k insurance! We also use it for savings and not so much for transactions, so I'm ok with the user interface & lack of ATMs. Plus, their Maybank Platinum Visa Card has no annual fee, provided there is at least 1 transaction every quarter, and gives 3.33% cashback on almost any category of $300 spending - fuss-free!  Agree that Maybank Saveup is really underrated, in fact, I had moved over from OCBC 360 to Maybank Saveup. For the same criteria Salary , Spending & GIRO: from 1.85% to 3% - straightforward decision ;)   For daily transactions we use UOB One (3.33%). We get good interest with this combi :)"
5,"My husband and I applied maybank saveup joint account as we have applied housing loan through maybank, with his salary crdeit and $300 giro bills we can enjoy up to 3% interest. I'm very happy with it so far. This maybank account meant for saving so much transaction done, thus I'm ok with their internet banking design. "
5,Good for newbies in investment - Help me understand my investment risk and select the most suitable portfolio for me.
5,"User friendly platform. Easy to navigate, understand the risk profile and suitable portfolio for individualsüëç"
3,"Writing review for both MoneyOwl and Endowus. Both are not going to get 5 stars for now and i am giving 3 stars to MoneyOwl for the time being:  1. User interface MoneyOwl interface is very minimal in a negative way because there is no way i can tell the trend of return, current return and long term projected return. Endowus has almost all the basic info you and i need from digital service like this. Personally, i can also observe ongoing enhancement (like renaming goal & changing portfolio) and subtle changes from Endowus but so far nothing from MoneyOwl. However, if you were to compare both MoneyOwl and Endowus with Stashaway, both platforms have a long way to go! I would say MoneyOwl investment interface feels very ""half-baked"" and Endowus needs to simplify the interface.   2. Processes Account opening - I have tried to open MoneyOwl account 3 times (for myself & family members) and all applications were processed in the next business day. I have also tried to open Endowus account 2 times too and the experience was mixed. An application that was submitted later got processed successfully within 3 business days but another application that was submitted 1 business day earlier missed the promised timeframe (indicated on the web). MoneyOwl definitely seems to be more efficient here.  Funding - All fund transfers for MoneyOwl's cash account (with iFast) were reflected in the account within 30mins but it takes 1-2 days to see your fund in Endowus's cash account (with UOB Kay Hian). Once again, MoneyOwl is definitely more efficient here. Not sure if it is a tech constraint at Endowus & UOB Kay Hian but personally, i really like the quick turnaround time from MoneyOwl.  Investment Order Execution - both MoneyOwl & Endowus take 3-4 business days to complete the order. A tie here.  Both MoneyOwl and Endowus are relatively new to many retail investors like me. Consistency and efficiency are really important to gain trust. i had the opportunity to go through the processes multiple times and i believe MoneyOwl performs here.  3. Fee It has been discussed extensively in this forum. MoneyOwl has been saying that it doesn't aim to be the cheapest and it is not a robo-advisor but a bionic platform that provides non-commission based advisors. Personally, it is true that you can reach out to MoneyOwl advisor easily but i must say that i didn't have any problem to speak to anyone from StashAway and Endowus too when i needed advice. So why the higher fee? :)  Comparing MoneyOwl & Endowus, Endowus is slightly cheaper and i like the fact that it offers tiered pricing scheme. I hope both companies can offer referral scheme soon! "
5,"I opened an account and funded it, also started a monthly standing instruction for funding.  Initially, there were some hiccups but the customer service provided was excellent. I sent in a query in the evening, and I got a call within the hour to clarify the issue and resolve it.   Funding instructions was clear on the website and very fast process with regular emails coming in to confirm the funding as well as the investment being made."
5,I have done switch from SP Group to Union Power. The signing up  with Union Power is very easy and efficient.   
5,"Underrated retailer, maybe lack of marketing effort and they don't do roadshow frequently. Signed up for their fixed price plan. The cheapest in the market for 2 years contract. My house also using their LPG gas cylinder. "
5,This is attractive as it offers the cheapest 2 yrs fixed plan among it's competitors after comparison
3,"This is a note of caution as I have had an experience that was not pleasant but a learnig experience. A few days ago, I went online to the trading platform and clicked on spdr gold shares and clicked cpf as mode of payment then clicked the button buy. As only 10% of investible savings can be invested in gold etf, i was called one fine day and told that the cpf board had revoked that trade and cash had been executed on my behalf. The broker sold it on the day he called me.. So long (and uncomrtable story) short, I had to go to ocbc centre south to settle in cash (not cpf)"
3,Signed up Young Adults account with OCBC securities. It charges lower commission fees to the young adults account and they hold seminars for young adults. 
5,"PM me for details on how to get extra $20 rebates.   Many people have benefited from it!!!!!!!!!!  Referral code can be found here: https://seedly.sg/questions/anyone-has-promotional-referral-codes-for-geneco  Natural gas is going up so would recommend the fixed price offer, but decision is solely up to you. Markets are unpredictable. Trade war on the other hand causing oil prices to come down. But in Singapore, price usually increase faster than for it to come down from past experience...  Better act fast! Tariffs went up! Not sure current offers will remain for how long.  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/electricity-prices-sp-group-tariffs-increase-july-september-2019-11672840  Sign up online is easy and hassle free. So far prices have been the better ones and no false marketing like displaying the price without gst. March deals even better at 17.78c/kwh for 2/3 year plans.  However since July it has risen to 17.98c/kwh...   Would recommend fixed plan over discounts over tariff plans. Switch over now without hesitation as every day delayed is costlier than waiting to get a slightly better deal in future."

For the past few months, our bill shows a great difference. It is around 30-40% cheaper! We recommended our friends to Geneco and I encouraged them to make comparison. I was sure that they will still go with Geneco after comparison, and they did :)   Other points that attracted me- ‚Ä¢The bill is easy to read, simple, straightforward.  ‚Ä¢They are one of the main providers and thus reliable. ‚Ä¢No deposit is required whereas some companies require deposit (note: SP will refund u the portion of deposit for electricity) ‚Ä¢No hidden fees (which is very crucial to me as I prefer transparency) ‚Ä¢No disruption during the switch over and it was hassle free.  ‚Ä¢They do price match for 24 months plan with certain providers. ‚Ä¢If you have any query, feel free to ask me. You may PM me if you need advice on how to do the price match. I got mine! :)  I hope the above helps :)"
5,"Note: Tariff is going up 6.4% in Jul 19! Switch now to save more!  *Updated @ 15 Aug 19!* 1) $50 off bill for Get It Fixed 36 / Get It Fixed 24 / Get It Less 24 or Get Free Sundays plan. 2) $30 off bill for Get It Green Plan/ Get Sunny only 3) 4000 Link points for Get It Fixed 36 plan. 4) $50 credit for recurring payment with Standard Chartered card 5) 1% rebate for recurring payment with POSB card 6) 1% rebate for recurring payment with UOB card for 12 mths.  I have been using Geneco since January. The reasons why I chose Geneco:   1) They are very transparent in terms of price, no transmission loss charges, carbon tax absorbed, no hidden cost, no deposit required  2) They do a price match if you signed up for their 2 yrs plan. I emailed them to price match, and they responded fast- good after sales customer service   3) The bill is easy to read, simple, straightforward. My usual electricity bill is around $70. My current bill (based on entire cycle with Geneco) comes up to $44. This is 37% less than the average of $70. The bill has been quite stable as well, $40+ for the past few months. 4) They are one of the main providers and thus reliable.   I would personally recommend the 2 years plan since the tariff is increasing! Total possible rebate= $50(promo) + $50 (Standard Chartered credit card) + $20 (referral) = $120. A really good deal! :)"
5,"Recently switch to Geneco fixed rate 16.20cents with 24 months contract, the lowest rate in the town.  Sign up with 15% off on first bill, $20 referral promotion and lucky draw spin up to $20 dairy farm voucher. Please PM me for referral code if interested to sign up. It is a hefty sum of money to save.  "
5,"POST UPDATE as of 7th March 2019.  I have switched to Geneco Fixed 24months at 17.98 since last November. So far I have great experience with their customer service. Prompt call back and response rate when I leave my voice message for a return call back. Only setback for Geneco is, they only have e-billing which is separate from SP group. You may want to consider Tuas Power which is under same billing at 17.98 (incl gst) for their 2 years fixed rate. They are currently the only one who offers same billing.  After going through a review on various providers below are my personal findings for the 3rd Phase of Open Electricity Offer: Between discount tariff and fixed rate, I chose fixed rate as the tariffs have been increasing since the beginning of the year and I foresee it will continue to rise. The current best 2 years fixed rate plan is at 17.52 which iSwitch charges (but they do not have very transparent contract information as well as renewal offer, Hardcopy Billing: $1.07 per Bill (Inc GST) Service fee: $5.297 per month (Inc. GST)) which is lower than the discount tariff in the market. Current tariff is at 25.52 which SP charges and the most consistent discount tariff plan is at 25% lower which will set the tariff at 19.14. For current 2 years fixed rate, the next consistent 2 years fixed rate are from Geneco / Sembcorp / Keppel at 17.78 (includes gst).   Geneco does not require security deposit, absorb the transmission loss charges and they absorbed the carbon tax of 1% which took effect from 2019 (most retailers have opted in to cover these as well for this phase). Geneco is also one of the biggest power house generators in SG. SembCorp requires security deposit whereas Keppel requires installation of advanced smart metre 42.10 (incl gst) applies. On top of this, Geneco has a price match guarantee for their fixed 24 months plan if other retailers offer lower rate within 7 days of signing up.   P.S: other retailers are offering different incentives but ultimately I chose one that is consistent in addressing the big chunk of our monthly household bills. Cheers!"
4,"Customer service hotline is hard to get through. However, they call us back the next working day if we leave a message and contact number.  They were receptive in taking feedback for improvements, unlike most Customer service in Singapore that are defensive, patronising  or don't take followup actions. "
5,"With the launch of the Open Electricity Market, there are many electricity providers to choose from. It is quite a daunting task to choose the best provider.  What makes Geneco stand out from the rest is that they offer this Home Night Saver Plan which offers steep discount for off peak period from 12am to 6am that is very suitable for night owls and people who sleep with air-conditioned. Geneco also offers free AMI Smart meter installation which will allow half hourly monitoring of the electricity usage.  The transition from SingPower to Geneco was very smooth and Geneco allows the recurring payment of the bills to be charged to any VISA and Mastercard card unlike the case for  SingPower where they only allow the bill to be charged to a DBS/POSB issued credit card.  The best part was that all the transactions were done online, I managed to complete the whole switch over without even need to step out of the house."
1," I had accidentally signed up online as I had been trying out the referral code and immediately informed Geneco to cancel my application. I received a confirmation from Geneco within the same day.  However, 7 days later, I received a letter from SP informing that the switch will take place 2 days later.  Geneco's unfair and coercive tactics are unacceptable and should not be allowed to continue as the opening of the electricity market involves a massive number of consumers.  I am warning consumers to be careful when signing up."
5,Cheapest in town. Signed fix rate of 15.99 cent. I hope can re-contract at this rate after 24months for loyalty customers. Referral program was gd too! Enjoy many 20 dollars vouchers for giant/coldstorage use!
5,"I made the switch to Geneco and have seen significant cost savings!  Everyone should definitely make the switch to Geneco as there'll be a significant amount of cost savings in the long run. Assuming you use an average of 400 kWh per month, based on the rates offered by SP vs another electricity provider (Geneco):  SP: 400 kWh x $0.2279 per kWh = $91.16 Geneco: 400 kWh x $0.1778 per kWh = $71.12 Cost Savings = $20.04  Should you make the switch, the total cost savings per month would amount to $20.04 (~22%). Multiply that amount over 12 months and you'll be able tosave $240.48 which can be used for other expenses.  For me, I signed up with Geneco due to it's competitive rates at $0.1778 per kWh and hassle free transition and billing (recurring credit bill payment). Feel free to utilise the following promo codes if you're planning to make the switch! Do not hestitate to ask any questions to clarify your queries!  Other bank rebates available too (e.g. AMEX $40)"
5,"Many good reviews and explanation is detailed enough before i sign up the contract with Geneco. Rate is competitive with other electric provider in the market too, finally choose Geneco because your staff positive attitude. Look forward to your service rendered in future! üòä"
5,"Fast and efficient application process. The challenge was deciding which plan to select as there were many choices for different users. I decided to try one of their novel products free electricity on sundays. Clear billing details, I‚Äôm happy I made the switch. "
5,"the process of switching is easy, the rate is the lowest 0.1680/kwh. Save a lot! recommended!   paperless where is electrical bill. easy to access to geneco.com.sg and trend usage.  "
4,"Monthly electricity bill decreased by $20-$30, which is a substantial amount in itself! Loving the e-platform that is used to check our bills and monitor our usage. Saving the earth one step at a time."
5,Switched and already  Signed up with Geneco. By far the best and the lowest yet reasonable tariffs OEM providers in town. Was introduced by a fellow colleague about Geneco and the explanation about the process was also done by him. Grateful for the help and my family is definitely happy that we decided to switch to Geneco.
5,Ease of switching is the most important to me cos everything is done online. Billing is also done easily and can be paid via credit cards
5,"Switching over was a Breeze and billing statement was clear cut.   Did requested assistance from the customer via phone, waiting time was fast."
4,Sign up process was easy online. Bill comes on time into my email and company provides good rates and discounts for my bill
5,"It‚Äôs a great decision I made to switch to Geneco. With it‚Äôs cheaper rate, able to save money for other expenses. "
5,"Lots of rebate to enjoy. With its tie up with Singtel, it should prove more reliable than other company. Website and bill are easily located and monthly usage are track.  Recommended. "
5,Application online was straight forward. Geneco offers competitive prices and attractive rebates. No problem with them till now. Oh and I like the candid environment friendly videos and tips.
5,Genoco has helped me save a lot of $$. Customer service is helpful as well! I would highly recommend!
5,"Cheaper, accurate and easy to read Bills via email! I'm glad my friends and families converted to geneco!!!"
5,easy to sign up and hassle free.  I have earned more than $130 rebates by having the referral from my friends.  Most importantly having the low fixed rate thru out the contract period!
5,"The customer service representative on Facebook responded quickly as soon as the week was over and was patient enough when attending to my queries. And then there was one time when I had earlier called to ask about my problem in login in to Geneco's website but then the line was busy and I have to leave my number for them to call back. I didn't think that they will call, but they did and guide me on the steps to take to get logged in. And the best part of all was the rebates given for signing in with Geneco and the referral rebates given for both parties. I've had many rebates accumulated that will last me enough for almost half a year without having to pay my bills. Thank you, Geneco, you are a life saver! üëçüëçüëç"
5,Very thoughtful company....hold back my rebates so that I could earn the Amex rebates as it needs to charge at least $10 before the rebates kick in by August. The next bill they promptly used my remaining rebates with them to offset my bill. I'm impressed. Very done Genecoüëç
5,"I am a new user of Geneco and i have just happily received my first month bill from Geneco, a bit funny right? how come received bill will feel happy? no need to pay meh? The reason was my electric traffic for the new month was 273 kWh and if i not decided to switch over to Geneco, i support to pay $70.76 (273 x $0.2592) instead of $45.37 (incurred by Geneco) alone on electricity. Hence you can see how BIG is the saving right for the next 24 months :) furthermore my this month bill is $0 as it was offset from the promotion rebate offer by Geneco when i decided to switch over. So what are you waiting for?"
4,"So far no hidden or extra cost in the bills, bills are very straightforward, perhaps too straightforward that it doesn't include various promo or discounts or rebates used till u dig in deeper... "
5,Fuss free switch over. Good competitive pricing. Received bill notification via e-mail or can easily check via account in their website. Many modes of payment available. Loving it so far. üëçüèª
4,"One of the better fixed rate retailer out there! Hopefully they will launch an app soon for us to monitor our bills and past history transaction, include a live chat availability so it will be easier for us to reach out should we require any form of assistance. Overall no regrets signing up for Geneco. Definitely would recommend anyone who hasn't convert their electric retailer to do so soon üëç"
5,Fuss free giro payment. Rates way cheaper than SP services.  So far never encountered any issues though I see people facing giro deduction problems and such. Added in my credit card at the start and never had to care for the bills again. 
5,"Cheaper than SP. Nice interface via login. The beauty is I am able to link multiple properties to 1 login. Not sure about the other electricity providers but I don't have any complaint so far for Geneco.  If I only have 1 feedback, it would be to tone down the environmental marketing aspect. If done subtlety, it would be cool but a bit over pretentious in my opinion."
5,The switch over is hassel free and I worry less over the fluctuation of the price as I am paying a fix rate over the period as stated on the contract. Thank you so much. 
4,Although the phone number never gets picked up response email is very good and prompt and to the point. Th issue i face is SP used to publish Actual Meter reading whereas Geneco doesn't provide this info in bill as they say this reading is taken by SP!.. But Still Geneco Charges based on Meter reading Taken by SP and hence they should be able to provide the same?
5,"So far it's great experience with Geneco. I did two weeks of research in Internet and in most of the roadshows across the Singapore. At the end after careful consideration of the factors such as benefits, discounts , charges per unit and the reviews on service excellence I decided to chose Geneco as my electricity vendor. I referred most of my friends after I experienced the great value services by my self. Almost every individual whom I referred are quite happy and feeling joy of being Geneco customers. Thanks Geneco for more savings and high quality services. "
5,Hopped over to Geneco a week before and the sign-up process was pretty much a breeze. Yet to see the first bill so let's see how it goes. 
5,Our family switched to genco as it has the most value as compared to other plans out there. This resulted in substantially more savings in electricity that could be put to better use. 
5,"There were initial hiccups where all forms of communications did not work. No one responded to calls, emails, social media when I requested assistance. But now the process seems to have been ironed out. Electricity supply transition is seamless and I'm now enjoying about 20% savings every month. "
5,I've been on the Get It Fixed 24 months plan since last year. Transition from SP was a fuss-free and fully digital process. Monthly payments are easily settled via automatic recurring payments online. They have very informative and creative posts on Instagram and Facebook too. Strongly recommend Geneco :) 
5,"Changed to Geneco last year and no complaints from me so far.  The switch was seamless - a filling of the form and before I knew it, I was on to a new electricity provider.  In my first month of using, I didn‚Äôt receive my electricity bill and was a little worried because SP Power didn‚Äôt reflect my electricity usage. Facebook messaged them and was answered within 2 hours  that the first bill will come in 45-60 days. The promptness of their reply assured me of their high standards and care for their customers.  I also love love love their referral system where I can intro my friends and family for cheaper electricity bill while earning additional rebates. You may PM me for more details if you need more information.  I also like that it is e-billing because I hate receiving physical bills. And great that I can use my credit card to pay for it to earn cashback/ points/ miles!!  With the rising tariffs, coupled with the competitive pricing of Geneco, I‚Äôm glad I changed to Geneco. "
5,Smooth and fast transfer from SP to Geneco! My bills are now much cheaper and I get rebates for signing up too! Fast response from Geneco when utilising my 7 day price match guarantee. Highly recommended!
5,Hassle free experience for the switch to Geneco. Sit back and relax after the sign up for switch.  Enjoy savings with no headaches for any followups etc after the switch. 
5,I switched to geneco last month and received $68 rebate. I save 30% and pay 0 at first month. Recommended!!üëç
5,I joined recently and still had no bills charged (> 1month). Overall very good value for money provider.  Great rebates and low cost from other comments and the website is very easy to read and transparent.
3,Geneco since its tie up with singtel has increased its rates  dramatically. Congrats to those who locked in at 16.2 kwh and 15.9 kwh. Its billing system is as follows; bill comes on 25th 1800hrs you must pay by 25th 2359 hrs. If not penalized at least $4. Customer service is 1 day lag. Otherwise Geneco is good. 
5,"Choose geneco Reason:  1. top2 mainstream supplier, no need worry close shop  2. Save 22% around against regulated tariff  3. $50/$60 off limited to first few thousands registered  4. Bank rebate, up to $40  5. no new meter required unless go for flexiable  6. No deposit  7. No transmission loss."
5,"My wife and I did extensive research on the various resellers in preparation of the opening of our district. We eventually settled for Geneco's Fixed-It 24 and one of main reasons for it was their Price Guarantee which gives us a piece of mind knowing that Geneco's rates would remain competitive in the market.  We did our sign-up at the roadshow at Vivocity and the staff there (Cassandra) was friendly and took time off to explain the various plans despite us being a few days short of switching. On the eve of the date that our district was open for the switch, she followed up with email and arranged a convenient time so that we can see her to sign up without a queue or hassle. The switch over was hassle free and now we are seeing a reduction of close to 30% of our regular electricity bills.  Probably the only improvement is for Geneco to develop an app for mobile phones so that consumers can easily check on their bills and usage rather than to keep logging into the website."
5,Thanks Geneco! I just switched in May 19 and my electricity bill in Jun 19 is lower by $30.  I'm sure I'll save even more for the next 3 months since the electricity tariff has just gone up for Jul-Sep 19.  I'm so glad I switched.
5,"Very efficient and cost saving electricity supplier. Previously before switching my electricity bill was always around 120, but now its only 85! Thank you Geneco for making my day üòò"
5,"Switching to open market electricity has helped me to better understand my electricity consumption rate. Moreover, they offer new sign-ups with rebates and I had almost 2 months free. Currently, I'm using the fixed discount rate and I have been saving almost 20% based on bills before the switch. Thank you Geneco and Singtel as well for the great collaboration!"
5,"The application process was fuss-free with a easy to navigate website, the rebates were credited to my account after my application has been approved within 2 weeks. Currently I have yet to make any payment, as I still have credit balance from my referrals. Thank you geneco."
5,Initially was thinking whether by swooping to new electricity supplier will cause any distruption to my house electricity. But eventually still give it a go and no regret sigining up with Geneco. Just that if was able to sign up few months earlier will be even better as can save more money.  Thanks Geneco as each month electricity bill can save more than 20 plus percentage which i can use it to pay for nearly 85% of my water bill.  Easy signing up with them. Fast and smooth...
5,I signed up online when they opened up to Punggol residents. The sign-up was a breeze and done within 5 minutes. The best thing is I can refer to my friends and family straight after my sign-up and I earn quite a lot of rebates from there to off-set my bill. My electricity bill has been cheaper by 30% since I switched to Geneco which saved a lot for me. Geneco is not just providing me electricity but they shared with me about sustainability and eco-living through interesting and hands-on events. This reflects the image of the company not only providing me electricity but also encouraged me to cared for the environment. I highly recommend To those who haven‚Äôt sign-up to join the Geneco community. 
4,"I chose Geneco fixed price 24 mths as I heard it‚Äôs the cheapest.   Altho I‚Äôm senior citizen, I find signing up online quite easy. Can even get $20 rebate if u use referral code which is the mobile nbr of your friends who are already with Geneco.  My bill has gone down with these rates. No deposit required.  Customer service line also only short wait when I called to check on billing. "
5,I've done my calculations and GENECO offers best value for money so far. Platform is easy to use and payment can be done on various platform. Convenient and best so far.
5,Switched in late 2018. So far billing has been nice and easy. Minor bug bear in that the dates are not on calendar basis so the bills hit my credit card on slightly different dates and hence statement month.  Payments are consistently lower than when I was on SP and there hasn't been any issues that I have noticed so far.  
5,I switched my electricity provider to Geneco without any interruption. Geneco customer service is responsive & help to get you the best plan for ur electricity needs. I will love to continue with Geneco after my contract ends. 
5,I am new with geneco so far so good my experience switching over is good. I'm glad I switched over and helps me save a lot for my electricity bills. I called their customer service so far I'm happy as they're helpful to my queries. I didn't sign up from roadshow but I sign up online and with the customer service people who attended me I was able to find my way to sign up online and get a good deal. As a busy working  mom of 2 small kids it helped me a lot to switch over To Geneco I love geneco hope they will serve the same way as good as when they started. Keep it up üëçüòä thanks 
5,"Firstly, I find Geneco rates are reasonable. The bill are neatly presented  for easy to understand. Like their generous bill rebates for certain credit card payment which helps to lighten our spendings in this uncertainty economic period."
4,"Things to know: 1) Sign up using referral online will get slightly more rebate compare to roadshow. ($10-20). All promo/roadshow all similar amt of rebate. Just whether you get voucher or rebate. Suggestion:DIY with a referral code.  2) Takes 1-2 months for the billing to start. 3) Referral code rebate is fuss free. You use someone referral code, you get $20 bucks rebate and they get $20 bucks rebate too. Stackable. So people who keep sharing will get more rebate and their electricity bill may be free ultimately. I also have referral code but lazy to share, *not thick skin enough haha, if you need can pm cause you get $20 rebate instead of giving to the roadshow guy if u ownself sign up* 4) Bill not sent together with SP gas and water. Only E-bill. 5) Signed the fixed rate 24m, saved quite a bit by simply switching. No need worry fix or not fix rate. Long term will average out. Ultimately, use less electricity and get more rebate is the game. But like all credit card promo it will end one day so no need worry over it too. 6) Credit card rebate will take some time before it is reflected. 7) Did I compare between companies, roughly, realised mostly the same. Geneco partner with Singtel, aggressive with publicity (as you can see now.. haha) so assumed stable. 8) Was concern for Customer service as some mentioned earlier when they first started. But no issues so far. No point worrying since most cust service from other provider is also not 100% realible. 9) No deposit fee/other fees being charge*so far* 10) SP will refund you your deposit and that can offset some any for your gas/water. 11) No problem for Govt rebates, all auto. 12) No auto reading of your meter unless you buy the device (Pay from SP) but they will install in all buildings down the road for free anw. So estimates for electricity is still being done unless you submit your reading (have not tried).   Cheers, Use less electricity. "
5,"I have switched to Geneco since Apr 19. No distruption at all. It is good as we can get have rebates/promotion by referal and promotion. Most important is a fixed price, I have save in my bill. I have signed for 2 years contract."

1,I referred My Sister switched to Geneco. I did not get my $20 referral and my Sister been paying $19.23 monthly through giro. A single lady living alone the electricity can go as high as $130++ when she‚Äôs working in 7 days a week. She called up Geneco and emailed but was told to check with bank but her bank statement already indicated $19.23 deduction through Giro monthly. Told her to call Geneco first thing in the morning and get them to read the meter monthly before billing her. It‚Äôs absurd to deduct $19.23 with increasing of tariff bill $130++ for a her hdb flat when one work spend 10 hours out not at home. She will definitely switched back to SP once her contract over. I‚Äôm being blamed as a bad referral.
5,I signed up with AMEX and I got another $40 off from AMEX. You can get a further $78 off if you sign up their fixed 2 year plan. All in the total rebates I got are 78+40+20(friend referral) = $138 There are promo if you use different cards like UOB ONE Credit Card where you can get 5% off the bill if you use your credit card to pay the recurring bill.
5,"Based on my experience, a very easy switch to them from SP. And there is no hidden charges so far! Recommend!!!"
3,I'm have swtiching to Geneco since last year Dec 18. anyhow i noticed my March billing have 2 line items. a) feb month consumption - understate estimate with xx amount and b) mar month consumption usages with actual meter reading. i'm so doubt on the billing as in how they come out the understated consumption in Feb since they have no actual meter reading on that month. i have been calling and emailing them 4-5 times and they couldnt give me a proper answer and even i have requested them to give me the meter reading. they did give me the meter reading but without feb month reading and skip to mar actual meter reading. this is ridiculous becuase you have give me dec estimation meter reading but you purposely skip feb details and jump to mar reading. somthing is fishy there as in how they calcalate my over/under estimate meter reading. until now they have ignore my email. i'm suspect that geneco manipulate the meter reading by using excuses with under estimate reading where does not exist at all. this is becuase i have no such thing with SP services and after changes it still SP services is the one to go for meter reading and not Geneco. i'm not sure whether other customer will having the same issue/ case. please help to comment and share. Thanks
5,It is definitely cheaper than SP. Every month saves few ten dollars. One year can save few hundred dollars. 
5,"Took the 12 months discounted plan. Selected Geneco because their website was clean, informative, cancellation penalty etc is reasonable and they gave good signup freebies. Coupled with additional rebate for UOB One card, I decided to sign with them. Also faced an issue because my card expired and auto deduction failed. Got through their cust service and issue was resolved quickly and painlessly. I'm very pleased with Geneco!"
1,After signing with Geneco my bill is even higher then SP.  they mention consumption information and meter readings are provided by SP Group. Really strange kWH is higher.  Their reply takes about a month and their reply - We advise to submit your on meter readings so that you are able to monitor your consumption as well. Termination of your account at this point would incur an early termination charge of $130.  What a crap! Don‚Äôt con by them. Regretted. 
1,"give 1 star because its a bit cheaper, service only give 0 stars, email never reply, call few hours no answer, left phone number rare call back, any time you want change contract or terminate, will face big trouble"
5,"It is easy to indentify, under the fact sheet there is a column stating ->Direct Billing .  If it states yes then it will be seperate billing and if it states no then SP will bill you instead ."
5,Initial promo was very nice and payment method is comfort. Only few things to improve on view logs easily.
5,Have walked through roadshows and read many online reviews; Geneco seems to be of best value and reliability among all the companies.   EDIT: no disruption to switch and it's been 2 months since switching and the savings on electricity per month are a whopping ~30%.   *Certain credit cards also offer rebates. 
5,"*10 Aug*  I cannot emphasise any furthur how easy it is to switch, and that the amount of value and savings from switching to Geneco seems almost ridiculous.   You can continue researching all you want, but I believe this has the best value and also the most reliable amongst all the companies.   You literally will pay nothing for the first few months.   I've picked to use the fixed 24 mth contract (due to rising tariffs). Don't end up paying more if tariffs keep increasing!  Exclusive to online sign up. + Use promo code to get $78 rebate + SC Credit Card gives a 1-time $50 cashback for bills! Key in my referral code for additional $20 off. Total additional rebates up to $148! "
4,I'm making a switch by tomorrow. Can anyone let me know whether the rebates are still the same. Any voucher given & how much?
5,It's been 3 months and so far the bills have shown significant savings. No hiccups in the switch and the rebates were useful. Strongly consider this as your option when deciding on your electricity provider.
5,"Hi!   I have switched to Geneco 2 months ago. Really great savings compared to SP power! I stayed in a 3rooms flat, even so, my bill has dropped significantly by $20-30 a month!   I have signed up using someone‚Äôs referral code here and benefitted from the $20 extra rebate!  PM me if you need my referral code to have $20 rebate off your bill as well! Thank you! :) "
5,"Got the 24m plan at 0.17 cent/kw tariff, immediate saving of 20-25%. Worth it. Service and reply are good as well"
5,I switched to Geneco thr the recommendation of my Fren and it was a great choice made. Signing up at ease with no hassle and enjoyed the good promotion perks upon sign up.
5,"I switched to Geneco because they have good reviews, offer price match guarantee and they have very good sign up promotions.   "
5,"My Bill Previously vs now (Including Taxable Charges)  SP Group 446 kWh = $101.64 1 kWh = 0.227  Geneco 330.00 kWh = $55.19  1 kWh = 0.167  If under Genoco I used 446 kWh, it will be $74.48.  I would have save $27.16  I had chose Get It Fixed 24. "
5,Simply the best from the best. You can never go wrong with Geneco for the following reasons: 1) No hidden fees 2) One of Singapore largest Power Generating company. 3) Highest rebates and best tariff. 4) Actively involved in being the main game changer by supporting local and social startups that aims towards sustainable development and lifestyle. 5) Always focus on go green. 6) Timely response to your enquiry. Confirm will reply your enquiries. 7) Lots of giveaways for the users.  I have saved so much using Geneco that I don't feel guilty of sharing with the rest. Please PM me if you need genuine and useful referral codes.
5,"Easy Application, Easy to track bills and Easy payment through credit card! Thank you for Easy Discount! "
5,Have switched over last month and was happy to not pay anything yet due to Geneco's generous rebates.
5,"PM me for referral code. Had compared different electricity provider and Geneco is the chosen one for me. There is no hidden charges, security deposit, monthly administration fees and I can save more than 30% (17.98¬¢ for fixed plan) against regulated tariff of 25.92¬¢ per kWh. Didn't want to change at first but the benefit of these convinced me to change.   #GenecoSG #PowerTheChange #OEM"
5,"With our Get It Fixed 24 and 36, enjoy a fixed low rate of 17.78cts/kWh vs SP new tariff of 25.92cts/kWh throughout your contracted period with no hidden costs. That's more than 30% savings! No need to worry about the next price hike! "
5,"With the raised electricity tariff, it is imperative to switch to Geneco to get more savings off your monthly bills, it is easy to Sign up for your parents too. No hassles."
5,Definitely lowered our bills thank you! Definitely lowered our bills thank you! Definitely lowered our bills thank you! 
5,33% electric bill saver. Good for everyone as there's a referral program which rewards all. Will look forward Geneco promotion.
5,"With the raised electricity tariff, it is imperative to switch to Geneco to get more savings off your monthly bills , it is easy to Sign up for your parents too. no hassles."
5,Do yourself a favour and SWITCH TO GENECO! Confirm cheaper than SP and u no longer need to monitor your electricity usage as they‚Äôre indeed cost effective!
5,Great savings and promotions. Totally worth the switch. The bills get sent to my email promptly every month and the website is intuitive. I am glad i chose Geneco 
4,Fuss free provider with multiple methods of payment  Only downside is customer service hotline hardly gets througj
5,Great deal and easier payment. Transition was smooth as well. I have save 30% monthly on my bill since the switch.
5,Perfect! Got rebates with a certain credit cards and I also save a little every month with the slightly reduced fees! Geneco FTW!
5,"One of the highest bill rebates. Chose Geneco because of reputable and reliable company. Opted for 36 mths contract without hesitance. Hassle-free switching, unlimited enjoyment. "
5,"I have been using geneco for the past 2 months, and is really save 30% of the monthly bill without worry about the price hike and there is no hidden price on it. So sign up geneco."
4,Switched to  Geneco since April & so far I'm happy with the performance and bill results. Hopefully Geneco stay competitive always
5,Great service provider with great rebates and plans to suit all needs. PM me for referal code for both us to get $20 rebate for new sign up. 
5,Customer service is responsive and quick. Really save a lot after switching to geneco! No hidden charges too!
5,Switching to Geneco is seamlessly easy and fast. You get one of the lowest fixed electricity rate and you never miss a billing mail as all is done electronically on email ! Switch to Geneco now !
5,I have switched to Geneco fixed rate with 24 months contract recently so far i do not has any issue. It helped me to save my Electricity  cost
5,I just signed up Geneco 24months fixed plan as electricity tariff is set to increase. Check Geneco for the latest credit card promotion as well.
5,"Oil going up so would recommend the fixed price offer, but decision is solely up to you. Markets are unpredictable. Trade war on the other hand causing oil prices to come down. But in Singapore, price usually increase faster than for it to come down from past experience.   Sign up online is easy and hassle free. So far prices have been the better ones and no false marketing like displaying the price without gst. March deals even better at 17.78c/kwh for 2/3 year plans. Would recommend fixed plan over discounts over tariff plans. Switch over now without hesitation as every day delayed is costlier than waiting to get a slightly better deal in future."
5,"Latest!!! Up to $128 worth of rebates.  I have switched to Geneco. Have you switched to enjoy lower electricity bills? If not, sign up with Geneco.   Signing up online is similar to signing up at roadshows.  Geneco offers one of the lowest rate in Singapore. 17.78 cents per kWh (including GST). Plus price matching.  Use the following to enjoy additional rebates: Use AMEX credit cards for recurring billing to enjoy an additional $40 rebates. Or use DBS or UOB credit cards to enjoy the standard credit card rebates."
5,"Review: I have been using Geneco since April. The reasons why I chose Geneco:   1) They are very transparent in terms of price, no transmission loss charges, carbon tax absorbed, no hidden cost, no deposit required  2) They do a price match if you signed up for their 2 yrs plan. I emailed them to price match, and they responded fast- good after sales customer service   3) The bill is easy to read, simple, straightforward. My usual electricity bill is around $70. My current bill (based on entire cycle with Geneco) comes up to $44. This is 37% less than the average of $70. The bill has been quite stable as well, $40+ for the past 4 months. 4) They are one of the main providers and thus reliable.   I would personally recommend the 2 years plan since they do price matching within 7 days. Total possible rebate= $68 + $40 (AMEX credit card) + $20 (referral) = $128. A really good deal!!! :)"
1,"Just switched slightly over a month ago. There was a glitch with the online form so when I confirmed the contract, it said I had signed up for the Get It Fixed 24 when I was clearly reading the contract for Get It Fixed 36. I immediately wrote to Geneco AND spent more than half an hour on the phone just waiting to speak to a customer service officer to resolve this issue but the customer service officer told me there was nothing they could do. She said she would ""escalate the matter"" and cc me in the email chain, but surprise surprise! Never got anything. The online form that I filled up regarding this issue also never got a response. Let's just hope I don't meet with any other problems throughout the term, because I have no confidence it will get resolved. "
5,Hasslefree signup via online form. Got both the promotion rebate and the referral rebate. $40 cashback from amex too if u pay by amex recurring bill from now till sept! 
5,Changed to this one few months ago and never looked back. I saved around $70 per month after changing to this company!
5,Change your electrical supplier to save cost! I chose to geneco and it help my family save $50 per month! 
4,This is one of the most popular oem recommended by many online blogs. The rates quite competitive and you can stack with many discount 
5,Easy to sign up with price match option. Good value too. Significant savings compared to using the usual Singapore Powers rates. 
5,Choose the fixed 24 plan and never regret after that. Been saving lot of $$ from switching to Geneco!
5,Switched from SP services to the fixed rate plan. It's a no brainer. Sign up promos are excellent! Hassle free billing as well.
5,"Easy to apply, seamless. Also love that they had referral code so that I could intro it to my friends and family! Customer support was great too and prompt! I love it :) "
5,"Recently switch over, satisfied with the fuss free process. I like their portal which is simple yet informative. "
5,Good rate and clean portal.  Great product. One of the cheapest available in the market and also no hidden charges.
4,I switched to Genevieve lately and stacked the online promo with the credit card.   Overall I would recommend this !   Pros 1) The web interface is good thus far  2) The rates are cheapest in the in market   What was no good for me:  1) I think the geneco forgot my application ! My Cousin applied later and started first   Areas of improvement  1) app for tracking  2) more real time notifications  3) better follow up 
5,"Just switched to Geneco (https://www.geneco.sg) because of: -2 years fixed rate at 17.78 cents per kWh -No deposit required, no transmission loss charges, no carbon tax charges.  Having Promotion/Rebate now!!! $50 promo code : For 2 year plan $40 if you have either AMEX/Maybank/OCBC for limited sign ups and period."
5,"Just signed my family up for the 3-year fixed plan! it‚Äôs a hassle free switch with no hidden costs bills sent monthly via email (save the Earth~) also, lots of savings from current promotions by signing up online now recurring bill payments for AMEX/Maybank/OCBC credit cards: $40 rebate - another $20 credit for you by using a referral code from another Geneco user "
5,"Been reviewing the different options available and finally decided to go with Geneco, with their Get It Fixed 24 plan (24-mths fixed rate at 17.78c/kWh - very competitive rate, good rebates and no security deposit."
5,"Simple application process with attractive rebates (via online sign-up, credit card and referrals) and competitive pricing. "
5,"Geneco is indeed the cheapest currently for multiple price plans. The 24 months plan also has a price match guarantee. Generally, prices should be steadily increasing for the next year or 2, so switching to a fix plan makes sense."
5,"Easy to sign up online, need only to submit front and back of your NRIC and no SP bill document prove needed."
5,"After some comparisons with all the energy market providers and studies of various plans offered, I signed up Geneco‚Äôs 2 years fixed rate. I believed this to be one of the safest bet for my family‚Äôs electricity bill..."
5,"Decided on Geneco after comparing with other retailers. Application is easy with just a few clicks. Promo and referral rebates credited, plus OCBC recurring Payment rebates of $40. Total saving : $138. "
5,"Pro: 1. Cost $0.1778c/KWh (*as of 12 May 2019) for Fixed 24 To me this is the cheapest for 24 months. There are others which may suggest an even lower amount, but just take note about other hidden service fees that is not written down. These hidden fees can make a difference to the savings you want.  2. Credit Card Cash Rebate If you charge your monthly electricity bill with OCBC, you can get $40 cash rebate (expiry: 30 June 2019 with a limit of 3000 customers). Another card would be Amex. POSB Everyday card has 1% cash rebate for monthly bill. BUT, what I've seen so far is that the maximum rebate you will get from here is $1.  3. Rebate At roadshows, the salesperson might offer a slightly different discount. For online application, you can get $78 (for fixed plan over 24/36 months) Once you sign up, you can see the rebate amount locked in at the ""View Geneco Rebate"" section.   4. Friend referral rebate We can both get additional $20 off from our bill. Ultimately, the best part of all these rebates is that it can be added upon. Hence, the total rebate can reach an impressive $138.   Con: 1. Billing arrangement It does not have a paper bill. It does not even offer to have one by charging. So you can only search it through their app, website or when they send you an email for the billing. You kind of save the Earth, but it's not so friendly for friends out there who are not so tech savvy.   These are the factors I've considered. Ultimately, I feel the most important is the cost and rebate, which will give you a better idea of which you would want to sign up for. Of course, you have to be sure that there aren't any hidden cost. So far, I don't see any from this company. The rebate is great as it can be added upon each other, unlike some who did not allow multiple promotions added upon each other.   Hope you guys find this useful."
5,I have just signed up on 2 May after doing some comparisons and reading all the reviews online.. üòä  I would personally recommend the 2 years plan since they do price matching within 7 days. Total possible rebate= $78 (sign up) + $50 (Standard Chartered credit card) + $20 (referral) = $148. A really good deal!

4,Joined in late Mar and still no bills charged. overall very good value for money provider.  Great rebates and low cost.  Would recommend again.
5,"Looking to switch power supplier?  Go for Genoko fix 24months which has now lowered to 17.78cents/kw monthly. Is super worth than before! To me, no need go to try here and there, waste the time until the all the power supply rate went up and regret later.   Pls note No security deposit and also geneco provide low early termination fee compared to others. You check through their website and found is worth, then is easy to sign up by online. www.geneco.sg   My brother and i  have saved hundreds till date! Change today and save the money to buy other thing!"
5,Manage to sign up the fixed rate at 16.2 and is quite please with it since i can forsee the tariff will only go up in SG.
5,Sign-up process was fast and easy. Have yet to start my plan but am hoping that I do see my bill go down as advertised. 
5,"Just switched over to Geneco from Ohm after comparing a couple of plans; 2 years fixed price is 17.78 c/kWh includes GST and is cheaper than my existing Ohm's plan and all other plans currently. Sharing what I did to get the following rebates!  Ive also used the promotion code to get $68 off your bills. Also utilised the $40 AMEX rebate (first 30 000 cards only, hurry)  https://offerenroll.americanexpress.com/enroll/EnrollmentSitePage?offer=73676OpenElectricityMarket  There's also 1% rebate for POSB Everyday card, and up to 5% UOB One Card Rebate + additional 1% UOB offer for 12 months with $10 rebate before 30 June 2019 for UOB cards!"
5,Signed up with Get it Fixed24!!! (Only plan with PRICE MATCH GUARANTEE within 7 days of sign-up)   >>> BEST Deal in Town over long term !!! contract > $40 rebate using OCBC Credit Card as recurring payment >  No new meter required >  No security fee / deposit >  No transmission loss charges 
4,"I just signed up 24mths fixed under Geneco's getitfixed24 plan.  Some things to help you decide if you wanna follow me.  *Why fixed not variable?* Cos prices will most likely rise since fuel is limited. So fixed can guarantee low price for a period.  *why 24mths not 6mths?* Cos after 6 mths the price is likely to increase and they might charge more in the subsequent contract. So 24 mths guarantees the low rate for a longer time.  *why geneco and why better to sign up online?* Seems to offer more rebate than other big players. $78 off. (Only available online not at roadshows; roadshows only give $68)  Plus has referral plan that can give you extra $20 off. (Only available online not at roadshows)  And a wide range of credit card rebates. (Up to $50 off). Other companies like keppel and senoko dont have as many credit card deals.  No deposit needed. Other companies like iswitch and sembcorp has deposit ranging from $30 to $60 for hdb.  *things to note if u sign up with geneco* No paper bills Have to check online with account login First bill will take about 1 to 2 mths before it is up. There are penalties for early termination, late payment or failed card deducations.  Hope these help. üòä"
5,"Sign up process was easy, and everything was completed very quickly online. Great rebates when I signed up with:  ‚Ä¢¬†$78 off bill for my Get It Fixed 24 plan ‚Ä¢¬†Referral code: $20 rebates ‚Ä¢ Standard Chartered card: $50 rebate when you set up a recurring bill charge!  ‚Ä¢ Total received $148 in rebates and savings - very worth making the switch now!"
5,I have just changed over to Geneco. The price is just awesome! Saved $50 using promo code for 36months plan and another $20 from friend's referral code.
5,"Signed up on-line for the 2 year fixed plan few months ago. Reasons for choosing Geneco: 1) No deposit required, no transmission loss charges, no carbon tax charges as compared with the other major operators 2) No disruption during the switch over and it was hassle free 3) The bill is user friendly"
5,"Reasons for choosing Geneco: 1) Geneco is Seraya Energy‚Äôs retail energy brand, who is one of the leading provider in the market 2) No deposit required, no transmission loss charges, no carbon tax charges as compared with the other major operators 3) No disruption during the switch over and it was hassle free 4) The bill is user friendly 5) Better promos now than the period i signed up during Feb 6) Have been enjoying couple months of free utility bills. üòä  Hope that helps. Thanks for reading and using my referral code. :)   #MAITULIAO!! I will recommend to sign up on-line either for the 24 months/36 months fixed plan for a huge savings.  #GenecoSG"
5,"I had Signed up Geneco after comparing with other retailers. Application is easy with just a few clicks. Promo and referral rebates credited, plus UOB recurring payment rebates.  For general users, I recommend the default 24month fixed plan as it's very simple and moderate risk."
5,"Recently signed up with Geneco with the online promo of $68 rebate. Whatsmore, it actually allows us to add referral code hence, that's another $20 off. Signing up and switching over is easy, which can be done less than 10 mins.   There is a price match guarantee for the 24 months contract.  The only bad point probably the separate billing from SP bill. All in all, I believe it is still better than sticking with SP."
5,Really good service although no contact a few week then you will receive a letter from PUB. You can get additional rebate when you apply AMEX credit card or you can use credit card UOB or CITI or DBS card.
5,"Just signed up with Geneco for Get it fixed 24, as they provide price match guarantee offer (note: Each plan is only entitled price match once). Plus Geneco currently had the best rebate offer up to $148 for online sign up as compared to other for price rate at $0.1778/kwh. Went to their roadshow, they provide $10 groceries voucher with $68 offer and up to $40 credit card offer (total $118). So I would recommend sign online to get more rebate."
5,Reasons why I signed up and why you should:   1) Customer service very responsive over the phone as opposed to closest competitor  2) Best promotion now in the market!!
5,"Update as of 25 June: Promo already dropped to $68 in June so sign up soon before it drops further! Simple and no brainer-process below:  1. Sign up your chosen plan here https://www.geneco.sg/residential/electricity-plans/  - You will need your account number and IC copy - I used Amex credit card for recurring to get $40 off.  2. After submitting, you will receive an SMS and email confirmation. 3. 2 weeks later, you will receive an email from SP to submit meter reading via a link 4. Once submitted, you will receive the final confirmation from Geneco in around 2-3 days. "
5,Personally signed up for the 24 months fixed plan as I doubt the variable tariff will fall to such a low rate unless there is a market depression. The $68 one-time rebate off your bill is also extremely attractive which works out to an additional $3.25 off your monthly bill for 24 months. The tariff atm is pretty high at $0.2439/kWh as compared to the fixed rate Geneco is offering at $0.1778/kWh.
5,I just switch over to Geneco to enjoy the lower rate and it was hassle free. I recommend you to switch ASAP too. Happy saving and switching!üíï https://www.geneco.sg/residential/promotions/
1,"I totally regret signing up for it. Very poor customer service. Delayed my contract start date for 2months (without letting me know in advance).   Tried email them, called them and Facebook message. Did not receive any reply. "
4,"Signed up the 3 Years Fixed Plan 17.78 cents 2 May 2019 - went for 4000 Link Points + 5% UOB discount.  Just received confirmation of switch SP to Geneco.  Signed up the same for my MIL as she doesn't know internet - appointed myself as her Authorised Representative.  She got $78 + UOB 5% discount, I got the $20 referral.  Quite convenient as I log-in to Geneco website and I can manage the two accounts through the same login.  If I sign up for my Dad, I can log-in and manage three accounts together.  Discovered this by accident, because I wanted to use the same ID and password, so that no need to remember so many passwords."
1,"Terrible customer care, no one answer phone call and no one reply emails. Is there any problem with the company?"
5,"Great value with the cheapest plans on offer, and good referral programme. Also super easy to sign-up, took me 3 mins. Also like their brand and Green Energy ethos! Save money and save the environment!"
1,"I signed up with Geneco in January at a roadshow and was promised rebate when I refer someone. I did and provided the salesgal the referral code which she claimed she keyed in and registered for us. There was no rebate until March. I emailed Geneco over ten times for over a month, first two emails, they keep directing us to check our account. The next five or six emails they claim we make the mistake for not providing the referral code. I attached the screenshot twice and they still insist it was not possible. After i comment here, the customer service called to apologize and promised that he is in front of the system and will input right away. What do you think? Yup, not done again."
1,"Yes, Hot line is not able to take the call, Tried for several hours and got, Even raised the concern through email, Not received the answer, Look like not taken the electrical reading properly and bill/web site not able to know the bill between what is the starting and ending?"
1,"Your hotline is simply terrible. I waited 30 mins and still, no one picks up ? are your customer hotline non-existant? what if I have a billing problem? what if I have a power surge and require immediate assistance?"
4,I just signed up for the 24mths plan. i find the $50 off bill attractive; I also like the AMEX tie up. Will recommend. The hotline is not responsive but email response is good. 
5,"Signed up online for the 2 year fixed plan in March. Reasons for choosing Geneco: 1) No deposit required, no transmission loss charges 2) No disruption during the switch over and it was hassle free 3) The bill is user friendly 4) Better promos now : - enjoy cash rebate of $50 or $60. - $40 credit if you have either AMEX/Maybank/OCBC for limited sign ups and period "
5,Sign up with genoco at one of the roadshow Rate at 0.1798/kwh for 24months all inclusive charges $15 rebate (online will be 20.19% off) $20 rebate using referral code $40 cash back using ocbc debit/credit card for recurring payment. $6 drinks voucher with scratch to win cards (roadshow only) 
5,"Great customer service, reputable company and has the lowest rates for 3 year plan. Geneco does not require security deposit, has no hidden charges or service fees. In addition, the rates are carbon tax inclusive and no transmission loss charges. Low early termination fees. You may visit www.geneco.sg to sign up. "
1,Customer service is super lousy and hotline don't get through plus email reply very late. Regret signing up with them!! 
5,"Take fixed 36 months at 17.88 cent / Kwh, worry free for electric increase."
5,Online sign up was easy and fast and no deposit for singaporeans and PRs. Price for 24 months fixed plan is one of the best. Definitely much better than normal sp pricing. üëç
5,"My electricity bill is cheaper now. It is also easier to check my bill because every month, geneco will send me email. I used to have issues tracking my SP bills and always end up paying late charges. Overall, I‚Äôm satisfied and happy!"
5,Very good service from call centre staff. Simple to understand policy. Instant approval. The lifetime NCD coverage is a great bonus to have.
1,"Stashaway was the most overpromise, under-deliver app that I have been on. I put in 12k on a medium risk profile, and my return was 60 dollars on 12k after 8 months! To top it off they charge 8 dollars per month as fee to further eat into the return. I would be okay with all that because after all investments go up and down all the time but they even lack transparency. I asked them to give me a timeline chart of my returns so I can see how my investment performed over a period of time, and their Customer Service tells me that they can't provide me a time series. Quoting their agent:  ""What we can provide is a plot for Portfolio 12 and Portfolio 28 (with S&P500 as a benchmark). Yours was a Portfolio 16 so it would be somewhere in between those 2.""  Really!   It took them a month to finally give me a time series plot of my investment. I'm not sure how a platform can't provision for basic transparency and yet expect people to trust them with their investments."
5,"The app is really well designed, and like how I've been able to save effortlessly. Was sceptical at first but eventually managed to see my money grow even more than the 3.88% some bank accounts offer. "
4,"I have been on Stashaway for over a quarter (3 - 4 months). Here is what I found.  Pros: - Really simple to use and start with only $100, I started with $1k and a monthly deposit of $100 - Very attractive management fees only a few dollars every month - Overall returns were good, at around 2% over that quarter. (Also, the rebalancing was interesting, with email reminders etc.) - I like the iOS app which allows me to track my investment performance on the go  Cons: - There was over 1.5 months where returns stagnated even dropped a little bit - This was mainly due to currency risk (as Stashaway invests in USD rather than SGD) - I think where you put your lump sum investment at the start really matters especially when I believe all SG investors in US markets would have been affected by the currency loss."
5,"Started using StashAway since early last year. I consistently invest monthly while keeping track of the portfolio price. I'll try to time the 'lowest point' for that month and invest that day morning to get the price I want when the company invest it on that same night. Have been a good simple strategy for me so far!  Feel free to sign up with my link and we'll both get up to $10,000 SGD managed for free for 6 months! bit.ly/2mTyTvL"
4,"Pros: - min. investment at $100 so anyone can start investing with robot.  - fractional shares: every single cent is being invested to make it all works for me.  - good rebalancing tactic, done twice a year with email reminders if investor wish to let robo auto rebalance or user manually do the rebalancing!  - actively engaging the public (talks and monthly cio updates article) - excellent customer support - nice and clean ui even more features now on the mobile apps - monthly statement now available via apps (like telco apps) - cheaper fee for a hassle free investment service that provides diversification (as compared to unit trusts/mutual funds)   cons: - more than 4 months where returns stagnated and dropped due to currency risk (as stashaway invests in usd rather than sgd) - no choice.  - asked cio personally that even with the most aggressive portfolio, they still allocate quite a significant portion to us treasury bonds as safety against any real bear market.  - they invest mostly in etf, basically follow the idea of warren buffet to bet in indexes rather than individual funds since no fund managers in the past 10 to 20 years has beaten the indexes, so even with the most aggressive portfolio, you're still quite safe. however, if you prefer higher returns, it is best to diy using value investing methods.  - higher fees than the rest of robo. "
5,"Pros: - Fractional shares: every single cent is being invested (make all your money work for you) - Investment framework which differentiates themselves from other robo-advisors (do spend some time to understand it, how the different regime would change the portfolio allocation, how is the portfolio being reoptimized/rebalanced) - Actively engaging the public (talks and monthly CIO updates article) - Excellent customer support - Nice and clean UI - The convenience of a mobile application - No minimum amount required to invest (event student drawing pocket money can do it!) - Cheap for a hassle free investment service that provides diversification (as compared to unit trusts/mutual funds and diversifying/rebalancing the portfolio yourself is not going to be cost-effective unless the amount is large)  Cons: - Limited visibility into the transactions in the UI (everything can be found in the monthly statement but that requires the user to wait a few weeks for it) - Exchange rate (SGD deposit to USD) cannot be found in the UI or monthly statement (this can be reversed/computed from the USD cash flow in the monthly statement)  Although I find the cons pretty annoying (could be just me), I believe the pros outweigh the cons, hence the 5 stars review. Not reviewing/commenting on the returns as I feel that it is too short/early to guage .  On a side note, I would like to share my observation (walk the talk) - I met up with the CEO of StashAway, Michele and asked if he has invested his own money. He immediately logged in and showed me his account. Not so much of a pros/cons but I thought it shows a lot :)"
4,"Been using StashAway since September 2018. I‚Äôve gotta say their UI is 10/10. It is clean, simple and easy to use. Instructions on how to make transfers are clear and concise.   Started off with 2 portfolios. 1st portfolio: Lump sum. 2nd portfolio: Initial lump sum with monthly $200 investment into the portfolio.   Been a good 7 months. The first portfolio generated a return of 2.3% in SGD. While the second portfolio generated a return of 8.5% in SGD.   IMHO, gold allocation is a little bit too high for slightly aggressive portfolios :(.   If you do not have time to manage your investments and would like to try robo advisory out, I would recommend StashAway."
5,"Been using this for the last 7 months and i'm up a solid 3% on a balanced portfolio. The free sessions they hold are great and they have performed consistently with low volatility as promised, no real complaints"
3,"I invested 10kusd in March 2018 in portfolio risk 28, still negative 0.5% today. I think better to do dollar cost averaging than invest 1 lump sum like me. "
5,"Stashaway was extremely easy to set up. They offer portfolios catering to different risk appetites, and tells you what the compositions of the different portfolios are. I like that the portfolios are well diversified. However, do note that most of what constitutes the portfolio are bought in USD, and there contains some currency risks!"
4,"Pros: - very simple to use, especially for those looking for hands-off experience - easy to deposit and withdraw, no issues faced - able to track performance via App - transparent fees structure - low minimum deposit - flexibility in one-time or regular investments - multiple options to manage risk appetite  Con: - USD currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting returns, especially in the short-term. should not be too big a deal in the long-term though"
5,I heard about StashAway long time back and they are one of the first few to get MAS approved license.  I didn't put my money with StashAway until I met Freddy at one of the events at SMU.  I like how they have a lot of session for education and the UI is nicely done. Statements and mobile app is top tier.
4,"Simple and easy to get started. For someone like me with little background, I could get started on investment with global exposure. The recent price drop was a pleasant entry for me."
2,"Stashaway is totally overpromising and underdelivering. The only good thing is the app which has great UX. I have been consistently losing money over the past year, despite using recommended settings. Don't believe there is a real solid algorithm behind this product."
5,"Tbh I chose StashAway from all the 3 due to the associated fees with respect to my monthly contribution amounts.  Set up was a breeze and way easier than axxx wxxxxx.   Their methodology  suits my preference, risk appetite and time I am willing to spend to gain overseas exposure.   I have not been disappointed so far, the returns are currently at an impressive 5.3% given that I only started in March 2018.   Overall, its an easy and relatively cheap way to gain overseas exposure.   Checking back in 10 years ;)   "
3,"I withdrawn all my $ recently from stashaway after 3 months. had a negative experience with the withdrawal. I requested for withdrawal when the annualized returns was about 2-3%, but then it did not reflect on my bank account after a few days.   after that i logged in and then requested for another withdrawal - and it was processed immediately because i emailed them. by then - the returns dropped to 1+%.   So basically, in 3 months, i put in 3k (1k once a month), and i got back $3010.81.   emailed them to clarify why wasnt my first withdrawal request processed - they said ""The reason why there is a slight difference in the amounts is because of the lead time."" i think because noone has withdrawn money yet so the process might be buggy.   so my overall experience (albeit short one) with them was slightly on the unpleasant side.   After which the team emailed me to clarify about the total returns. So definitely a plus point to the team in terms of customer service. However in terms of investment return, i believe there are better investment vehicles out there than roboadvisors. :)"
5,By far the best out of the lot. Running 5 different investment profiles ranging from 15 to 26. Average yield slightly more than a year iss 10%. Initially started with lump sum but now doing monthly contributions. Other 2 accounts with the next 2 popular robo investors is at 3.4% and 1.2%
5,"Deposited $200 2 weeks back. Up 5% now. Seems pretty good. I have stock investment about $140K stock & 80K unit trust from CPF. If Stashaway is available to invest from OA, I may shift all investment there"
3,"Regulated by MAS, simple to use and friendly user interface.  They take into consideration your risk profile.  Low cost, easy investing! "
4,"Been using for few months now, easy to view interface and more transparency of the FX rates used.. would recommend for newbies "
5,"Currently on my 3rd month with StashAway. Returns have been quite good at 2.4%. Although I'm a noob when it comes to investments, StashAway's easy-to-use app simplifies and visualises the necessary information for me.  If you are new to investments like me, StashAway would definitely be a great add-on to your portfolio."
5,"i have been using Stashaway for about 6 months now. the earnings from the first 6 months were alright (~1-2%), but they were quite fast in addressing my concerns when I enquired. Some money was lost due to the conversion rates, but they allow you to bank in USD now, so that should mitigate the currency fluctuations.  I also really like that they have an app which was quite easy to use to track the growth."
5,Just used for 2 months and starting to see some result. It's good for long term investment. And its app is work perfectly. 
5,I have seen many Fintech product and StashAway is a good one. User-friendly interface with comprehensive investment knowledge and experience backup. Great one ! 
3,"I personally am not a huge fan of StashAway due to   (1) Outsized allocation to US bonds (2) Opaque reoptimisation technique (""Economic Regime-based Asset Allocation‚Ñ¢"") (3) 30% withholding tax (4) Fees are on the high side  It's a great investment product if you like their asset allocation strategy and enjoy the convenience, but I probably will not be investing in this myself.  Full review at http://financialhorse.com/stashaway-1/  "
5,"Pros:  - Easy account setup - Very responsive customer support  - Low fees, and transparent - The app makes it so easy to 'babysit' your portfolios whenever you'd like to - Returns are really good. I started on Sep 2017 with risk 16 and then changed to 28 two months ago. The portfolio generates a 7.8% return in USD and 4.6% in SGD. There is no significant backward so far. Looking at the risk I'm taken, I'm exceptionally satisfied with the return.  Cons: - There is no way I can track the daily historical performance & return contribution of the ETFs in my portfolios.  - Nowhere I can find the USD/SGD exchange rate used to calculate assets performance in the app - It takes a bit long (3-5 days) to get money started investing in ETFs"
5,"User experience is really good. Mobile app and website are both clean and easy to use. Data visualization is excellent, so that users are able to understand the portfolio. I‚Äôm sure the product is developed by fantastic Developers."
5,"The biggest differentiator for me is the team and the people I trust my money with.  The team has outstanding experience across asset classes and economic cycles.  On the Product specifically, the user experience is phenomenal and the Android app allows easy access to your portfolio performance.  The integrity quotient is high with upfront disclosures on expectations, costs and how much time something will take.  That said I wish processing time on transactions was faster :) "
4,Pro: Does its job as a Robo-adviser. Con: Weak currency exchange (USD - SGD) will affect your returns.
4,"Been using since 2017.  Very clear breakdown of portfolio holdings. Has a friend referral program. Up to 28 levels of risk to modify your portfolio preferrence Low minimum investment amount required, $100 Has an accompanying app to monitor your investment "
5,"Started investing with StashAway since end of 2017 and I‚Äôm very pleased with their product and services, this is best for busy working adults as you do not need to keep monitoring your invested funds frequently, but if you do, you can always check from the nicely designed app."
5,It is easy to get yourself started due to its clean interface and clear instructions. It is user friendly and suitable for students or even newbies.
5,Currently investing via dollar-cost averaging with StashAway at $100 per month. Love the simplicity and diversification at affordable fees! Used a promo code so there'll be no fees for 6 months. Love the mobile app as it allows me to track and monitor my portfolio anytime on the go. Will make ad-hoc deposits should the market dip.
5,It's an easy platform to register and get started with. It's suitable for busy young students like me.
4,"Just started out with Stashaway, instructions were clear-cut and website/mobile app UI is smooth and user-friendly. Also the helpline staff were quick to response any questions that i've asked."
5,User friendly and easy to understand app for newbies like myself. Love it and will highly recommend to others!
5,"I joined stashaway since May 1st. It has been doing well so far despite the US-China trade war impact. Key things: MAS regulated, no minimum fund requirement, management fee between 0.2% to 0.8% annum. The average return differs from your personal portfolio, however it showld be between from 4% to 8%. Take away the mgmt fee, it is still 3% to 7%. They rely a lot on US Equities, so there are two things which will impact the overall performance. First is the US market, and the second is sgd to usd rate."
5,So far so good. Have started with Stashaway for about 5 months now and I gotta say the process is quick and updates honest and frequent. This gives me an easy way to get a global diversified exposure with my CPf SRS account!
5,Have been using it since their launch in Singapore. Every cents in there were clearly account for and no delay in fund purchase.  
5,"Simple and clean user interface. Informative, and easy to understand. Highly recommended for people starting to invest passively for the long term (>5 years)."
1,I use stashaway since February 2018. Average 15k SGD and so far the interests I had for a stashaway reccomanded risk profile are close to zero if not negative. If I left the same money in my bank I would have spent less in commissions and got more interests. Waste of expectations. Not reccomanded. 
4,"Easy to start with for beginners. 5 mths now and the return is about 5.6% with currency impact. Though, it does take awhile for them to receive fund, convert, then buy. And the web interface is kinda simplified too."
2,"I signed up with both AW and Stashaway but i eventually withdrawal all my money out from stashaway. Few reasons.   1) I started both, i prefer AW.   2) Initially i thought it is better i go with a fund manager (stashaway) instead of fund advisor (aw) because that allowed me to buy fractional share. But, then i think again after testing all the technology out there. I am really worried when their system is down, how all these fractional shares calculation is computed and who really own the shares. Hence, i prefer AW model where they are just helping me buy and rebalanced but i am still the one owning the etf in my saxo account. afterall they are brand-new startup, their technology are not proven yet. it is better i have my own trading account and you only help me manage.   3) i don't like simplified view of stashaway. too simplifed. i preferred to see daily/monthly report in different view eg returns, tranactions, add on etc.   4) all robo are usd...this is why i don't invest alot with anyone of them. I preferred sgd hedged esp usd has grew over 20% over the last few years and starting to fall. I bought unit trust in sgd hedged, return are the same after taking in consideration of usd drop.     "
5,"Just opened an account with StashAway. It was really simple, and the entire process took only 20 min. Hope to see returns from this robo advisor."
4,"Started on stashaway as it has no minimum investment amount,  so decided to give it a try as well.   Not much returns since Nov 17( going for long term returns,  will wait and see) . Has an app which has easy access. Frequent updates by stashaway regarding the market changes.  Has to take the MAS test to go for higher risk portfolio. Detailed portfolio showing everything from investment amounts of each ETF and dividends.  Showed both returns of in terms of USD and SGD after currency impact  ( not for autowealth) "
5,"great earnings and stable platform, hope to see implementation of 2FA for added security."
5,Great product.  I like the simple interface which tells me the information I look for e.g. portfolio returns easily. 
5,"I was one of the first batch of customers for StashAway. I really liked their idea and joined their wait list before the product was even launched. After half a year i still like them, because it‚Äôs smart enough to optimise on my behalf and on the other hand flexible enough. Their customer service is also a big plus point! I would say it‚Äôs a really good choice to include in your portfolio.  "
5,Gamechanger robo adviser investment fund. Co founders with diverse background and solid professional experience sets StashAway different from many others. A must follow and should consider for any savvy investors!
5,"Been using both StashAway and Smartly for half a year now. It's been really easy to set-up and use! Very responsive and anticipate your goals and need! Thou, Smartly been giving better returns, we'll see about it in the long run when the economy turns. At the end of the day. Diversify! "
4,"Stashaway is a simple, elegant and effective investment solution for an individual's investment needs / goals. It is also probably the only roboadvisor in Singapore that does more than being ""robotic"" and just ""mindlessly"" taking individuals' money and passing on to the ETFs managers and making a fee in return... Stashaway's Economic Regime-based asset allocation framework will probably shine through over the long run, especially now when we have seen mulitple years of good markets.. in the next downturn, their asset allocation strategy will probably protect investors' capital much better than other platforms that are static in their asset allocation.. "
5,"This is a very good way for investors to diversify their portfolio in US base ETF without having to go to any bank FSM or other financial services that charge exorbitant fees. There‚Äôs no research to be done, no Excel files to tinker with, nothing. You can put in say, a hundred buckaroos a month and have it instantly diversified into thousands of stocks and bonds worldwide.  Literally set-it-and-forget-it investing.  If you‚Äôre prepared to stick with them for the long-term, robo-advisors can offer a much better alternative compared to investing in overpriced unit trusts or ILPs.  Robo-advisors get economies of scale by getting everyone to invest in the same ETF. So while you can select your allocation between each ETF, you can‚Äôt include or exclude ETF.  StashAway wrote a nice rebuttal of the withholding tax issue here saying that it doesn‚Äôt really affect returns. However, I‚Äôm not entirely convinced and I‚Äôd like to see that analysis applied across more ETFs and asset classes. For example, bond ETFs tend to be more affected by the tax given that their dividends comprise a bigger proportion of their returns."
5,Great product.  Interface is awesome and I can tell my portfolio returns quite easily.  I also like how they have a mobile friendly website which enables me to surf on the phone.
5,The user-interface is excellent and user-friendly. I managed to find the information i was looking for rather easily.
5,"I like the simplicity provided in the portfolio construction. As a working professional, it allows me to start investing without spending too much time."
5,Ease of use is great. The Platform provides me exactly with the freedom and flexibility i need for my investments.
5,Great platform! Efficient and what online investors really need! Cost efficient. Clear and easy tracking. Unlikely to use other platforms for now.
5,"To person with zero investment knowledge like me, it provides me with a hassle-free way to kick start my investment. It is easy to track my investment performance too."
5,"Very user-friendly platform. From an overall portfolio management perspective, its important to get some diversification via US-focused ETFs"
5,"Pros:  +Very nice and clean user interface which makes it very intuitive +Backed by a very strong team, including industry veteran Freddy Lim & Michele Ferrario +Quick and efficient processing +Automated portfolio optimization Cons: -Unable to change investment plan once it is set up"
5,"Terrific product. I've been a customer now since Stashaway launched and am very happy. Great investment strategy, customer support, and follow-up. Strong and trusted team. "
5,"Very simple and clean, yet still informative, platform interface and portfolio reports. Also like the portfolio construction methodology which they share on their website. Seems dynamic and well thought out. All weather!"
5,very sophisticated framework to position macro regimes and professional team behind the investment process and risk management
5,"No minimum lock in period and no minimum deposit to start, user friendly app lead by top veterans in the market. A great way for you to start saving! "
5,"Great way to invest without minimum commitment nor lock-in period. Hassle-free.  A little recommendation on the app: It would be more intuitive for me to see all my assets under the ""asset"" tap, including all line charts and pie charts and breakdowns, instead of clicking again on a specific portfolio under header - ""performance and holding"". As I would have clicked on a specific portfolio under tab ""portfolios"" to view the performance / holdings of a certain portfolio."
5,"very friendly and helpful staff, heshang, definitely a good investment method "
5,"Undoubtedly the most impressive and sophisticated product on the market, lead by top industry veterans. Taking robo-advising to a whole new level."
5,Best way to save money and easy to withdraw. Definitely a five star.
5,So easy to use! Makes me wonder why I need to listen to an hour of ETF selling from an agent when this system chooses the best result for me
5,"I highly recommend the portfolio constructed. It is easy to use, low-cost and allows me to tap on growing market upside without compromising on the risk protection! "
5,I highly recommend StashAway. They combine professional investing personalized to your profile along with a very pleasant user experience and full transparency at a very low cost. Great job at making smart investing simple and affordable for everyone!
5,The platform is really easy to use! Competitive fees.
5,"Whereas traditional asset allocation assumes consistent relationships between asset classes over time, Stashaway takes a much smarter approach. By anlayzing macro regimes and considering how cross asset relationships vary from one regime to another, portfolio construction becomes more risk-efficient. I really appreciate this nuanced view of cross asset relationship regimes, and the extra mile Stashaway goes to provide its clients with a solution at this level of sophistication. Not your average investment advisor!"
5,"Bespoke portfolio manager at my fingertips.  STASHAWAY is calibrated to give unparalleled variety of investment options with retained flexibility over regular trades to longterm investments. It does not require complex knowledge and you learn along the way. What is important for me is online security and the platform provides the licensing transparency to make me feel comfortable with the transactions and the protection of my private data. Dashboard is easy to navigate, while data stream is virtually lagfree. Quick customer service response. Safe transaction protocols. I am won!"
5,I have been using the platform for a while. It is Super user friendly and convenient! Also I don‚Äôt have to worry too much about how my funds are being invested. Fantastic especially for defensive investors
5,Super nice platform and the tech support is incredible! Diversified investments for the win!
5,Super safe and reliable team! Platform is also easy to use!
5,I like how they make it easy for me to invest via their platform. Returns are good and will keep invested given their customer service .
5,"I was new to this, but easy to navigate and understand! Good platform to a diversified portfolio with reasonable cost."
5,Great team! Only robo advisory that has full fledged MAS Cap Markets license. Money is in segregated account. Safe to invest! 
5,its the safest and intelligent investing platform in the region
5,Been on the platform for close to a year. Easy to undertsand and transparent.
5,"StashAway has a very intuitive and easy-to-use interface. Customer support has been very patient and helpful whenever you call them (during working hours of course).  The return is very impressive so far. Transactions, trades and fee charge are all transparent as in you will receive a monthly statement."
5,"I really like StashAway as it is making investing easy, simple and most importantly low cost. Set it and forget it. Brilliant service. "
5,"Very happy with returns so far. Interface easy to use. Doing monthly deposits, and will continue to do so."
5,"Invested since July 2017 and currently have a 5.8% return in SGD, 10.8% in USD.   The interface is clean, intuitive and easy to understand. The addition of the iOS app makes it great for checking my portfolios while on the go.  Happy to invest with a team that has such broad experience, which makes me feel better about the safety of assets. Customer service is very fast. They have a large team, which makes me confident that they are here to stay. Also good that they got the most difficult to achieve MAS license.  Haven‚Äôt had any issues with depositing or withdrawing assets. Typically seems to get done within T + 1 or T + 2, depending on what time they receive the transfer. Was told that it should will be getting faster as they streamline the process."
5,"Been investing via Stashaway for a few months now. I don‚Äôt have time to actively manage my money and returns from putting the money in the bank are too Low. Highly recommend them, hassle free experience. Returns are decent for a hands off investor.    My understanding is that of all the startups in this space, Stashawy is the only one that has taken the trouble to get a proper MAS license to manage investment funds. My understanding is this means they need to meet much more stringent capital and compliance requirements compared to the other startups in this space which only have ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù with MAS licensed entities.   When the s**t hits the fan, I would be more inclined to think that an MAS licensed entity would have a lower probability of running away with my money and or doing the right thing to return investor money. "
5,Great company that made me start thinking about properly investing my savings without paying huge standard bank fees. User experience is world class.
5,"Very strong product. Newly released app has great UX and provides great clarity on the overall investment situation.  Investment strategy, low fees and easiness to use make it my favorite choice! "
4,Been using StashAway for a couple of months. The returns are pretty reasonable given the minimal level of effort required from the user. Here are my views:-  Pros:- - User friendly interface - Easy setup - Low fees  Cons:-  - High USD exposure
5,"I've been investing through StashAway for about 6 months. It was my first investment and of course (and thankfully), no investment knowledge was needed - StashAway does a good job for you and I am very satisfied with the return rate so far. Mobile App is also useful so I can check the balance anytime, anywhere. Plus, their customer service is very responsive and informative. "
5,"The solution I have been looking for for ages. A set it and forget it investment strategy. Automatic rebalancing, diversified portfolio, everything I want!"
5,"1) Easy to understand data (portfolio breakdown chart, graph for investments and returns clearly stated) 2) Smooth user onboarding (step-by-step guide from setting up investment goals to transfering the money) 3) Transparency - Regular updates whenever there are changes"
5,"Easy to understand and use product, appreciate the good user interface and the outreach the company is doing to help educate us on basic financial literacy, savings and investing. Generally fuss free so far.  Disclosure: I am a beta tester and have been invested in Stashaway since day 1; while there have been a couple of kinks in the beginning the team was always on hand to address concerns / issues."
5,"It‚Äôs the easiest way I found to invest, have a great diversification, not spent time thinking about it (thus I can focus more on making new business, which is always better than thinking forever about saving 10cts), and yet have low cost doing all this. In short: great for most people."
4,"Pros: - Minimum amount to start ($100) - Like their UI/UX of the app  Cons: - There was a drop in returns due to currency, causing my return to be negative - Updating of personal details can be inflexible at times (e.g changing home address etc)"
5,User-friendly interface. Great projection visuals to help the average user map out where his/her money will take them in x amount of years.
5,Very easy-to-use product to invest your money with a thorough and solid investment framework at unbeatable low fees.  I trust the team to manage my money like their own.
5,"Most professional Robo-team in SEA, great product, fast, professional and responsive customer service, good risk to gain ratio. Faster than banks with good returns."
5,"Trust in the team, simplicity of interface, and a great biz idea behind!"
4,"Signed up for Smartly & StashAway, and deposited cash funds for investment on the 9th.   Smartly - Deposits received on 10th morning, auto invested into ETFs on 10th night. (Because NYSE market open 9:30am US time = 10:30pm SG time)  StashAway - Deposits received only on the 11th morning, not yet invested into anything yet as of now 11:20pm.   I would say StashAway has a downside in this aspect, longer waiting time for funds to be invested after deposit (more concerned for those with recurring deposits like monthly or quarterly etc.)"
4,"Good for Investors who are starting out and don‚Äôt know how to manage a balanced portfolio. They will structure and manage a portfolio for you, which is a long term strategic allocation that reacts according to economic data.  Personal Advice: Do not pull all your eggs into one basket. Even though StashAway invest your monies in multiple ETF with a good asset class allocation. Your largest risk is with still with StashAway itself.  Pros: - Easy to start (on boarding) investment - Easy to track portfolio via available mobile apps - Low and transparent fee structure  - Configurable risk appetite which matches a suitable portfolio asset allocation - Multiple options for one-time investments or regular investments  Cons: -  USD Currency exposure i.e. investments are converted to USD before investing via the US markets although actual investment exposure is not only in US companies - No options to select/ opt-out of certain ETF or equity - Only for mid-long term investments     "
4,"- Intuitive and easy to use platform which is the whole point of a robo-advisor to provide hassle free investing. - Transparent in terms of the information provided on where the money is invested and rebalancing of asset allocation. - Returns wise too early to tell but the ERAA concept seems interesting. - Personally, I think that risk levels should be adjusted automatically when nearing end of investment timeline such as nearing retirement age if investing for retirement."
4,"Pros:  - Fully digitalised experience, no need to even meet up with any personnel  - Platform is simple to use and easy to construct. I have 2 portfolios now and it is simple to add on additional portfolios for different purposes. - Liquidity is fantastic, money is not locked in meaning instead of opening another account to park my funds, i can park everything here and withdraw within 2 working days or so   Cons: - Not as comprehensive in terms of detailing the injection of funds (as compared with Auto Wealth) - Currency risk can have a huge impact on returns & fx rate used not clear  Haven't withdrawn any funds so unable to give 5 stars   Unable to comment on returns as I have one portfolio purely for wealth preservation so to me as long as it beats 1% per annum (vs CIMB FastSaver w/o conditions ) I am good with it. So far its 0.8% total returns for HY  The other portfolio is newly set up and hence inappropriate for comments."
3,"Have used since Oct 17. Pro: - send an email on monthly statement, monthly market outlook and seminars (if any) - pleasant and straight forward user interface - Most of the queries are in FAQs. They can be contact via calls and email which they will respond within a day. - low management fee  Cons: - Unable to withdraw $USD unlike autowealth - Unable to view what is their foreign exchange rate they use  Investor has to take in consider of the management fee and exchange rate (SGD to USD & USD to SGD).  "
4,"I've been using Stashaway for about a quarter (since Sep 2017). Overall I think this is a fantastic product for someone who wants exposure to a diversified portfolio of global ETFs through a DCA method with minimal effort, and who doesn't want to lock in your money. Definitely recommended. I'll upgrade this to 5 stars when the ability to deposit and withdraw USD becomes available.  Pros: - very user friendly interface, especially the mobile app. fun fact: i opened my account when commuting home on a bus! - full transparency of information. you can see exactly where each dollar (or cent) goes - your money is not locked in, you can adjust your monthly contribution or withdraw anytime - CIO insights on the global economic situation a nice bonus and very well written - sound investment strategy with good exposure to global ETFs - good customer service with prompt and clear response  Cons: - prompt to start with a lump sum runs counter to the DCA strategy and magnified currency risk - inability to deposit USD (was informed this is something we will see H1 2018)"
4,"Started using since December 2017 so I'm still a relatively new user. What I like is: they will inform you about re-optimisation, site is easy to navigate, monthly statements through email and the gain/loss net of currency movements. However as I have not done much else such as withdrawals, I'm giving it a 4 stars"
5,"Switched over from Singtel and I never once had to call customer service to troubleshoot any issue for the last 3 years, unlike using Singtel's broadband where holding 30 mins on the hotline is a monthly affair. Keep up the good work MyRepublic!"
1,Regretted my recontracting decision. Internet wasn't as fast as they claim it to be. Worst still is that they don't notify you when your contract ends and you are expected to pay higher. 
5,"I have been a subscriber for over 3 years and has not experienced any issue with the service.   You know a broadband service is good when you never had to think about it at all. It's just there, always."
5,"I have my republic broadband for more than 2 years. Reliable service, no major issues so far.   The application process was easy and straightforward. When there are issues, the customer service promptly answer our questions. My Republic also notifies customer in advance when maintenance is conducted and risk of service disruption is faced. My Republic offers competitive price with excellent services compared to other brands. It deserves an award as customer choice: value for money.   P. S. During peak hour, some areas in the house receive weak wifi signal. However this can be solved by deploying a wifi repeater. "
2,You technical/service support staffs need some kind of a wake up call... Some sounds uninterested in helping while some needs to go for service orientation course.... Product quality so far has been good probably needs to look again into the pricing matters as it is quite on the steep side....
5,"After since using MyRepublic broadband for more than 5 years, I love their internet speed and their plan is in affordable range. It doesn't cause much problems.  Their packages items are much better other brands company, which is quite useful for different people needs."
2,"There is no issue with your broadband service. But your customer service for mobile phone suck big time.  I refer to your case number #562930 in Jan 2019. Your customer service officer, Mark was shouting at me on the phone.  The case was indeed wrong on MyRepublic‚Äôs end who canceled my mobile service without my knowledge. And there was no case follow up on my complaint. It simply buried by your staff.   Since the incident, I swear i will not continue any of your plan once it expire. To be frank, MyRepublic has the worst customer service I experienced."
5,"This is my 4th year with My Republic. I just re-contract my home broadband service. What does this tell? Lol. I am a very satisfied customer, believing that My Republic can provide the best for my broadband needs. 2 thumbs up. Thank you My Republic."
5,I have been using MyRepublic Fibre Broadband for many years and there is no turning back to me as product reliability has been tip top. Internet speed is insanely fast with low latency and so i suggest you  invest in AAA class router to get the most out of the internet speed you sign up to.  Last but not least... remember to fasten your seatbelt :- )
5,Overall the service & connectivity is good and great. The only issue i'd was too call the hotline for help. I'd to wait very long to get to the operator.  And payment for my monthly bills. As I'm a person who like to pay direct and not by deduction through bank. If they can improve on the method of payment it will be great and convenient.  So far I'd not issue or disruption with myrepublic.  Thanks for the services. 
3,"Broadband still good, but not for the mobile line... After recontract, when making calls using mobile phone,almost every calls having distortion and tech team not helping anything at all... Broadband connection are not as great compare to before i recontract.. Coz its cheap, so don't expect all to be good...at least broadband still worth it for the price.. "
2,"Just renewed my contract. Selected the Asus Laptop bundle. Very disappointed, I was informed to wait 1 and 1/2 months to receive it after making payment. Wasn't informed of this ""long"" wait prior to renewing contract. Was told the faster I paid the amount, the faster I will get the laptop. üëéüëé "
1,Would give a zero star if I could.   Stay away from these guys.  They are disorganized and poorly ran.   Better service providers out there.  
4,"The service itself is decent and speeds are fast. However, when something happens and service fails for some reason, it can be next to impossible to find a representative to talk to without holding a line for at least an hour, since all the online chat representatives are never really available when needed. Also, their accompanying mobile offerings now pale in comparison (not to mention having an extremely confusing lineup) to the competition. "
5,Worth switching from the previous internet service provider to MyRepublic. I saved quite abit on my internet bills. 
5,Been using MyRepublic Wifi got 2 years now. Speed is fast and importantly its cheap and reliable. Bills are hassle-free easy to pay. Technician are fast to respond and friendly. Great service. Recommended to subscribe!  
5,"I have been using myrepublic since it started. The best service I have used so far. Recently, I applied a phone line. Honestly, I have saved quite alot on my bills eversince.  The only downside is that its hard to apply a phone with line.  Overall, the best service in Singapore"
5,"Reliable internet. Will recommend for existing or new home owners. Had an issue once, called service helpline and issue was resolved promptly"
5,It is fast and wallet friendly. The download speed is lighting fast. Would reccomend it to others. Kudos to the service provider.
4,It is fast and wallet friendly. The download speed is lighting fast. Would reccomend it to others. Kudos to the service provider.
5,"I have been using my Republic WiFi all this time and,cheap, fuss free payment, no need to worry about bill, or speed. I can say that I'm highly satisfied with the service provided.will highly recommend to my friends, family and colleagues. #thankyoumyRepublic#"
5,I have 4 accounts with MyRepublic. My experience with MyRepublic is good.  I would like to share with you 1 incident happened.   I overlooked on the outstanding bill and my daughter line was cut off. N I couldn't contact her. She is 9years old. I called Myrepublic whether can help me reconnect the line ASAP as I'm worried about my daughter. They reconnect soon after 1hr.  Fuh... At last I'm able to contact my daughter. She is safe.  Thank you Myrepublic. 
5,Great connection.  Value for money Monthly bill payment fuss free Don‚Äôt need to be put on hold to talk to a person. 
5,Great service with affordable price. Wifi connection is stable and there is no problem since day one. Customer Service officer always ready and friendly to assist us. Definitely recommend myrepublic!
5,"I've been using MyRepublic for several years now and never looked back. A few of us in the family game and the router and value of the plan is probably one of the best.   Although MyRepublic has a service centre within walking distance of our home, to be honest their platform to manage your subscription is really convenient so there's almost no reason to have to go down in person. You can upgrade/amend your plan any time. The one time we did pop down to renew our contract and ask some questions however, we've been very pleased with their customer service. The staff was incredibly attentive and helpful. Because their online platform is great, there was no line, which made for an incredibly efficient experience."
5,"MyRepublic Broadband user since 2012. No throttle speeds during peak hours, no slowdown when streaming/downloading during peak hours. Have great trust in their customer support as well!"
5,"Since the change from orange colour provider to MyRepublic customer more than 4 years ago, I have never looked back. For the fibre broadband, There are no problems when downloading and uploading and there is minimal lag when streaming online. The free internet phone line is also great and add-on for value added services is easy to use. A v satisfied customer! Thank you MyRepublic."
1,"Always put to live chat, cannot get any help.  Bank account used by MyRepublic for unauthorised transactions, charged service fee weekly, not taking any responsibilities for the discrepancy "
4,"Used MyRepublic for about 3-4 years already. Wifi connection has been pretty stable, only once in awhile I get connection issue but it is no problem and just needed to reboot. My desktop uses cable connection, and it has been stable with comfortable speed."
5,Great network.  Value for money contract prices.  Downtime is well informed earlier and usually in the dead of the night so no disruptions!
5,Good network at affordable prices. 97% free of downtime for the past 4 years with them. Scheduled maintenance are in wee hours and never extended.
5,Used MyRepublic for about 3 years. Wifi connection has fast and stable. Been thinking of getting the Mobile plan soon. 
4,"Used MyRepublic for about 3-4 years already. Wifi connection has been pretty stable, only once in awhile I get connection issue but it is no problem and just needed to reboot. My desktop uses cable connection, and it has been stable with comfortable speed, enough to be downloading and gaming at the same time (1 Gbps plan).  "
5,been using broadband  for almost 4 yrs and for mobile 2 yrs.so far everything is helpful and no problem.
5,Nice service. The speed is really fast and stable after I switch to MyRepublic and It's easy to install a new WIFI router with no password needed. I love it.
5,"Never had any issues with MyRepublic in more than 5 years with them, That's why I recommended their service with my friends. I'm also using MyRepublic mobile since day 1."
4,"Currently using the broadband service provided by Myrepublic. There are times where connection is quite slow eventhough the modem is just right beside me. Myrepublic should look into this. Other than that, service is good. Their customer service officers are always helpful.  Thanks!"
4,MyRepublic connection is stable and smooth.  Would strongly recommend to switch over but would be better if there is more promo
5,Slow connectivity when gaming or live streaming entertainment  especially with multiple users at same time...nah..no longer got this problems...internet speed mostly Optimal! No regret switching over! Customer services has improved. Keep it up!  Competition is high! 
5,Reliable ISP and np problem with myrepublic so far.  Speeds don't seem to get throttled at any time. Great and keep it up. Have recommended to my friends too. 
4,"Switched to MyRepublic 1 year ago from Company S which I have been using for 10 over years, I should have switch earlier :D  Connection was smooth and no issues for me so far.   Would love to see more promo in future."
5,Swift and smooth processing time with MyRepublic. T&C was shared clearly for better understanding on their service.  installation and instruction on deco device promptly advise.  No regret.
4,"I have been with MyRepublic 1Gbps Fibre for probably 4 years already.  On the whole, no major concerns.   Just that the speed I get is never close to 1Gbps.  Based on speedtests, its averaging below 30Mbps"
5,"My Republic has been offering value for money Fibre Broadbands as compare to the other service providers, I pay lesser with faster speed and better control of my broadband and I been using almost near to 4 years with them after they launch the fibre broadband. üëçüèª Great MyRepublic. "
5,"I have been with MyRepublic for around 3 years now, after having moved over from Singtel. In these 3 years, I've moved, and it was easy to get a dude from MyRepublic to come over to my new place to help set things up. From there, I basically didn't have to think about the broadband service at all, and it's become a fixture of sorts - to the point that you can even take it for granted. Worry/frustration-free experience! And it's economical to boot!"
5,Its been more than 2 years I subscribe with My Republic. Customer service were friendly and helpful. All my enquiries were answered promptly. Definitely will recommend My Republic to people out there
2,"CS kinda triggered my patience that makes me terminate my Mobile line. However, I still maintain my Broadband as I still believe MyRepublic can improve. For now, I stick to Broadband till they Improve  "
4,"Helpful staff and pleasant experience when recontracting the fiber plan and even managed to get a good deal on the staff's recommendation.  Signed up for a mobile plan as well, and network quality is great.  Recommended for new users who wanna try out their services.."
4,The fibre broadband has fairly stable. No noticeable drop in speed. Although the upgrade of router didn‚Äôt seem to help in terms of range and I live in a new BTO 3-rm flat with the router placed at my tv console nearer to the dining area. 
5,"Ever since I subscribed to MR Fibre Broadband, it has worked perfectly for me and my family. Their customer service was not great initially but has made vast improvements. Promotions and offers related to subscribers should also be extended to family members. "
4,"Well, nothing and no one should be perfect, so 4 stars because there's always things to improve on!! But truth be told, it is difficult for me to actually find avenues for MyRepublic to beef up on because thus far, my experience with their Broadband and affiliated services have been nothing but a joy.   Why? Not just because everything works -- and yes, everything does work seamlessly... However, in my opinion, the secret sauce that makes a good ISP a great one is how they handle problems. I mean look, everyone expects to get high speed internet service from any ISP out there in the marketplace. That's what we're subscribing and paying for. So while I've been through a few providers in the past (I mean, let's be honest, there weren't that many options at the beginning), thus far... no ISP possesses the customer oriented and ease-of-problem-solving prowess of MyRepublic.   Signing up was a breeze. Setting up was easy and quick. Communications, invoicing, the smartphone app access all made using MyRepublic's service really easy. But their customer service takes the cake:   Their telephone customer service truly deserves to be applauded: a person actually answers the phone! Not a answering machine! It's a human! You get to immediately speak to a human being, and you get your issue or question answered in a snap! Sometimes isn't all we really want is just to quickly get in touch with someone to ask something real quick? To me, that was customer service icing on the cake! You don't know what a joy it is to be able to reach someone who can help you without having to navigate through a maze of having to press ""1"" or ""2"" on the phone to reach different departments when all u want is just to talk to a friendly service specialist.  Another nugget of joy: I actually feel like a true valued customer when they send you emails to get the first look at all their new promos and services!      'Nuff said, its (almost) perfect, everything works flawlessly, and I love the customer service. Really can't ask for more! #awesome."
5,Services provided is above expectation as compared to other competitor. Issue reported was resolved promptly. Keep up the good job!
3,"Generally fast on most days, occasionally slow during unexpected time.  Had issue with the connection couple weeks back and it took them almost 2 weeks to resolve it, after several follow up they finally managed to fix it.   Customer service was quite responsive however the technician that handle the on site assessment considerably careless, he almost left router and terminal disconnected -- I reminded him to get everything back to its place prior to leaving.  "
4,"I find Myrepublic plan quite competitive and the customer service line is easier to call in, whenever there is a disconnection. The customer service staff always tries their best to solve my problem and called back promptly. So far, the connection has been pretty  good :)"
1,recently i have some technical issues. i called the hotline and was holding for more than 35 minutes. still there was no one answering the call. i was so frustrated that i had to hang up!!! more than 35 minutes of holding is not acceptable at all.
4,"It's generally fast and reliable on most days. Sometimes the traffic on weekends and peak days tend to slow down but that is to be expected.  I do believe they are doing the best they can and have some of the friendliest customer service, in my own opinion."
3,There are too many hidden fees that are not told to the customer upfront. The person who installed it came late. Inflexible timings offered for people who are working. I had to take leave just to wait around for someone to come set it up.
5,"I was recommended by my daughter who subscribed to MyRepublic for her new home and I found it very suitable because of its good signal at a reasonable price. So, all the process was done by authorised partner of MyRepublic including my termination from existing Service Provider with friendly care and responsible. I am highly recommended to others and this is my most honest feedback...... becos MyRepublic had reduced my monthly bill for broadband, me and my wife handphone more than 50% per month. Regards,"
5,Prompt and value-add customer service is the key factor to our continual renewed subscription.  Keep up the good work!
4,So far so good i have been with them since year 2016 till now and i have re-contract with them twice service and staff are there to help me on query. I have recommend to friends and relative.
5,"I renewed by subscription with MyRepublic, it was an easy an seamless process at the IT Show. Surprisingly I also got $50 vouchers, wow! Either way I was going to renew my subscription as the network has been relatively stable and reliable for me and my family. "
5,So far its been months using the republic..which i don't have an issue... hope its maintain the quality like this...
5,So far so good no problem at all.Great but uope for more freebie.if got money all sign up all their plan and get more discount.
5,"Going to end my first 2yrs of contract soon and its an easy decision to extend a further 2yrs with MyRepublic.no lag,no disruption and friendly customer service."
5,"Was shopping at Vivocity and got attracted by the road show and signed up on the spot for Fibre home. Counter staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Installation was spot on as well, and technical installation guy was patient and friendly in explaining on the setup although he was drenched in sweat.  Overall, been using since June 2019 and have no problem so far.  So much better than the big red umbrella which I was on previously.  Thumb up!"
2,Long time waiting for the install service... 9 terrible days after registration in store. They told me it would take 7 days and phoned me on the 6th day to postpone. That cost me a lot of the data fee during those days. And the staff delayed and didn't arrive at home on time.
5,I have been with them for the past 3 years and it was good. Their call centre was very helpful in breakdown situation at my home and very friendly. 
5,"Been on MyRepublics broadband since early this year. So far, so good. Wanted to sign for their mobile too, but still on the high-side. Cheers!"
5,The transition process was smooth and hassle-free. Everything runs pretty well after that. No complaints.
5,I have been a MyRepublic broadband subscriber since it started. Technical support is great and they get back to you very fast. So far no lag when online as compared to other that I had used. I recommended my friends to MyRepublic and no regrets. Now I am also their mobile subscriber too. 
4,"I believe I am one of the pioneers (more than 8 years) with MyRepublic broadband.  Good speed, hardly any downtime.  I even recommended my Company to take up broadband for apartments because there is no contract and can terminate anytime without penalty."
4,Been using MyRepublic since 2015 and everything is good so far!  The technical support provided was prompt and impressive. Managed to  resolve our problems from their back end when we called through their hotline. They even offered us practical solutions to improve the stability of our internet connection.  Good job!
4,"Been with republic for over four years. Overall is a good experience. Just that even with a good router like HALO, master bedroom have connectivity issues, i try placing my router need the middle of living room but still not very helpful. Been using a AC passthru and luckily able to fix the connectivity issues."
4,I've been using their broadband for almost a year or 2.. Connections are fine... Just that sometimes the connecting takes a little longer to start.. Besides that..everything this is fine with the broadband. 
4,"Been using MyRepublic Dual 1Gbps for over 2 years now. No issues so far. their maintenance schedule is quite regular and the downtime is relatively short.  now i wish their latency is lower overall. which can give them a significant edge over the other ISPs. in general, most ISPs have a latency of 200ms to servers overseas. (i have used both Singtel and Starhub in the past) I use cable connections, not wifi.  although there is the gamer package, those are limited to game servers listed on their webstore. the games i play are the less common ones, thus the 200ms latency is annoying since it causes desyncs for me.  Reducing the latency for General users to 150ms or lower would be ideal.  especially since there's a game relaunching for North America servers next year. and it would help with other games that have less than ideal servers like Ubisoft's Uplay."
5,The most stable fibre broadband by far. Maintenance sessions are planned while keeping consumers well informed. Please keep up the good stuff!
5,"Good speed! Stability. Rarely a downtime, I don't remember if there's ever one. Promotion for re-contract seems attractive. "
5,MyRepublic‚Äôs consistently high speed and bandwidth connectivity are hard to find today where you see ISPs apologising frequently for connection downtime or customers complaining about slow speeds..
5,I be using this broadband for few month....im happy with their service a great choice and price really worth...so far i dun have any issues with the broadband or e service side when i need their help.. thank Q myrepublic & keep it up  (Azahar Tahar)
5,Myrepublic is the cheapest and affordable wifi broadband there is! Been using it for about 3 years and so far still good! Fast and reliable speeds. 
5,I be using this broadband for 2yr....im happy with their service as every yr i change my plan with a great choice and price really worth...so far i dun have any issues with the broadband or e service side when i need their help.. thank Q myrepublic & keep it up
2,"The 1st 2 years was very good, contract lapsed and didn't recontract for awhile. After recontracting with a new modem, the connection was REALLY bad. Couldn't get a stable connection in the master bedroom and can't even watch YouTube on TV in the living room. Prior to changing it was working perfectly fine most of the times. "
5,"Thus far, Myrepublic has a very good customer service/service recovery. Network is okie. Can't really tell the different. Was another service provider user before changing it to Myrepublic. "
5,"While with previous provider, connection see to drop off and always worry abt speed and connectivity. After the change, no problems at all and best of all... wife is happy. Best of all, Paying the same as what is was paying. "
4,So far so good. I have not much complain for this fibre service. Other than its fluctuating monthly bills. But the difference is not much. Few dollars diff every month. Sometimes more. Sometimes less. 
5,Very fast internet speed compare to other service providers.  Maintainance is always in the wee hours which does not disturb usage in the day. Friendly and considerate customer service staffs in Vivo City outlet.
4,"Fuss-free online interface, stable service with no interruptions nor disruptions, competitive pricing and timely updates and reminders of recontracting. Keep it up!"
4,"Using their broadband and mobile service, so far so good. constantly updating their plans to be competitive with the other telco."
5,It is not of the best providers.  It is the best providers!  I'm a gamer with zero lag!  Every one's dream come true.keep up the awesome work! 
4,This is my 3rd years with my republic  fiber boardband  and after re contract I just noticed Singtel having better offer with same package due to I‚Äôm a Singtel mobile user. If I sign up with Singtel I have more benefits than my republic. So far I have no complaint with the my republic boardband. 
3,"Great internet and good service....until you decide to leave then they make your life difficult. Also not very professional with the spelling mistakes, even as I write this review for 3 stars it says ""It was average, I might use it agin"".... All in all it is a good attempt to be a top tier service provider, but it could be better."
5,I am a happy user for My Republic. Always stay connected and never we face any issue connecting to wifi. Customer service was good and helpful when i call to change on my email address for the billing. I have been using My Republic for 4 over years and I am glad that I choose My Republic. Overall its a thumbs up service an staying connecting all day long ! 
5,"It is going into my 3rd year with My Republic and I must say I am totally pleased. I have noticed there were outages with other service providers but My Republic kept chugging along.  I have had no issue even when maintenance is going on, I had been connected. Keep up the good work and hope that our mutual support will go on for a long while to come."
5,Been 4yrs plus with MyRepublic...nothing to complain about...maintenance was done without any interruption as it was done at night...very much recommended...üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
5,So far no problem and the internet is fast and reliable. customer service is great! the best provider ever!
5,Honestly just hands down the best ISP I've used over the past 10 years. Almost 0 down time and 99% of the time. Especially with the gaming bundle... Its just really good. Would recommend MY Republic to anyone. 
5,"One of the best experience i have had so far, compared to the rest of the telco that tend to make me think that i am not important at all, they reduced my mobile monthly fee just cos i am a home fibre subscriber also without me having to ask for it.  I will always stick to myrepublic."
2,Please put more professional People to assist on customer  If put on hold and difficult To ask take time about the payment bill please try to do on sam machine also less trouble my republic need to upgrade on custoler service.  Thank 
5,Its been more than a year i have subscribed to My Republic Home Broadband and Mobile. No problems at all. Keep up the good worküëç
5,"I switched over to My Republic around when they first began to offer fibre broadband, 1GB at a decent price compared to my previous telco. Their service has been great, only once did we have an outage and when  we called them a real person answered the phone and promptly transferred us to a technician who was able to troubleshoot the problem for us over the phone. We were reconnected within 30 mins."
5,My Republic broadband has been with me for 3 yrs and honestly  i got no issues  with that line.  Certain  faulty  not from myrepublic its cause  from different  resources. Im happy  that myrepublic has been  a great  broadband  to me.  Bills got no issue.  
5,"The broadband package was really competitive and worth it as compare to other service providers. The connection and speed was very stable as compared to the ""biggest"" service provider that I was with for 2yrs previously. The Billing, Payment and other services required was easily settled in the webpage! Definitely had the best experience with MyRepublic! "
5,Good service n helpful staff that always help me on my enquiries.will recommend my family to use my republic line
5,It has been very stable so far!  I have with MyRepublic for 4years. Just hoping that the price won't increase like the other supplier! 
5,"I just re-contract with My Republic for another 2 years! Kudos to their excellent speed and customer service. (vs Singtel, M1 and Starhub) Highly recommend everyone to subscribe to My Republic's service."
2,Everything  seems to be fine only the biling date is on the 24th of each month and due date is on the 1st only 7 days given to pay up the bill if don't pay disconnect if payment decline charge $10 never like give us time to do payment I think this should change and give us time to do payment 
5,"I am a proud customer of MyRepublic Broadband and Mobile! So far, I have not experience any problems with their services. Smooth sailing... Thumbs Up! "
5,I have been a subscriber for 6 years and it has been smooth sailing all the way with smooth connection. The customer service assistants are also friendly and have answered my queries to accessing my bill appropriately.
5,"So far, one of the better ISD provider. Once setup, no trouble at all. Never had to contact the customer service once since i sign up with them more than 3 years ago."
5,"I've use Sing & Tel for all my life but after porting to MyRepublic for almost 2 yrs now, I have not experience any disruptions unlike previous. The connection and speed have been consistent for 3 person usage at home plus I got my mum a myrepublic mobile line! No complains so far and happy! Cheers!"
5,So far so good but sometime quality wifi not clear and hope customer service give better service for customer some case
5,It has been very stable so far! it will still be my first choice in the future! Just hoping that the price wont increase like the other supplier every year!
5,Have not experienced any down times so far. Decent buffering time for 1080p Youtube and Netflix videos. So far so good. 
5,So far so good. We are satisfied with the service connection and help desk services. No major setback encountered and will continue to support MyRepublic. 
5,Excellent ISP. No nonsense. Efficient service. Simple to use. Quick technical help. Seamless upgrading.
5,"Extremely fast and stable internet connection. Very highly recommended for good and stable network.I had been  their customer since the very early days when they are still in the ""Beta Testing"" Stage. Since then i never looked back. The connection is very very stable. "
4,Have been with MyRepublic since I moved to my current place 6 years ago. Happy to have re-contracted a couple of times as its price has been competitive. The service and product has not failed me so far. Long may this continue. 
5,Customer service were very efficient and friendly whenever I need assistance. Always ready to render their helping hand when troubleshooting my questions. Keep up the awesome and amazing work. 
5,"Been with Republic for a while now, and certainly appreciate the service and enjoying it. I have called up the customer service on several occasions for technical help and the assistance was quick and hassle free. Certainly will be recommending to anyone who needs a broadband.  Thank you and keep It up My Republic. "
4,"recontract 5 months back, after completing the first 2 year term.. did seem to be the cheapest at that time as well. Not too many issues, but the speed does fluctuate many times... "
5,"It's been awhile now since I've using MyRepublic. And everything has been smooth sailing. From setting up, to troubleshooting. And now I'm in a place where I don't have to worry anything. Even monthly payment is efficient. Will definitely stays with MyRepublic "
5,"A customer of  one of the mainstream service providers for past years, I finally switched to MyRepublic in May 2018 out of frustration with the former.  So far, my internet connection is no more giving me any problems like before, and, most importantly, I am able to connect with and speak to someone and not a machine when there is a need to settle any issue.  The assurance that your needs matter and are cared for is vital to us consumers. Sadly, this is ignored by other service providers, especially the well established ones.   Well done MyRepublic!  "
5,"Hi, i been using myrepublic boardband for the past 4 years and last year i switch to myrepublic mobile. I been enjoying the services given by myrepublic and i have no issue with it. I have recommend to all my family members and friends. Thank you for your great service. "
5,"Overall the internet is excellent , i hve been using my republic for 3 year and the customer service is courteous . i will recomended to my friend .Good job my republic. "
5,"I've been with MyRepublic for about 3 years. They have excellent customer service. When I shifted to a new house last year, it was a breeze to continue my broadband internet at my new house. I made an appointment with them for the staff to come over and fix the installation at my new house. Staff came punctually and did a good job. My internet service is smooth at all times. Still continuing my contract with them and will continue to do so. I am one happy customer! Thanks MyRepublic."
5,Been using MyRepublic internet for 3 years and on-going. No major disruptions so far and the customer service personnel are also quite responsive to my issues. Renewal of the contract are also breeze free and its all online basis.
5,"We have never had any issues with MyRepublic so far - they have been quite responsive with installing as well and customer service as well, which is what you want when it comes to Internet connection, right? They also let you know when the internet is going to be down for revisions, which is good because this allows you to program yourself - in saying that, they do choose the most convenient times as possible, so it doesn't affect the use of its' clients so much. Thanks! Paula"
2,"After using Myrepublic smart 35 for 5 months , I found the network connection is not smooth and always there are breaks along the way. This is clearly notice when my internet radio gets disconnect now and then compare to My singtel and TPG plan. They do not have this interruption and breaks. Disappointed with the service provider. May be it is Starhub problem. "
4,I switch from M1 to My republic and has re-contract once. No Complaint is the best compliment from the gamer in my house!   So far the connection of the WIFI is better as compare. So far no provider down is one of the plus point. Price is reasonable and customer service also good. 
3,"Overall the internet service has been smooth, but at time it is a bite slow to connect from my PC.  Also the pricing , in my opinion is slightly high compare to the other provider in the market.  Another suggestion is that your installer should spend more time to explain to the user on the function and usage of the new Router at  the  time of installing it."
5,"My connection with MyRepublic started in Feb 2012 when they first launched. I switched from Starhub to MyRepublic and there was no turning back since then. Back then, I was assisted by Lawrence from the sales and Kelvin Seo from technical and both of them provided best services. Subsequently, I introduced and recommended to many of my relatives and friends and most f them have no complaint about the services, speed of the internet connection and the packages offered by Myrepublic.  Keep it up!"
5,"At first, I've got no confidence about this company whereby my friend told me about. After I tried to be their customer, looks like a different from what my Friend say! I'm now a customer from broadband to mobile Services. I'm happy and continue to be their customer! Thank you Myrepublic..."
5,I've joined since 2017 and I just renew my contract for another 2 more years with option to choose gadgets within your price range! It's affordable and fast! Excellent customer service and always settle on time without delayed. GOOD JOB and KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!! 
1,"Been using my republic for more than 3 years at my parent's house.  Recently this year problems came. When the Broadband/phone line unable to use, need to travel down to check for them, Before i call the support, standard troubleshoot on/off equipment, when i called support ask me to do the same way again. I went to the Facebook website, no notice on system down. When problem unsolved, called again, then was told by another staff that is their exterior fault since few hours ago.   Why i was not told when the 1st time i called?  In the end the broadband in active about 2 days. Will consider to discontinue. "
3,"I've been a broadband subscriber for nearly 18 months. During the first 12 months, I experienced fantastic service with barely any disruptions. However in the past 4-6 months, I have been experiencing slow and disrupted service of home broadband which has led to some dissatisfaction. Overall, it's fine for what I pay but would be better if I didn't experience disruptions in service. "
5,A member since 2016 and no regrets at all! There are no disruptions in the service.Internet service has been smooth. I appreciate the email reminder for scheduled maintenance. I have even shifted my phone lines to MyRepublic.  
5,Ive been using my republic for like 1year plus for the broadband and now for 2 mobile plans. Really good service and the internet is always smooth. Just love it will continue supporting them. Cheers to my republic üòçüòç
4,Happy with the change to my republic since 2 years ago. I have now signed  up for my mom's place too.  2 accounts at 2 different locations but paying at affordable $$. The internet speed is amazing! Relatives and friends who hang out at my place commented the same. Some  has also made their switch. ;)
4,"I recontracted my broad band service with Republic several months ago. unfortunately, I did not switch the phone line at the same time. suggest that Republic to work out a program for those who a get subsidy from the company. understand the requirements of those people and let them use the subsidy well. it will help the Republic to get more customers"
3,"It was recommended by my relatives to switch to Republic. However, the experience with Republic isn't that wonderful because the internet speed is not smooth and often slow. I have tried calling in many times to the customer's service hotline but the issue was not resolved and getting someone down requires a fee. "
5,I am glad I switch to myrepublic. Internet is good and price wise I save so much then my previous Internet provider. Glad I change it!  On top of that I get a great handphone when I bought the internet using a promo. Thank you myrepublic!! 
5,"I was recommended by my friend about My Republic and install it since April 2019, overall performance are satisficed and never have break down issue since using. I will probably recommend to all my friend to use their services.  "
5,to me and family the network is great.. we had quality family time watching online movie without any disruptions. my kids gets to enjoy their netflix without any intermittent. working from home using this network is just like being in office. thumbs up 
5,Good services and fast respones from the customers service and will keep on updating us for new promotion thumps up!
3,"The home broadband networks is generally very good although it would be better if we were able to choose our own routers.  However, the company hasn‚Äôt been able to adapt their mobile service package in the face of competition and I‚Äôve began to transfer my lines to the other mobile service providers.  In addition, the free public Wi-Fi service provided at Starbucks is a BIG pain. The company hasn‚Äôt been responsive enough to also adapt based on feedback given and it‚Äôs hurting their brand as well as the client who had engaged them so much so that I‚Äôve stopped going to Starbucks and started going to CBTL just due to the better Wi-Fi services in CBTL."
5,Internet very fast i highly recommend to everyone Last time using starhub/singtel/M1 these 3 brand slow and sometime lagging. I hereby recommend everyone to use Myrepublic Thx. 
5,"I've switched to MyRepublic Broadband service almost 5 years ago, together with the digital landline phone service.  I was really impressed by the technical site team, as they did the setup and testing of the wifi signal strength all around the apartment... even the master bathroom! The tech guys were so helpful when we needed another access point for the server at home, and they did their best to connect and test everything, they were so polite and respectful of our demanding requirements, and  yet ever so friendly with us.   We have the highest praise for the broadband reliability, no major service disruptions that I could recall, the speed is superb! I found the MyRepublic service and tech staff genuinely helpful, which is more than I can say for the other local competing service providers that I shant mention here. The package I signed up for is just true value for money.  Thank You MyRepublic!!  Cheers, to your continued success."
3,Network need to improve especially on Sunday. And also connection range! From third floor can‚Äôt receive!
4,"ometimes boardview (wifi)signal fail ,call tech svc to check or trace ,they found nothing wrong,but my end cant connect or cut off suddenly althought my router is new.signal shown strong i think need to check yr end server maybe."
5,"Was recommended by a cousin many years ago, and now I have a recontract with them at additional $10 off monthly. Very reliable throughout the contract period, any service downtime was duly informed through email way in advance. Plus the downtime was always in the wee hours of the morning, so it does not affect much of daily internet routine. "
4,"Except for some occasional weak wifi signal, service has been satisfactory since my previous 3 contracts signed"
5,The best ever fibre broadband I  ever use. The wifi coverage is superb can even penetrate through thicks walls and even I can receive coverage both of my two washrooms.It is much better than Singtel I‚Äôve used before I signed up with MyRepublic.Will strongly recommend to all new subscribers out there.Really thumbs up for them!
5,"I've been with MyRepublic for more than 3-4 years. I was also there when they first offered their mobile service, and the experiences have never been short of amazing. It's amazing because they don't claim to know everything, but would always try their best, ever politely, ever respectful, yet friendly with their interactions with me. I know friends who have similar experiences too. They don't judge us: whether we're paying for an $8 monthly or a $100++ or above service; they treat all of us with genuine dignity, a behaviour that none of their competitors, ALL of whom are more experienced and have more resources than them, have ever done so (and I've used all of them respectively at some points in time). This should be the norm, rather than the exception. But because this is not, we can only Thank Goodness for MyRepublic."
5,This is one of the cheapest almost all the broad band available in Singapore. There is a contract and no contract scheme so no more tension of penalties for contract breakage as compared to other broad bands. 
5,"In the beginning I was sceptical about MR's fibre bb services, but after several years of using another competitor's home bb services which went from bad to worse, I decided to take up the no-contract fibre bb service on offer in 2016 as i didn't want to be burdened by the 2 years obligation if the service was not what I expected.  I never looked back since then and even signed on 2 years to show my support and faith in MR! I will continue to use their service as they have proved since day one to be reliable and quality-oriented. Well done MR, you're the quality benchmark in the market worth our every penny! "
4,"So far, my broadband service is trouble free. I did have an episode when it was down for a few days due to road construction which damaged the connections. Fortunately it was professionally handled and I was pleased with the recovery efforts."
5,Good service  and reliable network i will recommend to all my friends and relatives  fast action taken when problem occur  well done my republic
5,Have being using MyRepublic Ultra 1 Gbps for more than 6 months and is extremely satisfied with its broadband services. Highly recommended.
5,Great and fantastic broadband service that never fail you.Not a single issue after using it for the past 2 years..will continue to support them..great work and keep it up guys..
5,Have been using their service for 2 years plus now. So far theres no major issue with the service provided.  It has been a smooth and reliable experiance for me and my family.   Will definately recommend to others without any doubt. 
5,We switched over our fiber board and from another regular telco. Another couple of months will mark the end of the 24 months contract with MyRepublic.  We did not face any issues since.  We will continue to support by recontracting our fiber broadband.  
5,Been using them for more than a year now. Stable provider with great speed and good prices! Would recommend MyRepublic to anyone that's currently not satisfied with their current provider.
5,"Has been My Republic broadband user almost 19months. Up till now,we have no issue and will continue to use their broadband even my contracts endsüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
5,Many year been using so far it‚Äôs gd the board band is fast sometimes it‚Äôs slow maybe too many of them using any problem contact operator very gd service tq
5,"I am with MyRepublic ever since it launched the cheapest 1 Gbit fibre broadband plan at $49.99/mth many years ago, that was when other telcoms started to bring down their prices drastically, thanks to MyRepublic and I am greatful for it! Over the years, I have not encountered any service breakdown (not that I couƒ∫d remember). Great service provider!  Lim  "
5,"Never been happier with MyRepublic. Very stable and reliable ISP Internet speed is consistently fast and best is, no throttling!! "
5,Have been with MyRepublic for a couple of years now. I love how everything can be handled online. Customer service has been great too. 
5,I have been using my republic for fee years now since i have switched from starhub.. so far there is no problem i have encountered and even the phone calls made are awesome.. impressive indeed
5,"I have been a loyal MyRepublic subscriber since switching over from Starhub in 2014. Did not have any issues with the line and the Asus routers are great. Have relocated to Punggol West this year relocated the internet line too. Unfortunately, the new house Internet speed was slow (about 300Mbps++). After calling the support, they managed to resolve the issue and speed is back to around (800Mbps++).  Will be a loyal customer for the forseeable future."
5,We have been using Myrepublic for 2years now. The service is good and payment are easy and automatic if you set up your payment. Transfer of ownership was also ease. Earlier they had whatsapp number for queries but now they have moved everything to mail. Good customer experience till now.
5,"I am into my 4th year of using MyRepublic. So far so good and internet connection is good. I hardly had any down times and even if there were, MyRepublic usually resolved them very promptly. Been recommending to my peers. "
5,Republic is relatively stable compared to the previous line I had used before. The price of the broadband is a plus point too. I will recommend republic over the main three lines we had over the years. I had lesser downtime and more stable connection that enable to stream thru my favourite show and my gaming session. Keep up the work.
4,"I've had a great experience overall. Just the 5G some times does not appear in my list of networks..beyond,  that, no issues at all"
5,I signed the no contract broadband a year ago. No issues during this one year and recently i decided to changed to the one with 2 year contract. Calling in took some time but customer service personnel was pretty helpful. Engineer on site was also friendly and knowledgeable. Would consider their mobile plan next :)
5,I've been using MyRepublic broadband for years after switching from StarHub and I am very happy with the quality since then; very rarely when I have issues a quick call to the service centre is all it takes to get back up to speed.  They also reward users with discounts to other services like digital voice and mobile which I also currently use MyRepublic for and I am very happy about.  Highly recommended!
5,"My 4th year with Myrepublic after changing from singtel. I seriously do recommend to upgrade to the ASUS routers cause they are amazing, i have no issues with the service provider for 4 years, never had to call once and the ASUS routers still look like they can last me for another 5 more years. No more sudden disconnects, no more down time. "
4,"Second time re-contract, everythings are ok except the customer service agents are ""sucks"", train to folllow the script and answer your query, difficult to understand their accent! "
5,MyRepublic's customer service is excellent. No issues with wifi connection at home. Online payment mode is hassle free. Monthly subscription is affordable. Overall extremely satisfied with MyRepublic.
5,I usually didn‚Äôt have any issues with the internet connectivity. Only times are when I forgotten it was under maintenance. I also can‚Äôt comment on the phone help service as I would like a personal touch instead. I have just re-contract via the walk-in at causeway point. It was a breeze and was done in less than 10 minutes. Keep up the good work guys!
5,"Overall  the  service is  acceptable, I  give  90 point. I  using  the broadband  from 2014,when just  started  the  signal is  ok, but  the technical  support  not  meet  my expectations, the  price  maybe  can  set more  lower. That  will  it  more  competitive  to  others  broadband  provider. Thanks "
5,"I‚Äôm supposed the Pioneer customer since Myrepublic established. I‚Äôve been using the broadband contracted and recontracted. The access is very stable and so far I‚Äôm very satisfied with the performance. My deepest gratitude to all the people in Myrepublic, your services and friendliness is excellent !"
3,"Your support kinda sucks. Even when it's the router issue you expect your customers to pay for technician to come down. You are not even troubleshooting the wifi issue, just LAN. then why are we subscribing to wifi? We are not purely subscribing 4 lan lines for 4 direct connections right "
5,"The broadband network stability is better than the one I have, till now it did not give me any problem.   However the billing for phone line is quite confusing, showing as a billed item, when it was advertised as free. Why bill something when you advertised as free, this does not make any sense at all."
5,I switched from Singtel to MyRepublic. It has been great (no problems at all)  and best of all it's affordable. Its been almost 3years and I have recommended friends and relatives too. Good job MyRepublic!
5,Switched from M1 to MyRepublic. This telco will never let you down on the internet speed with the different plans for different environment! Will definitely continue using it!
5,Good internet service provider. Been a loyal customer for more than 5.5 years.  There a no instance that I face poor internet connection or any other problem so far.
5,"Compared to other ISPs I have been with before I joined MyRepublic (about 7 years ago), I am very happy and satisfied to share that MyRepublic is definitely the better in terms of good, consistent internet speeds. No more lag spikes after 9pm to interrupt your gaming, very little to no downloading pauses to interrupt your streaming. Maintenance downtimes were pre-empted and set at a very off-peak timing, and have always been completed within stated times. I only had to contact their customer service once over my 7 year period with them, and it was over a billing issue (which was resolved once and for all). "
5,"Myrepublic has focus a lot of attention for their customer service.  When it comes to speed for the price , they are one of the faster internet providers in the nation."
5,"I am user of MyRepublic Broadband since year 2017, switched from major telco to MyRepublic as I wanted to use my own router. MyRepublic ONT is bridge device rather than router. So, I can fully utilise my own router.   So far the network is stable and good in performance. I haven‚Äôt experienced any unexpected network interruption due to their service problem. I used to have issue with throughput between Singapore and Japan early year 2019. But with several maintenances conducted by MyRepublic, it seems the issue has been resolved. Now I do not see any major performance issue with gaming (NINTENDO online), video streaming, audio streaming.   I have not experienced calling their customer service yet. I cannot review quality of their technical or customer support. At least they inform maintenance schedule through email in advance. So, you can prepare for it.   Overall, I am happy with MyRepublic. "
5,"Been using My Republic for a year. Really good customer service, fast email replies and reliable. No service disruption so far. Will continue using them all the way!"
4,"Product and services are great. Improvement can be made on waiting time when customers call in. However, good and reliable information given on the enquiries made."
5,Have switched from M1 to myrepublic since they started in sg. So far no regrets. Great customer's service and friendly.  Most importantly no disruption at all for the broadband. Will continue with them for sure. 
5,I have been using myrepublic for more than 4 years. The service and connections have not failed me. Thank you myrepublic for the excellent service.
4,"I started using My Republic because I did not want an internet provider that gave me a contract, as I was not sure what my long term plans would be. I find that though the internet connection can be slightly wonky at times, it is on the whole clear, provided good reception and is able to maintain good and strong bandwidth most of the time.   I have also tapped on their mobile promotion to add on a line and enjoy unlimited usage (Data/ Calls/ SMS) starting October 2019.   Thanks, My Republic for providing us a non-contractual service that serves us well! :)"
4,"I have been using this Telco for few years. The home network is very stable, almost no issues on using the service but there is still room for improvement for their customer service."
5,"I have been a MyRepublic customer since 2014 after I gave up on Starhub's poor cable modem network service, slow DNS network and the lousiest customer service you could ever get from a telco who is unable to deliver their Brand Promise as well as they do their marketing!   Since I migrated to MyRepublic, the Internet feels like an upgrade! I have been extremely satisfied with MyRepublic's:  - 1Gbps fibre broadband network  - the upload/download speeds are fast  - network uptime is at 99.995%   - my WiFi network at home reaches a throughput of 600 - 700 Mbps on the ASUS RT-A68U router  - my video streaming is always in the 20Mbps - 30Mbps range giving me full HD quality movies  - their network has low latency and nearly no buffering - my WhatsApp, ZOOM and Google Hangout video calls are smooth, clear and always functioning - my download/upload/syncing to Google Drive, Google Photos, Google Mail and BOX works at the fastest speeds possible.   MyRepublic, you deserved all the business success a great telco like you should have, which is why I have referred 50 to 60 friends and family members to switch to your network.   I am most grateful that you launched the no-contract $49/month plan, allowing me to test your network for 6 months before I sign a contract with you. You have exceeded all my expectations and I am happy to say that as long as you uphold and maintain this quality of your network, I will be your customer for life. "
5,I have been using this Internet broadband and the service is really good and the internet speed is very fast and I also subscribe to their mobile plans too. The plans were good too without worries of been tied down by contracts.
4,"Very affordable broadband plans. Will continue to support them. When my mobile contract is up, I am considering to switch mobile plan from the telco company."
5,"I was never a very attentive customer or paying attention very closely to the deals that my republic has to give. I was from Starhub and a passive payer. Do not know what am I paying or benefiting. I was recommended by a friend to join my republic provider. Aside from the problem setup at first, the service that I experience from my republic is excellent. The price that I am paying is worth every dollar. With my republic having an attractive offers it never fail me to get updated to their amazing offers. Now I have no hesitation on recommending Singapore providers. My first name that I will mention would be MyRepublic. Thank you for being my first pick."
4,So far so good. Has been quite stable and little downtimes as compared to other telcos. And the price is relatively competitive as well.
5,"Been a subscriber of other telcos for 13 years but since i signed up 3 years ago, i have never regretted it once. I have 6 people in my house and most nights and weekends we streamed online on each devices with no interruptions. I will definitely recommend others to port over to MyRepublic as your preferred telco for broadband.. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº"
2,Really disappointed on you for both broadband and mobile unlimited plan.. Your  signal for phone is really poor.. Broadband seems to me in low speed eventhough for 1gbps..
5,"I have been using MyRepublic‚Äôs broadband service for at least 6 or 7 years now, maybe more. What I enjoyed most is the reliability of the service it offers. I have never had any issue in all these years. And the only time I bother the customer service is upgrade my plan. 5 stars from me. "
5,Awesome network. I had both home wifi and mobile sim on my republic and all is good. Would be better if we are able to sign up for more than 1 mobile plan for installments.
5,The service is good. Inform you ahead of time for maintenance. Internet speed is stable. Hardware provided works well. 
5,"I renewed my contract with Myrepublic not because they are the cheapest. Which I really hope they would do something about it, especially to loyal subscribers. But because for the 2 years I'm with them, there has been no issues whatsoever and their support and responses have been good. I considered switching to rival companies and compared the support and responses they gave, and that steered me back to Myrepublic. "
5,"As ive used My Republic broadband n sim card,i tink its very very good...i will stay with My Republic n continue to subscribe with whatever promo tat will be coming in future...."
5,Got a recomendation from a family member. Went to an IT show and got impress with the price(very important) and the speed of the data. No hassel. Never had any problems from start till now. Its been a year now..
4,"It simple and easy no complications , friendly staff.have been using it for a few months with trouble free.it will better if can have an upgrade with a lower price for a loyal customer rewards,a better option on Mobile plan to choose."
4,I have been using MyRepublic broadband for several years now. There has not been any major issues and I am generally satisfied with the service so far. I will continue to support MyRepublic (just recently re-contracted with them).
1,"Moved to a new location, mistakenly registered a new address rather then port over. Now servicing my own place and still paying for the service my old place because myrepublic refuses to assist me with an early termination without penalty. That is how they reward your loyalty to them."
5,IVE BEEN 2YEARS WITH MY REPUBLIC BROADBAND TO BE FRANK THEIR QUALITY AND PAYMENT METHOD  AND ABOUT PRICING AFFORDABLE AND FLEXIBLE IVE TRY OTHER COMPANY BROADBAND STILL I CHOOSE MY REPUBLIC üòç 
5,The line was good been using it nearly a year and it's worth the value. The customers service is very knowledgeable 
5,I have been a customer for 3 years. Never had a problem (touch wood). Will continue with MyRepublic. Didn't like that my previous provider who is trying to play catch up now. 
3,the customer service has improved. I have changed my plan but it takes  some time  for them to change.  Pretty disappointed...
5,"Services, from installation to customer service, all done efficiently and professionally by the staffs of MyRepublicSg. Never really had major problems with my broadband.  Customer service via chat is efficient and easy to use. The staff really gave clear advice/recommendations for me as end user. Thank you MyRepublic!"
5,I'm very satisfied with their customer service when I need help.They  do their best to rendered their service. The speed if the broadband is better now.It's valued money.Thumb up My Republic 
5,"My Republic are getting better and better. The Speed is good and price are affordable. mobile network coverage is also good. i will surely reccomend my friends, family and colleagues. Thanks my Republic "
5,Internet speed is good. Afforable and worth to be one of the users. Im be MyRepublic Braoadband users nearly 9yrs. Good customer service and recovery process whenever needs require.
5,"Generally, as a normal home userÔºåthe service is good in terms of speed and customer service. The notifications for service maintenance sent the the users days before down time, and the scheduled downtime did not impact me so far. The only downside is the price is not that comparative. "
4,Internet speed is good. But coverage limit is not so high and also at times we are facing connectivity issues which affects the trustworthiness of the brand.
4,Myrepublic is not bad for gamers as my brother is a hardcore gamer. Wifi connection not bad as well. But at times wifi signal not as stable whereas by cable its strong. 
5,With MR for more around 3yrs so far network still ok. Happy with the network                           
5,I was introduced to MR by my colleague and so far I am very satisfied with the network.  I will continue to support MR.
5,One of the best decisions made when I took up the broadband package. Customer service have not failed me whenever it comes to troubleshooting and have been vert helpful thruout my 2 years .More years to come and Keep up the excellent service.
5,Setting up was no hassle and installation was fast. Been using the same service for 6 years. No complaints except for some down time during maintenance which was notified much earlier via email so we‚Äôd expect it.
5,"Recently renewed my broadband contract for another 2 years. Network is generally quite good and stable, allowing us to connect steadily for our favourite shows. MR also offers good deal from time-to-time with router inclusive. Recommended to anyone who‚Äôs still shopping around. I‚Äôd tried the red & green telco in the past, but MR is still worth the money."
4,"Just switched to MR few months back after my family member recommended. I'm glad I did. Network is good even when I'm in my room with door closed and it didn't caused any trouble when I'm watching my favourite series, unlike using the previous one."
4,Been using My Republic Broadband for a year plus and so far connection so good. Maintenance always done it during our sleep time. So no issue on this. 
3,Had been with MR for quite a few years and recently the speed is slow and connection was intermittent and laggy. Maybe MR should look into the issues and rectify it before loyal customers divert to other service providers. 
4,"Few things I like about MyRepublic is because my initial application and subsequent renewal could be done online instead of through phone calls or retail shop, maximum a phone call to confirm the delivery of hardware/installation services.   ISP aren‚Äôt always perfect, but during the instance they were down they provided quick backend assistance and got our connection back up within an hour.   Announcements will always be made during maintenance where internet will be unavailable and they would choose the timing where there were least usage.  Lastly pricing are always kept competitive among other ISP‚Äôs."
5,"Been using MyRepublic Broadband for half a year. so far so good. Reliable and stable connection, great for gaming. Maintenance timing is usally off peak after 12 midnight. No major disruption so far."
4,generally good experience. been with MR since 2 years ago and have only had 1 issue which is during recontract time. which resulted in my homeline disconnected for 1 day.
5,"been using MyRepublic since it first started in Singapore. have no problem with it at all, not like SingTel always giving me problems. Thank you MyRepublic for serving my family and me for so many years."
5,We been a big fans for MyPepublic and we LOVING IT We had recommended strongly to most of our family and friends and THEY LOVING IT 
4,"For the past years my broadband have no issue, it was good... but recently almost every night, the connection is lagging or lost connection..."
5,"Valau for money, worth it to apply for basic wifi need at home, would highly recommend it to others and very understanding customer service."
5,"Very easy to purchase, good referral programme, good value for money with quick and very consistent speeds. I have very rarely needed to use customer services but I did use them once to help with a proxy server and they were very helpful. "
2,The connection speed is intermittently slow despite repeated calls to customer service and their assistance. Am thinking of switching provider if speed doesn't improve soon! 
3,Customer service is fine. But my broadband connection is slow and down sometimes at night. Reported it buy nothing helps. Can someone look into it. 
5,"Been using for the past 5,6 years for 2 household... No major issues encountered. Recently, the customer service is hard to get hold of.. Nevertheless, you can find troubleshooting online! üòâ"
4,"My internet speed is rather good and it's consistent, just that sometimes the internet will be cut off and I've to wait for a while for it to load again "
3,"myrepublic is not bad but recently seems abit laggy and connection shown excellent but as users using, halfway thru the connection get cuts off . "
4,My republic is good at the first place but after I renew the contract the Internet service is quite slow rather than that the mobile lines no matter how much I use its still the same bill.  Hats off to that. I hope that My Republic will improve more faster on the Internet service. Thank you. Keep up the good work.
5,"After I've been with Myrepublic for 3 years I honestly feel their price is a little stiff, but nevertheless their services, the speed, the billings, and the last but not least is their technicians whom is very impeccably  astute and the knowledgable  staff's in various department. üëçü§ü  The best."
5,So far as customer of my republic i dont have any problem regarding my internet ..and i will suggest friend n relative to get them now üëç thums up myrepublic
5,It's been smooth this last 2 years of using MyRepublic fibrebroad band services. Recontract with them as it was fuss free and no problem so far with the internet services. Hope MyRepublic would keep up the good work with maintaining quality services provided. üí™üòäüëç
1,"Very bad service by My Republic. After recontracting for another 2 more years,  have been consisting facing problems with the broadband, very weak connection. Keep calling them and they ask me to upgrade firmware and say it will work fine and it didn't. Called again and the same thing. The now they say it's my router problem need to call ASUS. I can break my contract also as i still have about 1 more year remaining. Can't wait to finish the contract and change over to others. Do avoid them at all cost. Not worth it. "
5,"It‚Äôs been good experience with My Republic, no down time or anything that bothered us. They have good monthly fee compared to others."
4,Good experience from my recent renewal of broadband contract. Was also given an upgraded set box that now provide much better internet coverage in the house. Tku
4,"We used to have 2 networks at home and my republic is way faster and cheaper than the singtel wifi that my other housemates are using. Although there are times it gets lag during around past midnight, it still work much better. "
5,"My Broadband 1GB plan with MyRepublic .  Just done speed test with Ookla apps with MyRepublic Server in the late morning 28 Sep 2019. Router used is Asus RT-AC88U (3.5 years old).  1.  HP Envy 15 j126TX  (5 years old) PING:  3 ms,  DOWNLOAD:  546.23 Mbps,  UPLOAD:  467.60 Mbps  2.   Samsung S9 (2 years old) PING:  4 ms,  DOWNLOAD:  512 Mbps,  UPLOAD:  393 Mbps At late evening hours, S9 speed test matches my Notebook speed.  So happy with the WIFI connection speed.  On the whole experience 5.5 years with MyRepublic rather outstanding in terms of speed and zero Hiccups.  Before settling down with MyRepublic was SingTel and StarHub. Consistency in broadband speed with MyRepublic is a great.  Hope it helps other in deciding value for money with MyRepublic broadband."
5,We seldom have network outages with the myrepublic broadband service. It is generally fast and reliable.
5,MyRepublic is all about speed. It is making the world addicted to speed. and It will be a mistake to think without speed
3,"Sad, I have no idea why am I still paying extra $10 when new sign up is getting cheaper rate... poor me have to endure another year of more expensive contract"
3,"We are living in a ""Smart Nation"" with technology gadgets that require a decent network speed. I regret to say that my experience with My Republic was disappointing. Despite changing the modem/router for me, the lag and slow internet speed is still happening.  As it has been happening since June 2019, the tech support mentioned that it could be a firmware issue or other technical matters.   I followed their advice for a change of router + a re-contract, but sadly this issue isn't resolved.   I wished a compensation was given for the slow network I've received since June, but it was a challenge asking the support staff for it.   3 stars for sure, as I might not use it again anymore if the lag is persisting until 2020."
5,"Have been enjoying the wifi system at my home since its installation about a year ago.  No problem  encountered so far.  Speed is suitable for my present need.  Keep up the good work, My Republic!"
5,"The overall experience is great. Been using Myrepublic for 3 years plus. So far didn't have any connection issue. Provide great ping when I play competitive shooter games, would recommend especially if you like to game. "
4,Occassionally connection lags with issues. Adding on to that Customer Service never easy to reach. I've been with my republic for 3 years now. Recontract promotion should have better options.
4,overall experience is good. except for a few incidents the network speed suddenly becomes very slow and unaccessible 
5,Good network with minimal lag and maintenance during my usage. With them for like almost 4 years. Using after market Router can get me like 450-480Mbps on iPad Pro and on Lan about 8-900mbps. I‚Äôm subscribing to the 1Gb plan. 
5,Never encountered any connection problem or interuption in 5+ years using its service. Service is good too. 
4,"Sign up with Myrepublic after being sick of the orange label of trying to find new customers rather than retaining existing one. Other service providers are having not so stable connection too. To date, my only complaint for myrepublic is their way of private IP addressing while getting a standard IP requires additional charges (which is a default for other ISP). This causes some IOT connectivity issues at the earlier part of my subscription with Myrepublic. "
5,"Going over 3 yrs nows with internet service with Myrepublic. Got a mobile plan for my mum too since the plans were cheap and suitable for her. Also added in a mobile phone for her with the monthly installments, which is easier on the wallet! Looking forward to more great deals üòçüëç"
5,I Switch from Starhub to Myrepublic  when it started. Till today I‚Äôm still with Myrepublic. Myrepublic did not disappoint me at all.  But the offer and recontract offer can be better. Please review the promotion offer. 
5,Every since I switch to my republic the internet has been stable and fast..... no regrets. Well done!!! 
5,"Never let me down. Has been using MyRepublic for a year, service staffs are efficient & response promptly via email. Product has never given me any problem at all, no lagging & network is fast. Polite reminder when payment is due via Email. I am contented. I will recommend anyone to try to subscribe to MyRepublic. Prices are extremely reasonable depending on your usage they have several package to suit your needs. Thank You MyRepublic.  From Republic subscriber: Veronica Goh."
5,Its was a excellent service since the day i started to port over my internet to myrepublic. The customer service over the phone was also friendly and helpful with the difficulty i m facing before. Myrepublic is the best and i would recommend others is they require for home service. Thank u Myrepublic. Supporting u till now..
5,"Honestly I‚Äôm very satisfied with your service since my 1st contact to Install my WiFi In 2016 And recently when I went to  MyRepublic Service Counter at Bedok Mall to ReNew my 2-yr contract...  Honestly Efficient Service, Smooth WiFi experienced & Very friendly Staff... Keep it up with your excellent service üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº"
5,Switching to MyRepublic was a good choice. Connection is steady and customer service is helpful. Online services are easily accessible too. 
3,"The broadband service offered by MyRepublic is quite mediocre when compared to the service offered by Singtel & StarHub. The browsing speed is horrendous usually at nights. I would be trying to stream Football or Netflix, the streaming is quite slow when compared to the services offered by Singtel. They have quite a lot to improve! "
5,Was recommended by my sister to use my republic broadband as other telco broadband been giving us lot of problem. So far yet to encounter any issue with my republic. Customer service side has always been helpful and solve my problem if I'm having some issue or enquiry. Thank you
5,Been using MyRepublic for 2 years now and so far I dont have much issue. The recontract was prompt and they have good offer that comes along with the contract.
5,Been using My Republic for more than a year now and so far it hasn't given us any issue thus can't comment much about customer service cos ain't got a chance to use it yet. 
5,Have renewing my contract with them ever since switching from the big 3. Never have any issue and customer service is supportive!
5,I have been with this company for over 4 years now and have never had a problem. MyRepublic from Best Telecom made the transition so easy & simple. MyRepublic has A+++++ Customer Service Skills. Best Telecom are a 100% Singaporean Provider that doesn‚Äôt involve an overseas call centre. I highly recommend Best Telecom for all your Communication services. They took care of everything and made sure even installing my modem and connecting my house phone into the modem was so well explained and i was walked through every step of the way.‚Ä®My plan also dropped and i am now saving more money aswell.‚Ä®Even when i enquiry about a charge on my bill they got back to me within a few days and fixed the problem.
1,"Lately they're The worst customer service ever. Its ever so difficult to get in touch. Email ,call,chat all useless platforms cause zero response."
3,Onsite technical officer is very knowledgable. Managed to resolved my internet speed issue. Customer service officer is the exact opposite. Tell me 50mbps is a normal for my 1gbps network. 
5,"Ever since i switched to Myrepublic from Singtel, I have never turned back. Hassle free and no gimmicks, just consistent service. Only little little complain i have is at times speeds are not desirable but overall good! Thank you and please continue to do well/ "
5,"I have been a loyal MR customer since MR started as a Broadband Service Provider. Never regretted switching. As for the MVNO, I was disappointed as at 1 point I felt that the $80 plan was a great deal but it wasn‚Äôt - there was a period of distrust but everyone makes mistake. Move on, improve. MR (mobile) did! In fact, I‚Äôm now considering getting a mobile plan again with MR (mobile) after its initial blunder. Don‚Äôt give up MR be in the game for us and you!"
5,"I have been using MyRepublic broadband for 3 years +. Great service provider. No issues with connection, billing. Great prices compared to competitors. Overall superb and definitely recommend people who are not using MyRepublic to switch to them!"
5,"I have been a very happy customer of My Republic since 2015....initially using them as my internet service provider and since last year, my mobile phone provider.  I have rarely experienced any downtime with their service and customer support is fantastic! Strongly endorsed and recommended by me!  "
5,"I have been using my republic for about 1 year and i honestly love their customer service very efficient,helpful and patient,the broadband is very stable itself and never fail me..will recommend to my friend and neighbour. Well done my republic."
4,"Great broadband, good service provider. Easy monthly payment of services.  So far we have no problems with the service and will recommend to our circle of friends and family."
5,"I've been with my republic for over 4 years. I've moved house twice and each time they were amazing with moving my package from one home to another.  On the second occasion, I'd managed to forget my modem at my last house during the move but the guy was really helpful and helped to get me a new one and get all set up. I like the fact that as an expat, I'm not bound to a contract with MyRepublic, it's a one month rolling contract. It's been a fantastic 4 years"
5,I had 2 broadband at homeüè†. But my republic is the standout and better reception than another one. Will continue my contract with them for sure. And their customers service is also friendly. I'm.sure to continue my service with them. My no 1 choice.
4,"So far I had been using their broadband for close to 6 months. I am quite satisfied in their services. In term of pricing wise, it‚Äôs affordable. "
3,laggy at times. slow connection sometimes too. hopefully it will get better in time. app can be better
2,"Been a broadband user of them since 2011. The starting years were still rosy and smooth, especially the cx svc. Mid thru out the 2015-2017, offers and cx svcs weren't as good, probably they were stretched cos trying out for the mobile operator tender thingy, I think? These couple years a little got back up, hopefully they can maintain the stretch (and still offer desirable promo offer for existing customers to re contract with them) , or even be at the level of when they 1st started out - the small dog with the big fight (against the green, orange and red). "
4,Have chosen the deco M5 and as a mesh product compared against the traditional wifi connection.  It have tremendously improved in a lot be it connectivity or wirelessly. Hoping to see further more mesh products from my republic in the near future. 
5,"I‚Äôm happy with the service and support of MyRepublic and probably one of the first batch of customers to sign on.  I only hope that when my time to renew the contract comes, they still have the offers which they gave at COMEX."
3,"I switched to My Republic from SingTel 2 years ago because I was sick of SingTel‚Äôs high-handed ways. I actually paid more for My Republic but I wanted to support David‚Äôs fight against Goliath. My kids felt that My Republic‚Äôs wifi is not as stable as SingTel‚Äôs and I reminded them to give the new player a chance. I‚Äôve recently ended my 2-year contract with My Republic and renewed for another 2 years. I‚Äôm given a lower rate which is now better than SingTel‚Äôs rate. They are also changing my router. So, financially it‚Äôs starting to make sense to switch, let‚Äôs see service-wise whether it improves too. I‚Äôll still support the newcomer‚Äôs fight against the big old giant anyway üëå"
5,Been using my republic fiber optic internet connection for about 3 years. I paid additional $$ for a better modem. I‚Äôm glad that I made that choice. I didn‚Äôt need to restart the modem from time to time compared to the modem of other service provider. Connection and speed has been stable. 
4,"been with myrepublic for many years,overall was satisfied with their service and internet connection,will definitely recommend to others."
1,Unstable network and extremely poor customer service  Takes so long to contact customer service . Price not competitive 
3,I have been with MYrepublic for 4years and most of the time the connection is good except for occasional lagging. 
4,"Been with MyRepublic for many years. There were no major issues so far and  the service has been smooth. Enquires through call centre were all right and promptly answered. On my recent recontracting through call centre, I was impressed that the staff noted I was overcharged and was made good instead of covering it up. But the provider should inform customers when their contract is due soon instead of customers monitoring themselves. And inform them of various promotions available. This would improve customer satisfaction. "
4,I am with my republic for more than 4 yrs now. Overall am satisfied with the service. Some of your promotional staff need more training in explaining your promo adequately. Your overseas phone connections need more emphasis.Thx
5,  it was very affortable price.  to every one.. and the loading momentem is very fast .  for wifi  no problem in signal. etc ... that the good part of it 
5,"I have been using My Republic for almost 5 yrs now... Its vry powerful & the speed is great... I have never had any power shut down or lagging with this provider Even the customer service hotline are vry helpful too for enqueries or mode of payment Ive 2 mobile lines with them too and had been using it for almst 1 year now... Payment for bills are also flexible and easy No hassle during installing period too A year ago,ive recommended my cousin to My Republic too He also finds it useful and hassle free irregardless of installing and payment method The best is,we can ensure its not lagging or having power failure... Thank you My Republic... Keep up the great work in providing a great service in Fiber...üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëçüëçüëçüëç"
5,Awesome and user-friendly broadband No issue since the day started .Hope keep it that way.Always recommend to others regards of the awesome coverage.  
5,I have been subscribing my republic for like nearly 4years. Speedy network connection and prompt service are the reasons why I still choose ‚Äòmy republic‚Äô . And it‚Äôs easy to apply too! I still recommend it for my friends who want to apply the broadband.
4,Been with MR 2yrs+ so far so good. Internet speed is fast. Would have given 5 stars if not for a couple of outages
5,"Dissatisfied with my previous telco's broadband speed and throttling, I decided to use MyRepublic's basic 1GB plan.  I'm very satisfied with the speed and performance.  I would recommend to friends and colleagues."
5,"I have been with My Replublic for 4 years , I am happy with their broadband fibre so far , nevertheless,I have always pay my bills in advance . Their service quality was good instead of quantity. Thumbs up . Few more months and it‚Äôs time for me to renew my 3rd contract with them . You guys goes a Long way ."
2,"The Only Problem That I Have Now Is I Cant Renew My Contrat Eventhough After I Paid My Oustanding Bills, Its Been 2mth now And This Is Not Good!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Phone call in for any enquiries seems like a great challenge. Much time was spent waiting. As call in is the only revenue to sort out any problems or checking any problems , it becomes a rather frustrating experience. Suggestion to get more operators or staff to mend the phone lines to ease congestion‚Äôs.  Prices was very attractive and competitive until the other telcos lower their prices as well. Any possibilities of making your pricing even more irresistible? "
4,In the begininng i have some connection problem where my wifi is unable to detect or suddenly having weak signals. Solved it by having to restart the routers.. But its better now.  Been having it connected since May 2019 and happy about it  
5,I don't have any problem with the internet connection since we moved to a resale flat (1 year 6 months now). Value for money and good customer service. 
5,So far service with republic is very good. But hope that there will be more promo like discount & privilege to something which I can enjoy. 
1,The internet is not as fast as it states. Countless times I‚Äôve encountered problems to the point i gave up calling as its the same old problems. I can‚Äôt watch a proper show in peace  without the screen being stuck every 5mins & its an embarrassment to me especially when i have guests constantly. It has never been resolved. I cant wait for my contract to end! 
4,"I have been with MyRepublic since the beginning when fibre broadband service was introduce to Singapore. And since then the service that they have provided be it the connectivity speed or the backend technical and customer service support have been outstanding. They delivered what was promised, a fast and steady  internet connection with hardly any downtime or disruption ever recorded. Least to say, it is impressive for an independent telco company to achieve what they have done for their customers. Consistence, high quality and keeping to their promise. Thank you for helping to bridge the world to our home."
5,"So far for my broadband, I have been using myrepublic for more then 4 to 6yrs..and is been quite a worthwhile experience..the internet connection has been generally good and the customer service officer has been great to help to solve any problems I've faced so far. I'm happy to choose myrepublic and will continue to use it as long as possible. I will recommend others too."
5,"MyRepublic is a no-nonsense ISP. It delivers what it promises - fast internet service without any cumbersome add-ons or complicated bills. Everything is very simple with them, and you get what you need at a good, reasonable and affordable price. Can't be happier with what MyRepublic has been providing me for the past 5 years. Oh, and their customer service are also knowledgeable and helpful. Always been a joy speaking with them whenever I have queries or encounter any issues, which was extremely rare. Thank you MyRepublic!"
5,Best internet i ever had.  Been using it for 5years.  Thanks. Keep it up. I have been introduceing it to most of my friends.  The answers from them was great.  
5,I have been with MyRepublic for 3 years now and i found their service are excellent. The broadbands speed are fast and i never once encountered lagging. All in all i am satisfied with MyRepublic broadband. Keep up the good work.
5,good service and technical team answers the phone within 3mins. unlike some other telcos u have to wait 15mins.at least to reach the customer service.
5,"I been used the myrepublic broadband and line few years back,   As I can say, so far it is very  very good, and the service  too.  All about Myrepublic is good.  "
5,"I have been using My Republic broadband Internet for almost up to eight months now and I am very happy with th Internet services. The only thing sometimes I notice is that when the bill in arriving through email and gping t·ªü end of the month always. The Internet seems to be a bit Lag and and disconnection out of the blue when playing online games, which is rather weird when usually I don't even feel lag even using an old phone model and seldom have disconnections on the Internet WiFi.  Hope this would be be fixed. Overall service is excellent. Keep up the great services.üëçüòä"
5,This is the 3rd year I‚Äôm using my republic.. At first I just wanted to try it first but it went well till I also don‚Äôt realize that 2 years had ended and I did a re contract..because I‚Äôm extremely happy with the services.. Compared to Singtel that always laggy even if I‚Äôve already sign up the most expensive one.. But with my republic I don‚Äôt need to sign up the most expensive plan to solve all my problems. No more laggy no more signing up 2 plans for same house to cover the whole house with WiFi. 
5,Should have changed years ago. Good speed and no throttling unlike other networks. Installation is straight forward and hassle free. Will recommend to friends and family. 
5,"The wife line was so strong n good. I love its n no down line, whatever its work.. Everything was good nkthing complain from my family or friends tbey come n use n all ok. We love its n very easy. "
5,"My Republic services are really straightforward. You get what you pay for, plus more! Help is just a chat away, fast and helpful customer service officers. Their app is really easy to understand and use. I‚Äôve been using My Republic for 3 years and I don‚Äôt see myself discontinuing it in future! "
4,Customer service was courteous but not much help sometimes especially with re-contract issue and it may be that the internal policies are rigid.   Been with them for the past 2 years 3 months and internet is reliable(thank God) and usually outages period are short.   Generally I'll recommend this company service to others but it needs to be more customer focused and to empower the frontline group with more authority to make decision so as to win customers loyalty.
1,Had called in about 4 times and yet nobody even bother to pick up calls n serve.. And I spend around nearly 45mins and waste all my time.. I feel very dissapointed.. 
2,Internet connection is intermittent.  Service is also horrible. Whenever we call them with any issues they just ask to reset router or call for a site visit which costs $40 or smth...  
5,Have been using the provider for almost 5 years. Customer service is much more better than others. So far no major hiccups on the internet. Should put handphone plan with line and accept debit cards also. Hope in future will be more interesting updates & offers on the broadband & handphone planüëçüèª
4,The customer service was friendly and great when they came down to my house to fix the router. The internet connection is good and can be connected even when I am outside my house.
5,"Can‚Äôt say much... but MyRepublic is the bestüí™ Highly recommended.. 2 years with MyRepublic... no problem.. wifi speed is goodüíØ Customer service well done üëç not Rude, very calm & kind ... any questions they answer.. never Leave with doubts before.. well done my MyRepublic ... do give us more Mobile plans & new phones .. "
5,It was so stable and peaceful that we didn't had to bother getting in touch with them for any issue. Thanks! 
3,"The experience with M.R is somewhere in between. Loved the prompt service for technical assistance, patience and resolving to matters arise.   Recontract once but didn't give much of a choice to retain our interest by giving/providing vouchers to latest mesh routers as the current one is a distance away from room. Still, it is much a preffered internet provider to have but a lil more tweaking of service or customers relation satisfaction would be a cut above the rest. "
3,"I have been with My Republic ever since they enter the market.  When they 1st launch their pricing is definitely 1 of the best.  But now competitors are catching up.  So maybe is time for them to think of something. Customer service I'm quite satisfied. But like some of the reviews mentioned,  the connectivity at times is very lag.  Especially during the night time.  If this can be solve I think I will definitely give a 5 star."
1,"Been using myrepublic since its launch. However, the speed of the internet dropped drastically months after subscription. Customer service hotline always busy and engaged, difficult to make enquiries"
5,Been using MyRepublic since we have our home 7 years ago. The speed is great and not forgetting their customer service which is top-notch for me compare to other service providers which take mins to get through them.  They are very friendly and always try to solve the problem for me whenever i need help.   Definitely going to switch over my mobile plan to MyRepublic too since I can have the extra value from it as well.
5,"By far, no problems faced. It works perfectly fine like ive used with any other brands. Payment works good. Service provided no issue. Not bad though. "
5,"Be using for awhile so far everything so good. Speed ok ,support ok ,price ok. Try calling the support tech once and they really tried to help solve it for me."
4,"Since i decided to try out MyRepublic years back, i had renewed my contract twice. I had done my comparison with other providers and even though their home broadband prices are relatively similar to the rest, the main reason i still with them is because of the stability of their network. Throughout these years, i did not experience any major downside and my experience with them was mostly pleasant. As a new player, i am quite impressed with their network. But the only improvement they should look into is the waiting time for their call centre. I hope and believe they be able to improve and make our experience even more pleasant! Thank you MyRepublic!"
1,"Seriously bad. Slow or no connection at times. Keep losing connection from my mobile and Internet TV, especially in the evening time. It can be quite pissed off especially when you are watching the show or working half way through! "
5,"1 word Awsome. Easy to connect. Everything is good accept the long wait to be connected to any call centre agent. Beside that I am glad that I have choose Myrepublic.  Have any problems, the helpdest very helpful! Thank you My Republic."
3,"I have been a faithful customer for close up to 4 years now. As this is a request for an honest review, I will share mine. I‚Äôm happy that it started with a free router upon registration and with a good connection. Unfortunately, it became from bad to worse for the connection of internet. Wifi connection deteriorates. My family would complained on how their connection was so weak. There‚Äôs time when the signal was totally gone. I still had poor connection most of the time now. So please do something about it before you start to lose more customers. If there is no improvement on this , I might consider changing my service provider. Thank you!"
5,"Before jumping on board MyRepublic, I was using a different telco service for years. Was recommended to MyRepublic by a relative and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the change. From the get-go, be it from retail service, to speed of internet, from online app and customer service, it has always been a breeze. I love the efficiency and the promptness of MyRepublic. Definitely seeing myself sticking to MyRepublic for years to come. üíú "
5,"Hi, im currently using an Imesh broadband for 2 years. It is the best and fast broadband from other company. So far i've no lagging in downloading or playing games. My republic is the best choice broadband. I will never switch to other company or telco. Thank you My Republic. Will recommend to my friends and families to apply. "
5,"1 word Awsome.  Easy to connect.  Have any problems, the helpdest very helpful! Thank you My Republic."
5,"This is my 1st time being a customer to My Republic in broadband plan.  So far i only signed up for simcard.  To me, my republic has been very efficient and a fierce competitor to other telcos.  I admit i have heard loads of positive and negative feedbacks from friends and families.  After from my personal experience, My Republic is definitely a reliable asset to my home, my daily needs for awesome internet connection (wifi), my daily usage of phone and also to my kids.  Connection for both simcard n wifi are always UP.  Even when there is a malfunction, My Republic customer service assist me all the way n explained to every question asked.  I am proud to be a My Republic customer.  I would gladly refer or recommend to anyone to sign up for My Republic anytime... Keep up the great work... "
5,So far its been smooth sailing and the network is better..and we love the mobile phones deals that we gotten one!
5,Already 3.5 years with MyRepublic fiber broadband 1Gbps plan and there is really no problem. Everything is good.
5,Awesome value for money plan to choose from. Customer service was excellent in solving problems that u faced.  I'm glad move to Myrepublic from my perivous telco for more than 10 years that didn't appreciate their customer.
5,Guess I'm among the first badge?  Everything is good accept the long wait to be connected to any call centre agent. Beside that I am glad that I have choose Myrepublic. 
5,"Solid internet connection, but the best thing for me is their top-notch customer service. Really so much better than the competition."
5,so far this my 3rd renewal contracts..fanstatic no breakdowns no laggins alway on the run. what else can one asked for?
2,"network traffic after midnight suddenly cut off, need to power off and on to get connection back again many time. another setback is there is a connection charge for a new boardband subscription. i get from whizcoms instead for my second boardband subscription. As for the mobile plan i drop, cs not knowledgeable to solved slow network problem, wasted alot of time , round and round, doing non-logical problem solving for few week. At the end i surrender and port in to m1 and problem solved."
4,"Since moving into my new place, upon recommendation by my brother who is also using Republic, I started my new contract with MyRepublic. I like the fact that your company provides a free landline and my last re-contract, you also offered a lower reduced rate and a faster broadband. My grouse is perhaps calling the hotline for assistance and during the first installation, your technician messed up the wiring. Apart from that, happy I swop providers"
5,"i have bundle package from u.very satisfy with service,but unhappy to see that broadband plan is much cheaper than what i sign.will be very happy if u give a better deal "
5,I've been a subscriber since the beginning. Chose them for the one-time fixed IP offering and also the fact that they do not throttle your bandwidth. Can't go wrong with MyRepublic.
4,Renewed my subscription with them as they provide relatively stable fibre broadband service all this while.
5,"I have been a MyRepublic broadband customer since it launched its ""game-changing"" 1-GB broadband service for $49.95 per month.  I also subscribed for fixed IP for a one-time fee of $50 - a must for me. This is not offered by other ISPs.  I also have 3 post-paid mobile subscriptions from MyRepublic at an unbeatable low monthly price.  "
1,Very disappointing. You only care about getting new customers and treat existing customers like trash. Experience 1- I received a email last year informing me that I will be charged higher price every month since I‚Äôm existing customers while there is cheaper price for new customers. Experience 2 - I received a offer to get a unlimited data mobile phone line after 1 year of your advertisement about this unlimited data for new customers. I‚Äôm terminating my republic. Highly NOT recommended 
5,Best ISP that I have contracted with. No throttling and easy to managed billing. Speed always maintained at high end. 
4,Phone help-desk is excellent. Installation is seamless. Improvement can be made by employing a team of specialist who is IT-savvy. Highly recommended. 
5,So far nvr disappoint. I have been a customer for almost 3-4 yrs and i only call for service once tat is due to the router problem.. the internet have nvr failed me.. gaming and streaming without any problems.. thank you
5,"I have been a MyRepublic customer for almost 4 years now. Having switched over from a major green telco (I won't say which), I was pretty skeptical at first. But I realized that I had nothing was fear. Because what was on the other side of that fear was a reliable, fast, efficient, affordable and user-friendly broadband experience.  Today, I have my own place and subscribed to MyRepublic without even thinking twice. Broadband speed is great, downtimes are during the wee hours of the night (kudos to the engineers working so late into the night), and the recontract offers are just amazing.   If I have but one gripe it is their mobile plans. Sad to say, even though their offering is better in terms of benefits (unlimited data, calls), their price point cannot match up to other MNVOs out there. But keep up the good work! I strongly believe one day you'll be able to match up to the big boys out there and grab a huge share of the pie."
4,It‚Äôs been great so far after switching from another supplier. More stable and less lagging and at least the bills are straightforward and accurate. Loving it and will probably stick around for a long while more. :)
5,Started with Singtel broadband fibre because my son wanted to game seriously.  But it was constant lag and disconnection which frustrated my son to no end.  Finally have to terminate and go to MyRepublic and so far so good.  My son is happy so am I.  Double thumbs up
2,Very poor wifi especially at night time. My TV setup got hanged most of the time. Might consider to terminate the contract once it is due.
5,Ive never regretted choosing MyRepublic and their customer service is top notch and never once have i faced any issue with the connections. Highly recommend for sure!
1,Very bad service. Even my mobile line cut off and not even 1month dead line. I been long time customer and this how I have been treated. Lousy service. I waiting my contract end. I will terminate my broadband. The other telco much better service then myrepublic. Very bad service. That my true honest review. 
5,"Currently i am on my 4th contract with my republic...that means once this contract is over i have been with them for 8years..i have no complain regarding their broadband services and also have refer 3 person to sign up which is a work colleague, my brother in law and also my parents and they also have renewed their contract ever since...keep up the good work MyRepublic..."
5,Wow I‚Äôm shook!!! No issues and great customer service - thanks so much guys keep up the SICK WORK BRO
4,So far so good even it lags sometimes. Its my firat time having a fibre broadband and I am happy with Myrepublic wifi service.
3,"When my first contract expired you jacked the price hugely and it was months before I went to a road show and bitterly signed up with a new program.   The third time the service was much better.  I think I called or emailed on the renewal notice.   The sales person was great, gave me a better package and helped me get on mesh wifi.    I hope the last service is signs of things to come."
4,"At times it lag quite a bit but overall experience is OK, a bit more expensive than other telco but I still stick with them for 3rd year coming. "
2,"The hotline is nearly impossible to get in (wait time of over 30 minutes, whereby I usually give up), and the internet is down perhaps once or twice a month.   When called, the technical support simply asks ""have you done a power cycle"", even after a lengthy, detailed explanation of all the steps tried previously. Other than the support, the service is actually good (when it is usable and not down), hence the extra star.   Getting technical staff to visit premises urgently (who can survive without internet at home, especially if working from home) is impossible - join the waitlist of one or two weeks. "
4,minimal disruption once encountered. However solved it within an hour. And the staff was also very patient 
5,We have been suscribing to my republic for the past 4 years. Their customer service has been prompt and very helpful. We are very satisfied with their service. 
5,Used to subscribe to starhub previously and changed to my republic in 2016. I have not regretted the choice since then!!
5,Almost 3 years with MyRepublic - It has been a blast so far with minimal disruptions and the package they offer are awesome for gamers. Thank you :)
5,"Hi,Im with MyRepublic for about 7 years so far i have no issues with them.Price are also affordable.I usually chat with them via online chat.Tip Top service & prompt replies. There was 1 time when i were really have financial difficulties and my bill was almost due.I called them up and explained about my online selling and about the kids usage,thank God they extended my payment date another a week.Thank you for being understanding.I hope there's more offer coming up..Thanks"
5,I had been a customer of MyRepublic for almost 3 years now since moving to our new house. So far so good! No complaints on the broadband and home line. Thank you! 
5,"I've been a customer with MRP ever since I moved in to my new home 5 years ago, and I'm happy with the service that's been provided by the MRP team. Connections have been stable, and I've hardly faced any major disruptions to the internet.   There was however one incident where the connection was down for maintenance, but no notice/mail was sent as per procedure. MRP did an investigation, and apologised when they discovered that their system didn't send the necessary notifications.   That said, one major-ish incident in 5 years? I'd take that as a win.   Thanks MRP, and keep up the good work. :)"
5,"To be honest to all that myrepublic is doing great services so far. I'm using the myrepublic internet broadband and mobile line so far there is no distruption at all or any problem till now. These are my 3rd years using myrepublic broadband services and almost 1 year using myrepublic mobile services. Thumbs up for myrepublic great service provider broadband and mobile lines. Thank you so much and I want to keep carry on extending my broadband and mobile contract again and again with myrepublic. Great broadband and mobile services. Regards, Kamal."
4,"Have been your customer for 2 years and was satisfied with the speed of the board band provided. I don‚Äôt login cases often but even though, problem solved and responses are acceptable. "
5,I had subscript for my mum for quite sometime and itz work really well without hiccup. I really recommended this service and i will keep on prolong my subscription with service in many months and years to come. Thumb up!üëç
4,Good and reliable fibre services at reasonable pricing. Have not experienced any disconnection for more than 4 years of subscription. Highly recommend if you are looking to bundle with other tv services. Customer service could be improved.
5,Been using Myrepublic since 2013. Very satisfied user here. While the rest of the ISPs have some downtimes and disruptions here and there and always gets reported in the news. Myrepublic rarely does. Goes to show how stable the network is. But nothing is perfect of course. Once in 1-2 years there will be some minor intermittent but not a big deal. Overall an excellent ISP with very competitive pricing and speed.
4,"After signed up the broadband with Republic has been exciting and its comes with Hp notepad and does not lasts.. Recently the network is also quite slow. Hope can be improved. Overall, the usage is good...."
5,Great service provider and pricing is reasonable.Fast and stable connection so far! So far have not come across any issue with my Republic.Would highly recommend to anyone whose looking to sign up broadband services
4,"I have been with MyRepublic since they started that year.  To be honest. I would love to switch my current Telecom to MyRepublic but what I am aiming now is to have Multi Saver. So I can ask my whole family switch to MyRepublic Telecom. Broadband + 1 Telecom for 10% on Mobile. 2 Telecom has 15% each and 3 Telecom has 20% each. 4 Telecom has 25% each until max 5 telecom has 30% off rebate each bill. Ref friends to use Broadband FWB $2 each. Also, Ref friends to use Telecom $2 each phone bill. So far MyRepublic internet is good but not bundle good."
5,"My Republic has been a leader in high speed broadband for at least the past six years.  Anytime something has gone wrong (only once), they came to fix it straight away, quick and no charge.  Highly recommended."
5,I have been a loyal customer for My Republic at least for 6 years if im not mistaken. I even recieved a free ipad upon recontract for my broadband. Im glad My Republic recognised their loyal customers. I hope My Republic will give much more n even better reward for cutomers to recontract. Thus attract customers to stick n stay put with My Republic forever. Thank u 
5,Great service provider and pricing is reasonable. On that day of installation was on schedule and on time. 
5,"Great ISP. Stable 980+ Mbps connection for my Gigabit line, low ping in gaming sessions and fast downloads for my Steam and PS4 libraries."
5,Fast and stable connection so far!  Despite some reviews saying there's alot of problems others encountered. 
5,Loving the wifi speed of myrepublic  the only bad thing about it is the hotline. Taking too long to answer phone  calls. Other then that i do not have any problem with the wifi. Its the best eversince.
4,"I have been  with MyRepublic for last 2 years. It has been a smooth journey with them. N to make it smoother, im recontracting with them. THANKS!!! Keep it up MY REPUBLIC!!! "
5,I've been a satisfied customer of MyRepublic for years. It was the best decision made when I ended my contract with a popular broadband. Never turning back after experiencing no downtime on my internet.
5,Stable network. So far have not come across any issue with myRebublic. Would highly recommend to anyone whoes looking to sign up boardband services
5,I have been MyRepublic Broadband for about 3yrs....have serve me well with almost no issue at all. Thank you.
5,Thankyou to my republic cause they serve me so gd n very fast in respond the installation . I like it so much n enjoy my wifi broadband.
5,"the fibre network was fine and good condition. pros : highly recommend cons : sometimes, network was disputed. And call technical assistance, was too busy. So I waited for so long. I all always be patient."
5,"Have been subscribing MyRepublic since 2016 and thr services are excellence. No disruption has been encountered so far, with the competitive pricing and stable signalling, it definitely deserve the best fiber broadband in Singapore. Keep up the good service MyRepublic!"
5,Excellent coverage to our home and not laggy at all. We stream almost all our movies. Will go for mobile next.
5,have been using myrepublic for almost 3 years. They have a really good and easy to use online UI. Prize is competitve. Hope to give more perks for loyal customers.
5,Value for money Cheapest option  Wi-Fi works well So far I have no internet problem  If you have any problem can just call their hotline or email to them I solve the problem in a day customer service was quick response and easy to communicate  Will recommend to other friend 
5,"Has been using myrepublic for almost 1year. It may not be the cheapest but it network and speed is really steady. I have even great signal strenght  in my toilet, their sales team is also very responsive very truthful in what they are selling. Keep up the good work."
4,"I have switched to MyRepublic 2 years ago and so far so good except for times when internet is intermittent. Not sure why. I had to switched off the main switch then on it back again, then it works. There were several times such experience. Apart from this, it has been fine. I like how their price plans are competitive unlike the traditional telcos. They are also more creative in bundling their products. One suggestion is that, can My Republic offer solely the fibre without any router? It will help to reduce the monthly fees and i dont need the router when i already have one. Please give us such flexibility."
5,"Been using My Republic for 2 years and everything is fantastic! Everything is so simple and hassle free, even it‚Äôs  technical support is almost immediate!"
4,"Love the fibre broadband stability even with many devices connected at home. I played the online game without any problems that my friends face such as lagging or disconnection during gameplay. So far I recommended it to my friends. The customer services itself is ideal too other than the long waiting time on the phone which I felt could be improved, but overall services are ideal! Only one suggestion, they should have more promotions to keep current customers in the game!"
5,"I've switched my broadband plan over to MyRepublic 2 years ago & it's the only provider that never once had any internet breakdown. There are also constant maintenance done where we will be informed & the maintenance hours is usually in the wee hours so I am not affected at all.  Recently I just renewed the plan & the price is even lower now for the same plan! I also signed up the recent mobile promo for unlimited plan!  I believe the mobile line is gonna be as good as my broadband based in the past 2 years experience. The only area MyRepublic gotta improve might be the mobile phone models.  The choices are quite limited.  Other than this,  I would say you are my King of internet! üòÅ"
4,"Was renewing my 1st contract as it is expiring on 30/9/19.  For past 2yrs, not to said there are non hiccups to the boardbands, but it is still within acceptance basis... compare to others service providers, it is considered perfect.  So I have get my friends to switch over from red to MyRepublic for goods.  But the handphone internet data service was unacceptable... or said horrible.  To many of others service providers line in my family.  Only encountered MyRepublic to charges extra then fixed price, for calls or data makes to England, which I never had called or used before.  Upon many times of following up, the someone told me the oversea charges is because of Facebook login.  What the hell is that? Can‚Äôt accept, and finally put to an end with the mobile  Internet service.  Overall, I would still strongly recommending MyRepublic boardbands service. "
5,"My recent experience with MyRepublic, was mixed. Whilst I wished the management could have done more, I am very pleased with the retention officer Ms Lee Hui Shan's professionalism. Her service was excellent  she was patient and knowledgeable. Hui Shan must also be commended for making suggestions to safeguard client's interest at heart. Kudos to MyRepublic for having her in raising the bar level of service."
4,Believe it‚Äôs been stable and haven‚Äôt had any issue so overall satisfactory however certainly there‚Äôs a room to improve which may attract or boost customer to retain the services like waiving off relocation fee .
4,"The fibre broadband internet service was stable and uptime was uninterrupted during my 2 years + so far. I believe reliability is the main factor everyone is looking for. Keep up the good work in that regard! The promotion bundles are so far largely attractive to encourage sign-ups although the 'Friends with Benefits' program needs to be further developed. The referral program needs to be expanded to all and any type of normal promotion and not restrict new sign-ups to a few limited and unimaginative promotions. It leaves a sore aftertaste in the part of the referrer if the referral does not like any of the limited promotions that qualify under the 'Friends with Benefits' program and signs up for a promotion that is outside of the program. The customer service officer that I have interacted with is helpful and is able to propose a meaningful solution. Kudos for that! Continue developing a respectful, helpful and humanised approach with your backend team. It‚Äôs the key difference whether a customer recontracts or not."
2,Hi I have recieved a sms with regard to my recontract thst will due soon.  Attached with a link to recontract with a lower price by 30 Sep 2019. Unforturnately upon trying to login it‚Äôs says I‚Äôm not valid for recontracting. Is that a spam that I have recvd ?
5,Awesome service. No regret changing away Red and Green. After using MyRepulic Broadband no D/C problem for me! Will continue using it.
3,Wifi signal is super weak...  When I went in my master bedroom...  Totally no signal at all...  2 routers already then some more one of the router is at the room beside master bedroom
4,"My republic has wider wifi connection and no hidden charges for payment, however, we experience intermittent lagging. I hope they will consider the feedbacks and find solutions for the lagging issues."
5,"I am into my 4th year the Myrepublic, so far the internet connection has never failed me. I remember my interaction with them is always positive from sign up to renewal, all seamless. And they were able to expedite the activation when i shift house. Hope they will continue to offer great package and speed to us consumer. "
3,"The line is unstable and the wifi isn‚Äôt strong as what the salesman told us. When loading YouTube or online movie still hanging and wasn‚Äôt smooth at all. Only 4 persons sharing the wifi but the loading is terrible. First time user, and maybe the last time."
5,"I have been using their internet service for years. Reliable, fast and convenient. Excellent, the internet has not down while I am using and will continue using their service.  Recently I have started using their mobile. It has been excellent so far. "
3,"My Republic internet connection is great. Have been using them for about 4 years, so far no issue encoutered.   The only issue i encounter and i think they should improve on is the call waiting time. It usually takes me about 15mins to call through. Seems like their customer service officer is always too busy. Sometimes this just irritates me. "
4,I have been using my republic broadband for a few years now so far the service is good but sometimes the connection is lagging so hopefully can improve on that other than that happy that there is cheap offers and it gets cheaper when continuing the contract with them
5,"I've been using MyRepublic for over a year, both broadband and mobile, the service is great I can't complain at all, service is reliable, fast and convenient. And they'll give you discount or more GB if you use both services! "
2,"Honestly speaking I have a problem with your quick suspension of broadband service due to outstanding even only a month late in payment.   Your reactivation fee of $43 is alot. A warning say a week before suspension is greatly appreciated. My contract is ending next month, not sure to continue or go with Whiz..."
5,"I have no problem with My Republic, my internet connection is always stable, I also I like that it doesn't send paper invoices and that is more environmentally friendly."
4,"Has been w MyRepublic for broadband for almost one year. Sign up was easy, internet service reliable, installation staff hit n miss (still polite just that some are more helpful and provide more instructions rather than just set up and go). Price is ok too but just hope can waive relocation fee "
5,I have switched my fibre broadband from Singtel to MyRepublic and their connection is more stable and reliable than Singtel. I do not face any drop connections especially between 9.45pm to 10.15pm every night. Will remains my first choice as of now. 
5,"I've been using myrepublic broadband for more than 3 years and till date I have yet to call them for technical support, unlike other provider. Thank you myrepublic. "
2,The broadband was really lousy. My masterbed room was a wifi dead zone. Been using for more than 1 year plus but connection was damn poor. Contract will end soon to in few months time. Thinking of switching to another Telco for better connection üëç
3,Honestly speaking your (MyRepublic) broadband is satisfying/good with no issues BUT would be good if a WARNING of at least a week or 3days notice is given before any suspension is done.   You have suspended many times and $40 of reactivation fee is alot of money. 
3,Overall the service is good but the internet connection is very slow at times it could be better if my republic work on it individually to check on all customers internet connection consistantly in the system it will help and make the customer more satisfied 
5,"I have been with myrepublic for more than 4 years. The internet is pretty consistent and fast. When there was an issue with the issued router, they changed it free of charge and without any fuss. "
5,"I've previously tried other internet service providers and I'm new to MyRepublic's internet service. Have previously encountered a bit of an issue as i am using my own router. Despite that, their service team attends to me patiently and helped me resolve my issues. Personally, i love to do a speed test from time to time to check on the consistency of my internet speed and MyRepublic have not disappoint me. Their internet service and their technical support team on the back end makes the whole experience positive as their technicians is knowledgable regarding the system and advices accordingly to our needs. Definitely a MyRepublic convert now!"
5,Have been using my republic for about 9 months and so far nothing to complain about. Connection is fast and good and internet has never been down. Pricing is also competitive in the market. No regrets. Will definitely recontract with them when the time is up!
4,"The veocity is excellent. I have some issues to discuss: - I cannot link my cellphone with the TV, looks like a problem with the MyRepublic Firewall - Sometimes the internet just go away for some secs and then return"
3,"I have referred a friend to sign up but we didn't get the rebate which was advertised, so misleading. Connectivity wise everything is pretty good."
3,Being using for quite a few years but recently the network seems to give some problem even when the router is just next to laptop or phone. Land line is also has crossed line issues but didn‚Äôt use much so not much problem but it will be good if can fix it. 
5,"application is smooth, customer service is responsive to email. broadband services is stable. when downtime is require, email will be sent from myrepublic to inform us on the period.  before signing up for republic received a feedback from a friend that customer service was pretty bad several years ago. looks like this is a thing of the past.  Would suggest MyRepublic to expand its mobile services. No contract plan is good but would also suggest to introduce contract plan which hopefully can reduce the sale price of the phone. Some companies provide monthly mobile claims which is why many of us would prefer to get a contract plan so we pay less for the phone and take advantage from the company's benefit. As well as the variety of phones provided.  a happy customer 2 years old"
5,"Never had much issues for the past 6 yrs. Speed and connection is good 99% of the time. Love the choices and  options available during recont everytime. For most importantly, affordable pricing for the speed. "
5,"I am a subscriber of MyRepublic 1gbs fibre plan for 23 months now. There is no lag on the internet, and I did not encounter any issue with the network. YOUTUBE plays without lagging... I love MyRepublic Fibre. I suggest MyRepublic have a point syst where subscribers earn points for paying bills and can exchange for bill rebates or exclusive merchandise"
5,Service provided by myrepublic family is way better than those high end brands. Extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Plans they offered are also very affordable and good. Definately recommended!
5,I'm using this service for 4 years it's very good I just renew the contract car getting low price. The network speed is good
5,"Value for money, low latency, very happy with the service. The only issue is the WiFi Halo router is not as good as high end router in market and it doesn't support NAS."
5,Thankyou myrepublic. The last time I signed up for my wifi was way above $100. Now I already $50. Every month I only pay $50. Oh yes! The customer service was super top notch! Kudos team! The connection is super fast. I will definitely refer to my peers for sure! Thanx again!
5,Great  company  still waiting patiently for our cash to deduct from my account if hv cash will surely  give them  no matter  how...  Thanks republic 
4,We have been MyRepulic  Broadband user for more than 5 years. Basically we are satisfied with the service and plan renew the service next year.
5,Friendly and professional service. Renewing my broadband through phone is a breeze. Will recommend to my friends üòâ
5,cheap and reliable bundle for wifi  i believe that eventho it is relatively new the wifi connection is nothing short of good and reliable.I have been using it for a year plus now and everything is smooth.Paying only 55 dollars monthly it is a very good deal
2,"Everything good except installation charge too high , until i commited then i was quoted there is a installation charge , wont subscribe to My Republic after contract , after subscribe to MR , Starhub offer similiar plan , with free installations and 25% discount . If Starhub can , why MR cannot waive off installation fee ? Or lower charge  ? "
5,"I'm a MyRepublic user since 2014, they are probably the best you can have for a reasonable price. I love how they have scheduled maintenance to keep up the servers and will always send you notification of the scheduled downtime. MyRepublic rarely has downtime compared to other providers, their customer service is also the best, very responsive and helpful."
5,"Recommended for any one who wants to have fibre broadband. Though quite pricey but all in all, good service and good product. Fast connections and very rare downtime."
5,"We are one of the very early supporters of My Republic, and we are happy to see it grow to what it is today. Ray was the CSO whom I chatted with online to help me resolve my recontract. He was very helpful over the chat and very attentive and patient.  Although I had to do it by myself, Ray was there throughout my journey. Feedback for company, suggest to allow CSO to help in the recontracting process, as some older subscribers may not be conversant with things online. Overall, wonderful experience. Keep it up and keep the big boys a good run on their money!! "
5,"Was quite pissed off with my previous internet provider. Decided to make the jump to MyRepublic immediately and signed up during the IT Show. Although the monthly pricing is quite pricey as compared to other internet provider, There were not many downtime encountered. Equipment is user friendly. Connection speed is a million times faster than my previous provider. Just recontracted with MyRepublic this year. I do hope to see more promotions for existing customers. Highly recommend to those who are frustrated with their current internet provider. "
5,"I have been using my republic service for about 3 years. So far, my experience has been fantastic from the time I signed up to the setting up and even the customer service. I have no problem with the speed unlike my previous experience with another ISP. Overall, very good.  "
4,Value for money. Pretty simple and straightforward application process. Reception is relatively good too. Had a good experience with the customer service and I liked it that they had a messaging system to get in touch with them. Only down side is that they do not have a private number service aka non-caller id. 
5,"Great value for $$, great speed and good quality of network.  Fantastic bundle of premiums. Loving it! Not forgetting great post sales support and ease of bill payment!! Keep up the good work Team MR! "
5,One of the best broadband in sg with fastest speed..  anyone should apply republic mobile broadband!!!!
4,"Connection is much better than the other so-called national Telco. Customer service is also better, at least i don't have to be put on hold 30 mins whenever I called the other Telco 168x hotline. No regret in switching over. "
5,Better connection as compared to the other service provider I subscribed to. Great service from the staff. 
3,"I have signed a total of 2 contracts with MR each 24mths, the 2nd contract being a result of their good network performance, sales attitude and price-to-value proposition in the 1st.   I'm approaching the end of my 2nd contract and I'm contemplating switching out. Like what others have shared, the network service is getting bad, keep getting ping timeouts, page URLs slow in getting resolved. Having their service deteriorated, plus with so many other providers on the market, at the same price point, it's a no-brainer for any savvy consumer to take this opportunity to try out another provider."
5,Ive been with MYrepublic for quite some time now. ...with only one DECO device...after 2yrs i sign new contract with promotion and i got extra 2more DECO device...with each room equip with that device... Wowww...the coverage and speed is EXCELLENT...so far till now nothing to feedback...  Good job MYREPUBLIC!!! 
5,"I have already with My republic for 3 years, good network coverage and customer service. Will continue with them."
3,Basically good enough to use. Speed wise is okay. The only thing is when you switch on the router it will take bit of time for my hp Wi-Fi to be connected. 
1,"My connection has been problematic for months and they have yet to find a solution. Night time WiFi connection is so poor but could be due to interference. However, it means their ‚Äúbest‚Äù router Halo is poor at overcoming interference. Overall, very disappointed."
3,"This is my third year with MyRepublic. Sign on a 2 year contract as I was attracted by the ""free"" laptop. The network seems to be quite weak at the wee hours perhaps they are doing maintenance work. Getting worse this few months as network was bad at night thus I use my own mobile data instead. Wanted to sign up their mobile contract but since network at night is not as stable, I still have not sign up."
5,Im with Myrepublic for 2 years already. Broadband speed is good and minimum downtime. Recontracted with them again this year online. Online chat is quick and response is good. Reply to my queries were attended to within 3 working days.
5,The wifi coverage is really good as compared to others that I have tried previously. Monthly subscription price is also very affordable. Will definitely keep using MyRepublic as our home broadband. üí™üèª
5,Had been a customer with Myrepublic since 2011 with stable connectivity and less downtime.  Had recommended friends and relatives to use them as plans are value for money
2,Connection is cranky at night. Sometimes there's no connection at all.  Not sure what if you can do anything to improve the connectivity.
4,"overall still good, this is my fourth year. customer service and technical help is friendly and helpful too when i have connection issues. hope can maintain this standard. thanks."
2,"The Wi-Fi internet seems slow at night, and I'm charged late payment charges when sufficient funds are in my bank. I can't wait for it to expire so I could stick to my previous Telco."
5,"Their customer service is very polite and prompt. I remember updating my credit card information and I managed to do so via a website, and it only took me 2 mins. Efficient!"
5,I've been using MyRepublic since the first few batches of new user. They have grown and improved the connectivity over the years and up till now i'm still using their service.  Keep up the great work and thank you for providing us the service.
4,I was once a starhub user and switch to MyRepublic only 2 years ago. It‚Äôs really fast and doesn‚Äôt have a problem like my previous subscriber. I like it and recommend MyRepublic to my friends. However they need to buck up their call center. 
5,Have been with MyRepublic since their first year. Have been enjoying referral fees by asking my handful of friends to choose MyRepublic. Recontract also have good offers like free 5 and 4 months on my last 2 renewal contracts. Always stay connected and even that's a maintenance at night. It's always soon over. Good Cust service follow up when I call up for the digital voice line issues. Also took the promo 8 dollars Sim plan. I am so addicted to ur pricing and been savings alot. Thanks for ur great service and good plans. Definitely my first choice and will continue to influence my friends to choose u guys. U r the best! 
5,Since the day i subcribed MyRepublic as my broadband provider.....i don't find any problems and i would highly recommended to anyone who need it...thank you MyRepublic
5,"Been with MyRepublic the longest I could remember. I was first referred by my colleague, then I had to convince my parents to make a switch and now I go around proudly sharing with everyone who my Internet provider is. For its efficiency in service support, to awesome Internet plans that suit all walks of lives. What's best about MyRepublic? Advance notices of scheduled maintenance. Which Internet provider would do that?! "
5,I'll believed i hv make a right choice for using My Republic broadband and will continue the service.cheers 
3,"I've been a loyal customer to myrepublic for almost 5 years now after switching from starhub. So far i do not have any problem but until i sign up for the Uno mobile plans that was offered to customer who sign up during their trial period which i have to pay monthly for $8. It was good until i notice that if i were to pay late example due date is on the 2nd of each month if i pay late on the 4th or 6th they will cut off the mobile phone. And i have to call customer service to have it reconnect back and by far i have been paying 5 times for the reconnection fees! So much for being loyalty! I always informed them i cannot paid on time as my salary can come in early or late but still this problem came in and when i asked them to check my pattern of payment method etc they always said yes we understand but still there is always disruptions! But over all i would said its worthy that i switch from starhub to them. Just a little of understanding between myrepublic and the customer will be good, or at least check how each customer payment pattern."
3,"Been their user for 3 years, initially had a messy account with them because of my address  issues, but they were nice and lenient enough not to send harsh and scary lawyer letters to threaten us like other telcos....    But sadly they do not have much mobile phone selections , it would be nice if they could have more models and older models than new models.... Not everybody can afford a fancy fancy handphone and a fancy monthly bill..... "
5,Have been with My Republic for as long as I can remembered... There was never any issue at all. I would have to say My Republic have done a very good job. Thank you for the broadband service.
5,MR has been providing excellent service eversince i sign up with the Broadband Service.From there on i follow up with its News and Promotion where i happen to saw it promotion for its New Mobile Sim Card back then.i eventually sign up for 3 Sim Cards for my family and till now it has been providing great service.Ever call up their Customer Service before and they give the best of their service to assist me.Thumbs Up MyRepublic Team.Fullest Star i give to MyRepublic services   
5,"Coming to my 3rd year wif My Republic, and i got no issue with it.. Customer service operator was also friendly and willingly to help with all my enquiry.. Connection and no lagging issue.. most of my family and friends are also with My Republic  Definitely recommend to others.. Thumbs up..."
5,Been using Myrepublic wifi for 2 years and all I can say is highly recommended to all and by far the best and most consistent in terms of internet speed and connection among the other providers. Very minimum downtime and a lot of good deals offer from time to time when nearing recontract period. Thank you Myrepublic Wifi!
5,"fast Ôºå stableÔºå affordable , no hidden cost ! But the mobile Sim online plan is a little pricy compare to other telco . "
4,"The internet speed and service is not too bad, however router provided(AC1600) has weak wifi output."
5,"My 4th year with them. So far connection is good,no complains. Call center is good,explain in details. Keep up the good work"
4,"I am a basic broadband user and a newbie to My Republic. As cable broadband comes to an end, shopping around with the other ISPs show that (to me) they are more interested to sell content (read TV programmes) than basic fibre broadband service. My Republic's service is so far so good. Thank you."
5,"Switch to myrepublic since 2016. No much laspe was observed, no issue with connection, all so good. Highly recommend to all"
4,"Stable connectivity, prompt billing, excellent customer service. Reliable wifi and value for money plans!"
4,I am happy with My republic offering with No contract services. Despite the initial cost is high but I like such package. 
5,"I am a loyal supporter of My republic for the past few years, no issues with yr service etc. Which is why i decided to recommend u to my client, i was the one signing up on their behalf and etc, but because i couldn't find or failed to key in my referral code during sign up, i wasn't given my referral fee. Despite 3 calls to yr service centre, i am disappointed by the robot treatment from your stuff. I would have appreciated some flexibility on your end. The referral fee might be a small amount but it speaks volume on your generosity.  Cheers"
5,My area Blk 119 Bedok North Road. I started my fibre with them ever since they start. Issues with the line since 2012 is less than 10 times. Highly recommended and thank you for providing us the best ever!!!!!!!
5,Excellent network. Had been using it passed 3 years. Always stable n fast connection. When call customer service for enquiries.. They are all friendly n helpful. Tq
4,"Have been with MyRepublic since they entered the Singapore market.  Their initial service levels were bad; eg the installation service agent was most unhelpful; the renewal process was non-existent. You only knew your contract was over when you noticed your monthly bill jumped.   Since then, they have improved tremendously in all areas, but I can only give them a thumbs up when I see what happens during my next contract renewal process."
5,I don‚Äôt game at all. Basic surfing without issues. Hope to be provided with cheaper alternative for non gaming families 
4,"I had been a MYR user since it was launched. Singtel service was just crap and I had just about enough if their customer service. Was on game plan since day 1 and there was fixed IP address with a slew of other benefits including home voice.  Recently I decided to downgrade from gamer to standard plan as I had cut down on gaming. To my horror, my speed had slowed down by a fair bit including download and uploading speeds. I guess my IP had been migrated from a dedicated gamer plan server to a mass server.   In terms of pricing, I am one to use my own hardware and not rely much on the hardware provided or recommended by MYR. But in lieu of current market, I think my $49 standard price plan with slower speeds is just not a bargain anymore. And it is like I m paying more for a fixed IP when other providers are also giving $39 plans with the same speed and benefits. Maybe it is time to go ala Carte for broadband prices, similar to current mobile plans.  Sadly, I m stuck in a contract and I dun expect MYR to change my contract. But if they do offer a better package, maybe they can prove me wrong that they are still a market trend setting company."
5,"Application was smooth and Swift. Customer service resolved my problems pretty quick as they understood my problem once I told them about it.  Only setback was installation could be done on weekdays and not weekends. Apart from that, definitely worth recommending myrepublic!"
5,"What can i say? You guys are the BEST! Fast speed, fast service, next to zero downtime. Renew again have more discount where to find huh?"
3,"Hi I am 2nd time customer,  previously the router I used are much stable and reliable but not sure why after subscribes the 2nd time with this free router the speed and stability are worse than the 1st router. I will need your advice. "
5,Speed is good. No lagging. Never experience out of connection. It would be better if could provide better recontract promotion for long term customer.
5,"It‚Äôs been great so far, fast internet and good service. I didn‚Äôt have any problems except for a land line that is tied to my broadband package. I had an issue with my modem and was rectified with a good and professional officer. "
5,"With Travel Protect360, you can be ready for all your adventures and travel with peace of mind.Enjoy Hassle-free Post-Journey Medical Claims"
5,Fuss free travel insurance with up to 60% off regularly. Claim experience is good and contact centre officer is very friendly
1,"Please do not buy Travel Insurance from Hong Leong Travel Insurance, claims submission done in June and till now Sep, there is no response from them."
1,"Luggage was delayed on the return trip from Japan back to Singapore for 24 hours, but was told that my insurance does not cover the return trip for delayed baggage back from your home country. This was inside the fine prints that were sent to you through email after paying for the insurance which most people are not aware of before making purchase."
1,"When claim my damaged luggage of original cost $69, they took me one and a half month, and after several calls I made to them, they asked for original purchase invoice, upon saying I can't find it, the person at the other side of phone line then decided on the spot saying ""$10 is ok then"". Mind that, the slow claim process, the lack of professional way of handling my claim, aside from that you had better satisfy the required proof they printed in small wording in the terms and conditions, this makes the worst experience I ever dealt with many travel insurance claims. Note above my own experience only."
1,"Purchase is easy and usually will get the most expensive premium thinking that the most basic would be covered. Like theft in Europe is really common, so when i was robbed and lost everything; thought that it will be alright as I was covered for. That was when the nightmare started, HLAS don't cover for mobile devices such as mobile phones, ipad and limited cash. After more than 2 months of calling their call centres and repeated documents(same docs) submissions.So if you are looking to purchase a expensive amulet, then this for you, calms the mind when you dont need it, when you need it, then this may not really work. You just can wish for it to. "
4,Got my payout 2 months after filing a claim on travel delay (6 hours). Helpful service. Price is reasonable.
2,"There are a lot of exclusions in the fine print that you should take note of for  which were not found on the T&C of the policy documents i found online but were present in the policy sent to me, for e.g. : ""up to a maximum of thirty (30) days from the date of first treatment in Singapore, subject to a limit of up to $100 per visit."".  $100/visit is a very stringent criteria, a trip to the A&E alone is already $120"
5,"Brought from HL a few years back and had to claim for overseas hospitalization. Staff was helpful and process was easy! Remember that the reimbursement came quickly, within 2 weeks. Would definitely recommend if the price difference from other plans isn't that huge. "
3,Bought Hong Leong travel insurance once it was the cheapest travel insurance listed on Gobear at that point of time. Did not have to claim anything (fortunately!) but i wouldn't mind getting travel insurance from them again. 
4,"4 stars because i've bought it with ease and great price. online platform seems very straightforward, and you can see them literally everywhere in the social media.  the best part, i get to reserve the Changi WiFi toggle for the first time! buying HL travel insurance definitely gives me the advantage in booking 1.  the missing 1 star because i have not claimed before to truly say that this is an EXCELLENT product.  TBC"
3,"If you read the fine print, there are a lot of exclusions that cannot be claimed. Compared to other insurances, it is definitely cheaper but at same time you are exposed to more risks of not getting any money after incident. I personally will not recommend this plan after trying last year. After a 8 h flight delay and 23 h baggage delay, I was not able to claim a single cent due to the amount of criteria to satisfy in their fine print."
5,"Just would like to emphasize on the importance of Travel insurance especially when you've spent thousands on tour packages.  In light of the most recent case, konsortium closing down, many were affected and many could have covered the unexpected loss with comprehensive coverage travel insurance.  Also remember to know what you're being covered when you buy. (:"
5,"It is one of the great card to own it as the rewards system makes me spend even more.   As i spend more for shopping, the rewards allows me to earned more at the same time."
5,CITI Rewards Card Great card for my shopping and dining needs. There is even promotions for online purchases.
5,"Use this card more for you to earn points and you are able to redeem points to air miles , free hotel, travel to other hotel in other country "
5,"Good card for online purchases. However, there's a monthly cap of 1k. 4 miles per dollar, what's not to love."
4,"My first choice when buying clothes, bags or shoes. It is even more versatile now that it give points for online purchases."
5,"4mpd for retail shopping, and 4mpd for all online purchases except travel. What more can you ask for? Any more they might as well give you 4mpd for all purchases. If only the cap was more than $1000/month..."
5,"Had been using this citibank rewards card for many years.  What I love is: 1) The  10X Rewards points on my shopping all year long; be it online or offline or overseas. It makes shopping more rewarding 2) And Citibank has an amazing range of merchandise for you to redeem using your rewards points, my favourite has always been using my reward points to get Takashimaya vouchers which has no expire date 3) Citibank is also always been very prompt and hassle free in waiving my annual fee and also late payment finance charges "
1,"THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU APPLY FOR CITIBANK CREDIT card especially if you are always travel and can't keep track on the date. Secondly, there isn't many perks. The customer service is based in Manila which take at least 15 minutes waiting time to speak to someone and line is absolutely lousy.  NONE A SINGLE ISSUE will be resolved even if you speak to them. Go for UOB & AMEX for overseas and daily used! HIGHLY RECOMMEND UOB & AMEX!!!!    Not even worth 1 star"
1,"Truly regret that I had chosen this card. I have never received so-called vouchers for all the points I accumulated. Raised the issue numerous times via phone and in person, but all the efforts were in vain.   Will never apply for any Citibank credit cards again."
5,"Best card ever. Been using their Citibank Credit Cards still 30 years ago. They are the pioneers of cashback cards in Singapore - changing from their Dividend card to Cashback card.  Getting cash back by charging to the card. Getting rebates or discounts for lazada, purchases and Petrol station top up too."
5,"Best card I have as i get the most rebates or miles out of it. On lazada membership giving lots of rebates for lazada (now 8% rebates), Grab and Chope and RedMart purchases and most miles for most online shopping. I only use this card for the 4x miles return for the above and avoid using it when it gives me less than that equivalent. "
5,Pros:  - 10X Rewards points for on online purchases within certain categories  - Rewards catalog is pretty alot. Am eyeing some of the rewards  Cons  - 1X Rewards points for every else  Generally a good card to get 10x rewards points for Lazada purchases. Just a alternative card to use when my other credit cards doesnt have rebates for some purchases so i can at least get 1x Reward points.
5,"Absolutely brilliant card. Best in the market right now when paired with Apple Pay to give 20x Citi Dollars, with no cap, and 10x Citi Dollars on a good range of stuff. This is my number 1 card right now, and if you have an iPhone, I highly recommend adding this card into your Apple wallet right now.  If I were to be really fussy, then the only downside is that bonus points are capped at SGD 12k worth of spending per year, and points across all Citi cards don't pool, but that's not a reason for avoiding the card. The benefits hugely outweigh the costs and I strongly recommend this card if you want to gain miles at an unbelievable speed."
5,"A great card for shopping.  Pros 10x/4mpd if you spend within the bonus categories Certain promotion will give 20x/8mpd (Eg: Current promo: Applypay with Citi Rewards = 20x till end Jul 18) Larger pool of airline partners compared to other banks  Cons Points don't pool 120k point cap for 10x ($12k spending), any other spend above that will give 1x... (You can apply for both visa and master variant if you need to increase the point cap, just note that points from both cards don't pool despite being a ""citi rewards card"")"
5," One of my fav credit cards for shopping online and in department stores.  Pros 1) the card offer 10X Rewards (equivalent to 4 miles per dollar) on online purchases within certain categories  2) same bonus earn rate for eligible expenses that are charged to the card physically - this includes shopping at department stores as well as many other retail stores that sell shoes, clothes or bags.  3) Citi Rewards Visa Cardholders can also benefit from 20X Rewards (8 miles per dollar!) With certain vendors from time to time  Cons  1) poor earn rate on non shopping related categories   Get this card if you Shop often !"
5,You have made my encounter with etiqa happy and smooth! Life has never been the same again.  Thank you! 
4,"Just signed-up, so far the lowest annual fee (with no tiered investment amount) among all robo advisors & the only one to charge a performance fee. Let's see how this one does!   (i) Annual Management Fee 0.50 per cent per annum - calculated and paid daily based on the daily average market value of portfolio assets.  (ii) Performance Fee 10 per cent of the annual absolute return with highwater mark, calculated and pro-rated after each calender year-end, and paid in arrears."
5,"I attended their workshop. It was very informational. It uses pure AI and machine learning to manage portfolio, so it works 24/7! It also uses gamification to determine our risk profile. The UI is beginner friendly so it is suitable for wide range of users. I believe machine learning and AI is the future for investing!"
3,Great designs on the card faces. Appealing to a younger demographic but there isn't much going for it other than that. 
1,"OCBC FRANK card WAS one of the best cards in the market for the millennial. However, after they changed their rebate conditions it became a very lousy card. It was fun and interesting to customize the card at first, but that is not enough for me to retain the card, especially with DBS Live Fresh coming into the picture. All the promotions done for this card (i.e. Movie Tickets for every Frank card sign up vs. $20/$100 cash credit for DBS Live Fresh) became lousy or even simply just stopped. Don't bother wasting your time with this card "
3,"Can use as ez link, atm card, credit card. Many many extremely many unique card face to choose from. One of the entry level card for fresh grad. "
2,"Beside having nice card designs, this card is very much a basic card which suitable for young adults and students profile. Not much perks "
4,"A good starter card for students since the main appeal comes form the various card designs they can choose from. Otherwise, there are better cards out there for the working adults."
3,"Only good for student, as is free and won‚Äôt require for minimum deposit. Once you start work already you will find there are a lot more better account in the market that give higher returns. "
3,"It is good for student but has age limitation, so my friends cannot apply for it. It is a bit frustrated, so he chose DBS"
2,"FRANK credit card: the rebates of 6%, 5% are attractive w relatively lower min spending of $400. but the S$400 has to be in-store spending FRANK Credit Card (excluding Online, EZ-Link Top-ups and Transit Link related transaction). Then it becomes very sian because most shopping and deals are online but have to find somewhere to spend $400 to get the higher rewards of online spending. "
3,"Lousy rebates recently but I still use this card because I like the designs haha it is an ok card for students (with low volume of purchases) to get and use since atms are readily accessible. If you encounter fraudulent charges, the bank is quick to freeze the transactions and your card + inform you :)"
4,"this is a good card for students, but there are better ones out there when you start working. Hence, get it when you are a student, and then just ignore it once you have better options "
3,"Got this card free a few years back as a student because it was fun. shortly after i graduated, this card lost it's appeal and easily replaced by most other cards in the market. "
2,"Got this card free a few years back as a student because it was fun and customisable but that was it, rebates were not that great. Could easily be replaced with another card nowadays. "
3," This was one of my earliest cards during uni because i thought it was cool to choose a card design.   I unfortunately don't shop much both online and offline to reap sufficient benefits, so I've cancelled this card.   Nonetheless if you're considering this, can read up on the frank account and their young investors programme. "
3,"Best for online shopping at 6% rebates, but have to meet minimum $400 offline spending. For somebody who does almost all my shopping online, I've moved away from this card."
4,"Compared to OCBC 365 card, The OCBC frank card is a better alternative for online shoppers (Frank has 6% rebate, overall bill rebate is capped at $60 per month). Useful card to pay for your hotel bookings). Hence, the FRANK card is highly recommended as a credit card for booking your accommodations or even air tickets.  Good for movie tickets purchase as well with its 5% rebate across all cinemas; however for GV tickets purchase, I will still recommend using HSBC card for its GV privileges. Good card losing to BOC Family card in most aspects, EXCEPT when it comets to online purchases."
5,"One of the must have credit card if you are accumulating miles (Paywave/Contactless spending = 4 miles per dollar).  Easily the most used card. Just beware of the monthly spending limit ($1,000), points are awarded in blocks of $5 and the merchants that do not award UNI$ (miles) but Smart$ (cashback)."
5,"One of the rare cards that rewards 4miles per dollar when you -using paywave,  -shop online.  with almost no requirements and a rather high 1k monthly cap for the above bonus miles.  combine this with uob privi miles - you will be on your way to many free trips round the world"
4,"Found out about this recently. A good card if you want miles! Gives 4 miles per dollar spent if you use paywave (but only if you spend a minimum of $5)! Also gives 4 miles per dollar spent on popular sites such as fave and qoo10!  Downside is, it took me 5 weeks to get the card. I applied for it, called them 2 weeks later when I didn't receive the card, and they said the card was likely lost in mail. They sent me another, and the same thing happened. Called them again, and this time I received it one week later. Took a total of 5 weeks to receive. Not sure if UOB or SingPost is at fault."
4,"I have been using this card for years together with UOB Preferred Platinum Amex card. This is good for small expenditure to accumulate UNI$. I especially like the 10 times UNI$ for spending online and VISA paywave. As there is a cap on UNI$ earned, I do not recommend this for high expenditure though. But as my spending is moderate, this card is good for me. "
5,"I have invested in 9 loan deals thus far in the past 11 months, of which, 6 has been fully repaid and 3 pending repayments. I have not experienced a default but 1 loan deal experienced a slight delay on repayment (but has since been fully settled with further late interest payments) while another is still pending a late repayment. Minterest team follows up closely with late repayments and update investors as soon as there are new developments. The team is also relatively accessible and responds very quickly. Overall, I am very happy with investing on Minterest's platform and will continue to use them.   Pros  Due diligence is carried out by a team of ex bankers that apply their combined experience in banking. That gives me comfort as opposed to some young entrepreneurs starting a pipe dream in P2P lending.  Minterest core team is made up of people with integrity. Do try to get to know them and speak to them as they are the key people approving and listing the loan deals.  User interface makes it easy to browse loan deals and invest.  No fees for investors and attractive interest yields (12-24%) for investors.  No hidden fees  Cons  Parts of the platform may need initial explanation by Minterest team. The user platform can also be a little confusing with regards to showing schedule of payments as well as total current investments. Good thing is the team is on hand to field any queries fast!  Good deals (safe deals IMHO) get snapped out rather quickly.  What to watch out for:  Despite the credit ratings given by the Minterest team, I suggests fellow investors to do their own due diligence on the companies taking out loans with Minterest, at the very least, understand the business model and the macro business environment they operate in.   Also, do take note of the difference between a one time repayment vs monthly repayments for the loans as there is a difference in the rate of returns.   This is a new world of loans and you can very well lose all your investment if the SME you loan to defaults. The onus is on the investor to take responsibility for each investment that you invest in. With regards to Minterest‚Äôs platform risk, I feel that the risk of Minterest winding down is low as Minterest is a well capitalized P2P company   Do not just focus on the yields, focus on the downside risks (basically the credit risks of the particular SME taking the loan). "
4,"Minterest is the third crowdfunding platform I have signed on to and they have been very proactive in responding to investor queries whether through WhatsApp, Telegram or email. The team running Minterest has created multiple channels for feedback and promptly answers any questions especially from retail investors who might not be as familiar with fintech as institutional investors. They have taken these feedback on board and implemented them on their platform whether it is lowering the minimum investment amount or improving the display on their website. One future improvement to make could be to come up with a mobile app which makes it even more convenient for investors."
4,"Good lending platform with experienced ex bankers. They boost their service among investors with effective communications using telegrams. They drop their minimum investment per funds from $500 to $100 to $50 to meet the needs of small investors to diversify their risks. With their new personal loan service, qiannow,  Minterest will have the most diversified p2p platform. They have loans range from capital-guaranteed loans to riskier loans of higher interest "
4,"Minterest now requires min $1k per deposit, but only a minimum withdrawal of $0.01. So if you want to put in $500 instead, put a 1k deposit and 500$ withdrawal.  So far did not encountered an defaults with 9 lending. Back in 2018 when i first tried it out, most investments have a min amount of $500, but 2019 has seen it being reduced to $100 and less.   If you did not manage to be allocated with autobot, you are most likely not be able to succeed investing manually. It snaps up as fast as those $0.99 deals in eCommerce sites.   UI is more informative than Funding societies. Navigating through website is a breeze.   Somehow i am glad that it does not require 2FA - at least not yet.   Dislikes the default apge shown after login though. Why can't it defaults to my dashboard or ""Browse Funding request"" page instead of having to click on the """"Browse Funding request"" button?"
5,"The interface is generally easy to use and the fact sheets very useful in assessing the investment.  I hope that they will have more high returns investments at 20% soon.   The auto invest is an great feature as it prevents investors from having to rush online at a specific time. All in all, a pretty good platform so far, even though as a new investor I haven‚Äôt yet received any returns."
4,Minterest is a user friendly and supportive p2p platform. I like it's telegram platform where I can check on issues or post questions if any. It would be good if the platform is able to provide more information on payment dates and defaults if any for the deals. 
5,"I have been using Minterest since Q1 2019.  Overall I think that the company is well run, crediting money is quick and easy, there is a healthy volume of loans (with varying risk profiles), and the management is fairly responsive "
4,"Minterest is transparent in its process. We can ask various questions in the Telegram group and minterest is very patience to answer our questions.  However, I think the dashboard of minterest needed to be improved. Some of the dashboard is not very clear"
4,"Minterest is run by experience ex-Bankers which is great and they classify the loan grades in to ABCDE similar to S&P, Fitch etc ratings! They even have an auto-bot that helps you manage your loan investment to save time and effort! However it can further improve by not lumping A-B, C-D grade together as it defeats the purpose of having such good finer grading! One has the ability to choose good grade companies (A-B) with lower interest returns to loan to, and avoid poorer grade (E) though with very high interest returns; while discretionarily invest in fair companies (C-D), giving the control to investors to decide!"
3,"Have been using since Q1 of 2019  Pros --- + Very detailed information about borrowers & loans + Auto invest by borrower rating (A, B, C etc.) + Sufficient & frequent communication especially for late payments, potential defaults  + Majority of loans are doing well + Large secured loans available once in a while  + Deposits are reflected within minutes   Cons --- - Auto invest minimum of $500 (although actual auto invested may be less or more). - No option to opt out for specific loans. Have to disable auto invest before money is allocated  - UI navigation is not great (e.g. From login to dashboard to wallet or investment opportunities) - Communication is via uploaded documents - Difficult to track repayments & balance of exposure by company / loan. - Loans are not frequent"
5,"Good lending platform run by experienced and people with integrity. While the software interface has some room for improvement, Minterest is always present in communications and quick to respond to member queries. Depositing funds is an easy affair, and they have also set up a face-to-face meeting to ask about areas of improvement. Many local deals and some interesting offshore deals as well. All in all, a great company run by great people in my opinion. I hope it will grow in many years to come while at the same time contribute to the community of SMEs. "
5,"I‚Äôve been on Minterest for more than a year now. Having tried many other platforms, I like Minterest the best as they are quite open about their process, and people are able to freely ask questions and discuss on their Telegram group. There is no attempt to hide or shy away from tough questions and we are always reassured that they are working to improve the system based on our feedback. Personally, I feel that the team is doing a pretty good job and will continue to recommend it to my friends still."
5,"I've recently joined Minterest as an investor but have not had the chance to invest yet due to their deals getting taken fast. Based on my experience so far, they have a really friendly UI for their website with tutorial videos explaining on how to use their features. I also really like how they regularly keep us updated on their telegram group chat which makes it more convenient for investors like us. Overall, it‚Äôs definitely a good platform for new investors who are looking to get into P2P lending. Let‚Äôs hope I‚Äôll be fast enough to get more deals in the future!"
5,"I've just signed up as an investor recently but have yet to invest as the deals are always taken up too fast. The thing that I like most about Minterest is that they have a Telegram group where they give constant updates to investors, for e.g. whenever there‚Äôs a new deal launch and investors could also ask queries in the group chat."
5,"I've just came onboard Minterest as an investor recently in April and I have invested in 3 or 4 loan deals so far. I would say it is a good platform for alternative investments for university students that has spare cash and some liquidity. They have a very detailed loan deal fact sheet which I find it very useful for investors. I learnt that the Minterest Team spends a lot of effort in their due dilligence and assessment before launching a loan deal. I haven't had any deals that has defaulted yet. Furthermore, they have a telegram group that disseminates the information about the loans. After  investing in Minterest, I would say it gives a pretty decent return despite the risk involved. Will recommend people looking for alternative investments!"
5,"Started my first p2p lending on Minterest and so far so good. Invested more than 20 deals, at least once/twice a month and really loved how detailed they are in analysing every deals, e.g financial analysis of the company, SWOT, cash flow analysis etc. Probably one of the best out there if you want to know what exactly are you investing in. Easy to use web mobile friendly interface but would be better if there is an app. Looking forward to more investment and new options! "
4,"I've been an investor for slightly over 4 months now and has tried to participate in their deals (but mostly failed due to the speed that the deals are taken up). However, I'm comforted by the fact that so many investors trust the due diligence done by the Minterest team which is not surprising from their years of experience.   Something that I like about Minterest a lot is that they have a telegram group in which they keep constant updates to their investors and answers queries quickly. They also inform us through email and the telegram group when there's a launch happening so we can keep a lookout for them.  However, at times new deals are fairly slow in launching so it might get a little frustrating and the onboarding process is a little confusing at times. But overall, I think it's a good P2P platform to place your money!"
5,"Firstly, as an investor, i am deeply comforted by the fact that the Minterest team is run by 3 very experienced ex bankers. Due diligence is very in depth for instance, i am surprised by the details and analysis provided in the loan request fact sheet, It gives me the necessary information to assess the borrower. The other platforms that i have used are not as detailed.  Secondly, Minterest has a telegram group created for investors, to address all their queries. They are also very efficient in their replies. This always gives me comfort as an investor on their platform.   Lastly, interest rates are very fair and there are no hidden costs. Since the team is made up of ex bankers, interest rates (risk & return policy) are reasonable and well calculated based on each borrower. As an investor, based on the previous deals on Minterest, i am already confident and comfortable with the interest rates given to me.  Trust me, i have used many platforms and Minterest is the best. Cheers!"
5,"Really good if you‚Äôre intending to spend on major big ticket items and intend to split by installment. It helps if you have an existing OCBC saving account as well, as it makes bill payments very seamless. "
5,"Hidden gem that splits your payments into monthly instalments interest free. To top it off, you can earn up to 1% rebate on your purchase. Useful for your big ticket items."
4,Few cards in the market that auto convert spending into interest free instalment. On top of it still entitled to 0.5% or 1% cash rebate. 
5,"This card is good if you are aiming for big ticket purchase. Beside split to 0% installments, there are also 1% cash back "
5,I love the feature of it that allows me to split my insurance premiums into monthly Instalments. Would definitely recommend to my friends.
3,"Pretty attractive dining and entertainment offers, but only if you visit these places. Overall, decent but not the best cashback program. "
3,Interesting card face that rewards for ‚Äúyoungsters‚Äù kind of spending. To take note of the minimum spend else the Cashback percentage is relatively Low 
5,Easy to use for the rebate on weekend. Definitely a must for dining and entertainment. Young people favourite. Will definitely recommend to friends. 
4,"Good card to fill the areas for dining, grab and entertainment as it offers more than ocbc 365 (which i was previously using). But note that 12% cash back is only for these categories, and any other categories would be best purchased with another card. If you eat out often and use grab frequently (even topping up of grab wallet), this would be a card for you.  They have a recent 12% rebate promotion for 3 months, but check the terms and conditions for the min spend of $600. Best to call up UOB once you receive the card and reset your statement month to the calendar month, this way it will make it easier to hit the bonus qualifying period for the 12%. "
3,"Only use when i dine with friends or watch the movies together, will try to use more next time , now paying minimum payment of $100 for $3000 spent till next paycheck."
3,"For those who often love catching movies, eating out, partying, online shopping and travelling or frequently travel on Grab, this cards gives you rebates 3% - 8% per transaction, which is great because you get 1-for-1 deals and more. Perfect for the outgoing person since you get to save a little even though you need to spend! "
1,Your online services are terrible . Literally 3rd world standards. Some idiot is running the bank. That is definitely not me  . Application for cards are so terrible . Yet your sales pple chase us up the escalators .
5,"My husband and I use this bank account (separate bank accounts) to pay for our wedding. We put all our money inside and apply for the UOB One card. This account only works with spending on their ONE card. Every month, we will call our hotel coordinator and have them charge $2000.00 to it. The rest of the 4 purchases we will spend on random 7-11, NTUC items. We got back close to 3k of cashback from paying our wedding. Really very worth it for people who needs to pay huge sums. "
1,"I would like to share my experience with UOB one multiplier.  The criteria of credit salary is misleading. I credited my salary into the UOB One account but was not entitled the interest under the ""Credit Salary"" category. End up I only get 1.5% for spending above $500 on credit card.  This is the reply from UOB when I enquired about it.  ""In order to qualify for the salary credit (purpose code: SALA), your employer will need to use bulk payroll service (if your employer is banking with UOB).  Single GIRO/FAST or manual standing instruction transaction does not qualify as salary credit.   If your employer is holding other bank, please get your employer to check directly with the respective bank.""  For outsider like me, how am I suppose to know about it? Even the branch officer that I visit told me that I just need to credit my salary.    "
5,"Perfect if you have at least 60k-75k lounging around, easiest hurdles to meet, just 2 criteria, $500 credit card spending and 3 GIRO bill payments, for a 2.43% yield. I started out with OCBC 360, then created UOB One after maxing out the 60k limit, just transferred 50k to UOB One at one go, then re-accumulate in another hurdle account (I use the salary credit, bill payment which pay to the same folks I GIRO to, another $500 credit card spending), whichever else that suits you best."
1,"I have been trying to apply for the UOB one card for about 3 weeks. I was first told to apply through internet banking account. That got rejected because i had to upload all my documents. Your staff called and i was busy at that time. So i requested that they sent me an email and they refused to. So i told them i will apply through the website without logging in so that i can upload all the needed forms. I tried to do that when i got home and did that, after applying, they said it could not be processed because there is a pending application. Called back. was told to wait a day before they can abort the application. IT TOOK ONE WHOLE WEEK JUST TO ABORT IT. When it was finally aborted. I reapplied and patiently uploaded all by documents... 4 days later i get a notification, saying i need to upload EVERYTHING AGAIN.... "
4,Best current account with high interest! Their user friendly internet banking interface makes site easy to navigate and easy to use.
4,Pros (agreed with Silvester) -ATM convenient. Can use OCBC/UOB. Almost always no queue -UOB one card complements UOB one account. ($50 very quarter if spend $500/month consecutively) -No need to credit salary if can pay 3 bills by giro  -mobile app with nice user interface. Can use fingerprint scan -UOB also lets you monitor your bank transactions in the past 3 months  Cons -I miss OCBC's website friendly interface with money insights and virtual savings accounts to have financial goals -CC spending is on a quarterly basis. Does not care if you make a big purchase in one month then eat grass the next. I wish they averaged it out across months instead.
4,One of the competitive interest rate of saving account which also apply for foreigner.                    
4,"I feel the uob banker can improve their customer services, my colleagues applied for plans but the one account is not open after 6 months of the plan signed."
4,One of the competitive salary crediting account that earns sizeable interest rate. Only caveat is to hit the minimum spent of $500 a month on debit/credit card. Must pair up with one/yolo/lady‚Äôs card.
5,Easy to earn the additional interest through the simple criteria of a min $500 credit card spending and salary crediting or 3 GIRO debit transactions. Provides a high interest of 3.88% if all criteria are met.
4,Service is good .  Patience staff . Helpful and explaining all details well . Staff helps to do some documents as fast as they can. 
5,Best one account easy to get extra interest and also link to the one card that gave the cash rebate. Will recommend it to more family and friend 
5,Best high interest account in the market! Reliable and efficient travel insurance claim!!!! Highly recommendable and easy to claim. Your one stop solution for all travel insurance needs!! 
5,Best cash rebate account in the market! No fuss and hussle  free! Insurance can be charged too!!!!!! 
5,"The uob One Account offers seamless interest with no compulsory salary crediting into account. Meaning if you have spare cash but only 1 salary, you can open either dbs multiplier or OCBC 360 Account as salary account and Uob One Account as an account to earn high interest without salary!"
5,UOB was easy to sign up and also offers good rates for me. I have been using UOB for 6 months and the service online and also at the store has been good. Thank you!
5,Very high interest of saving account which earn up to 3.88%  Will advise to change your money to this Uob one account 
3,"Hassle free card, not much of an issue for me. Especially with UOB One card, good for usage, rebates and service is alright. "
1,I also applied one uob account via online  2 weeks ago and totally no news at all. So slow n disappointed with their services.  Initially thought that it should be fast via online  than paper application. :(
4,"UOB, knowned for its professional services and details. Always a joy opening an account with them. All the mailers and instructions thereafter was prompt and no further instructions were needed for me to issue my first ever cheque to my Sister!   UOB - Right by you :)"
4,"The interest rate has been updated.  Great if you want to park your additional short term fund of 75k for an effective interest rate of 2.44% per annum, provided if you fulfill 2 requirements.  Maintain $500 recurring expenses on UOB One card (can earn $200 rebates per year) AND have 3 GIRO transactions.   In this way, salary crediting can be performed on another account (OCBC/DBS/BOC/Maybank) to earn the salary credit interest."
4,"Good interest and prompt crediting but you must have $50,000 to reap full benefits. Anyway, easy to meet criteria (two out of three) and good product overall."
4,This is still my preferred choice of interest programme as it is most relevant to my personal circumstances.
4,The rebates is pretty generous but need to make sure that you meet the criteria for 3 months. It is even better when you have UOB ONE savings account as spending above $500 on UOB credit cards give you additional cash rebates.
5,"Good place to put your money if you have 50k (anything more, you can put it in ocbc 360 and credit your salary in for 1.2%).  Their two criteria are easy to achieve: min spend $500 (or if you are using their credit card most also require a $600 min spend to get rebates so you will definitely hit it), and 3 giros/salary.   Take note that their drop down list of giro billing organisations are VERY limited from their online personal banking page. It is mainly IRAS tax or HDB loans, and their UOB credit card. For any other billing organisations like Singtel, other bank's credit card, SP services, you have to set it up yourself manually by downloading the forms from respective organisations and sending it over. The process for setting up GIRO manually also takes around 1-2 months, so take this into account when you open a UOB one.   You can also pair UOB one account with their Yolo card and a sweeps account - they call it their young professionals solution account. Might be worth considerations if you dine out and use grab often for rebates with Yolo. "
3,"Yays  1. 2.43% effective interest if you have exactly 50k (because the interest rate is tiered)   2. No need for salary credit if you pay 3 bills by giro instead - love this   3. Very convenient atms  Nays  1. Tiered interest rates mean that the account doesn't favor the poor  2. Mandatory spend of $500! Again, doesn't favor the poor  3. Will comment on the UOB ONE Card because it is intrinsically tied to the account. The card only awards quarterly rebates upon consistent expenditure of 500/1000/2000 for three months. Being so consistent is tough if you only have a one-time large expense. And the cash rebate is also capped at the respective tiers. In other words, spending in between these tiers will not yield you any extra rebate. "
5,"This is one of the best current accounts out there with high interest (assuming you have $50K and spend at least $500/mth on your credit card bills).  This may seem difficult to achieve at the start, however if you were to combine all your spend on ONE card, you will figure out that $500 is easily achievable.  Insurance, installments, fuel, groceries, bills, dining, etc.  To really maximize the 3.33% interest, you will need at least $50K but even at 2.22% on the next $20K, this interest rate is still better than most Fixed Deposits.    You also get a cheque book which is great for new couples moving into the next phase of their lives where they may be spending substantially on high cost items like furniture, renovations, car, etc.  Great rebates on fuel from the major players (Shell, Esso).    Best savings account to have."
5,I am using this account for $50K balance + no need to credit salary + 3 giro will do. Straightforward hurdle account.
5,"I simply need to do 2 things to earn the 3.33% interest (effectively is 2.43%) for first $50,000:  1. Credit my salary 2. Spend at least $500/mth, including giro payments eg. insurance  This is pretty easy compared to other banks. And on top of that UOB One Card will have $50 rebate per quarter (effectively 3.33% cashback)."
5,"Pros - highest interest rates compared to OCBC/DBS - no credit salary requirements - able to earn $50 rebates quarterly with use of UOB ONE card (good for recurring expenses) Cons - cap at 50k, would be better if it can be raised to 70k"
5,"Reason: To earn bonus interest, one of the requirements is (credit salary via GIRO reflected as ‚ÄúSALA‚Äù, or pay 3 bills monthly via GIRO). It's the 'or' operator that matters as I have the option of changing job, if I have to, to one that does not have the reflected ""SALA"" for salary crediting. I already have been paying 3 bills monthly via GIRO."
4,"Pros -ATM convenient. Can use OCBC/UOB. Almost always no queue -UOB one card complements UOB one account. ($50 very quarter if spend $500/month consecutively) -No need to credit salary if can pay 3 bills by giro  -mobile app with nice user interface. Convenient and easy to login for transfer and checking of details  Cons -need to track credit card spending to hit $500 to earn the interest rates. -Tiered interest rates. Effective interest rate of 2.43% instead of 3.33%.  My advice is to call and change the credit card cycle to the start of every month to complement the UOB one account so that you don‚Äôt miss the interest rates or the UOB one card rebate. (A simple call will do the trick)  Overall, still a relatively good account if it suits your spending habit ! "
3,"UOB One's 3.33% seems impressive but it's been more of a well-marketed campaign than anything.  You need to hit a lot of targets e.g. $500 monthly spending while keep $50,000 consistently in the account.  The credit card spending is also tricky since the amount is not counted on the day you spend, but when the transaction is processed...so spend early in the month!  The 3.33% is also not fully earned on $50k, but in stages of $10k and $20k respectively. Overall a bit difficult to manage and process can be tiresome e.g. GIRO arrangements, checking credit card bills, etc. Would recommend product to a HNWI (High Net Worth Individual) with regular and high spending patterns. "
4,Great card for online spending (and nothing else). One star deducted because points are not always rewarded when they should be and you might end up on the losing end if not fully conversant with the Tncs / not tracking your points awarded! 
4,Great credit card for online spending. You could get up to 10x DBS points for it however at a cap of 2k per month. The only con is that you have to spend at least 2k per month to enjoy the wonderful benefits of it.
5,"Only bother with the World Mastercard edition, 4mpd for almost all online spend <= $2000 monthly.  Die die must have."
5,"Great online spending card with 10x DBS points for the world mastercard, and both male and female can apply. This is and still is my go-to card for any online local and overseas spending. No minimum spending, but there's a max spending cap of SGD 2k per month, after which you only earn 1x DBS point which makes it pointless to use beyond SGD 2k. However the 1yr expiry of DBS points is a pain point, and that's the main reason I'm easing off usage of this card and moving towards Citi Rewards Visa and Mastercard which has 5yrs expiry and has more partner airlines. Nevertheless DBS Woman's World Card is still a useful card to have and I would highly recommend everyone to get this card to complement a few other cards to maximize your miles earning potential."
5,Strongly recommend this gold card for online spending for 4mpd. Only negative is DBS points will expire in one year and there is a fee to convert them to either krisflyer/Asia miles 
5,"There are 2 types of DBS Woman's Card - Blue & Gold. Go for the Gold! I have heard that the 80k per annum requirement is not strictly enforced, and guys can apply too! My review will be based on DBS Woman's Card Gold.  What I love is, the card is great for both Miles & Cashback. Spending is rewarded with DBS Points, which can be later redeemed for either Miles or Rewards on the DBS Lifestyle app.   This card gives you the most rewards for the first $2000 spent online: 10X DBS Points for every S$5 spent online. $2000 online spending translates to 4000 DBS points, which you can either redeem 8000 miles (4 miles per dollar) or ~5.8 x $10 = $58 NTUC vouchers (2.9% cashback). Only $5 minimum spend is required to unlock rewards (do note that DBS points are rewarded for every $5 spent).  Drawback is that spending above $2000 will only award 0.4mpd, and DBS points earned from this card must be redeemed within 1 year.  I'll strongly recommend this card to online shoppers, for their first $2000 online spent. Can be combined with other cards for either a miles/cashback strategy."
5,"Firstly, there are two variants of the ""Woman's Card"". DBS Woman's Card (Blue) and DBS Woman's World Card (Gold). Their reward system are different, so do check before applying.  I personally feel the DBS WC (Blue) is like the evil sister compared to the DBS WWC (Gold), so my review is for the latter.  Pros: 10x/4mpd for online spending. (Grab, Fave, and pretty much everything online) Useful to combo it with DBS Multiplier credit card spend for more % DBS Points pool  Cons: 10x/4mpd cap at $2k per calendar month, anything more that $2k will award 1x/0.4mpd Poor oversea spending point rate DBS points earned on this card will expire in 1yr  If you are into miles, this card is a must have in your team! If you can't put enough spend on this card within 1yr, you might want to checkout DBS Altitude. Don't let the S$80k and above per annum entry level requirement scare you, just apply for it! (Got it with only S$30k per annum salary). And Yes, man can also apply for this card! "
5,"I had a shoulder injury and made a  claim for  the medical bills via FWD,. The process is fuss free, everything online.  Customer service was great, payment of the claim was speedy.   I renewed the policy because of the great experience I had.  I used just compare prices until I made a claim that I realized how important is the claim service. "
5,"My favourite card to use for overseas spending!! Be it while travelling or online shopping. I've saved so much just by using YouTrip and its hands down the best multi-currency wallet/app/card. No fees to apply, no minimum balance, no annual fee, no transaction fees and 150+ currencies? What more can I ask for??? "
5,"I love it!!  Found out about YouTrip after I returned from my Korea trip late last year. Was really upset about missing out on this solution then. Since then, I've only used YouTrip for every of my overseas purchases. I can't believe how convenient it is?    Great rates, every weekday every weekend. With an awesome colour to boot. "
5,"YouTrip really helped me out while I was traveling for a few months!  Having access to so many different currencies, I never had to worry about running short of money. Not to mention it has great rates and 0% fees!  Will definitely recommend it to fellow classmates when we go for summer exchange!"
5,"YouTrip has been a game-changer for overseas payment, and it's obvious that other players are now starting to react. First and foremost, the rates are amazing. While I won't say that cash is obsolete, but it's been a while since I last had to rush to find a money changer before I travel. Now I can still get the same rates going cashless, or if really necessary, when I withdraw at an ATM abroad (FYI - ATM network & bank fees still apply).   I also love the fact that YouTrip is pretty much accepted worldwide. I had a friend that went to Kenya, and much to his surprise, it works! That's really important especially in places where SGD cash may be hard to exchange, so you end up spending insane with your credit cards.   But most importantly, I love how they just understand travellers so well. They have a really spunky touch to things, which gets me excited to get involved with them. Overall, a 5/5 and I would highly recommend to my friends and family! üëç"
5,"A must-have multicurrency-card when you are travelling, all you need is a YouTrip card and your mobile phone and you are good to go! Good FX rates at NO FEES! Also, IT'S FREE TO SIGN UP!"
5,Favourite mode of payment anywhere I travel to! Very convenient and easy to use app interface and definitely offers the best rates (I‚Äôve compared it against many other bank cards etc). Highly recommend it- there are really no downsides
5,"Love the fact that I've completely skipped the money changers for all of my last 5 overseas trips this year. The exchange rates are mostly comparable to getting cash at The Arcade and sometimes even better.   And in some places like BKK where you really need cash, the ATM withdrawal only charges $5 for any amount, but the only thing is that you'll need to do some homework to know which foreign ATM doesn't charge extra fees. Definitely still beats taking the time to find a money changer or using cash advance to withdraw with credit cards! "
5,"Super useful application when you travel to other cities, especially further ones and you don‚Äôt want to over-exchange or risk getting robbed. The rates are super good, close to those you find at typical money changers! Highly recommend!"
5,"As a cabin crew & frequent flyer, this card really helped me to save time to change money before I go for flights. Initially I have to keep my currencies in small zip-lock bags & tag them,but now with YouTrip, I have them all in one app.  Even recommending it to my family & friends who don't travel that often, but on a monthly malaysia/jb trip, we save time & skip the money changing part.   Keep up the good work YouTrip! From a very satisfied user. "
5,"I‚Äôve always held back from reviewing because I hadn‚Äôt had the experience of using my YouTrip card overseas. Now that I have, I can safely say that getting one was the best decision I‚Äôve EVER made. Hands down. Period.   The exchange rates are comparable to the ones provided by Google search, which helps me to save a considerable amount of money since I (among the nation of vacationers hahaha) am spending a lot on my holiday.  The app too is user-friendly and easy to get the hang of. So few things these days give me the peace of mind, and YouTrip is certainly one of them. An absolute class of a modern service."
5,"YouTrip seems to have the best currency exchange rates among all multi-currency products and the 150+ currency offering is extremely convenient for travellers like myself.  Sign up process and card activation was quick and seamless. Transactions have been really smooth over the last 9 months of usage. My recent trips to Malaysia have been cashless thanks to YouTrip. Not only did I save money with its great exchange rates, I also saved a lot of time not queueing at the money changer."
5,Youtrip is the best multi currency card in the market. I have used it so many times for my travel.  I‚Äôm really Glad that there is such a good card introduced into the market. Thank you Youtrip!
5,Saved lots of money with this card. A must have card when traveling overseas. Will definitely recommend this card to family and friends. 
5,So far the Youtrip experience for me has been great! Very convenient and the rates is always better!
5,"I'm a frequent user of YouTrip! It's really helpful when I use the card at Petrol kiosk in JB, without having the hassle to exchange money at exchangers.   Kudos YouTrip!"
5,"YouTrip is jointly developed with EZ-Link, Singapore's first contactless stored value card introduced for public transit use in 2002. "
5,The best conversion rate compared to ALL money changers I have ever seen. It is definitely worth having one especially for those who often travels overseas.
5,"Application for the card is simple and quick. After receiving the physical card, I proceeded to setting up the youtrip app on my phone. It was a breeze and I am able to get exchange rate information whenever I want. The rates have proven to be very competitive and the physical card can be used as Ezlink too! I had recommended this to my family and friends. "
5,"Youtrip is an immensely useful app as you can enjoy spending overseas without worrying about the lack of cash available for the remaining days of the trip! What‚Äôs amazing is that the exchange rates offered by Youtrip is the best in the market, helping users like me and you to save a few dollars ‚ò∫Ô∏è The card can be used locally in Singapore as well so do not worry if you‚Äôre not travelling anytime soon!! Tried and tested the app in so many countries so thank you Youtrip for the wonderful invention :-)"
5,YouTrip is a good app to use when oversea. Can easily convert the currency at good rate. Can also use as debit card in local store and restaurants.üëç
5,YouTrip is super convenient and useful for me when I travel around South East Asia. It covers so many countries and I'm extremely happy with it. No more coming back home with loose change!
5,A very convenient way to spend and keep track of your purchases wherever you are. The fact that you are able to lock your card via phone is a good way to do so. YouTrip has been great and will keep using it for future trips. Cheers!
5,One of the best cards out there to help me save on overseas spending. Definitely a must-have for it‚Äôs good exchange rates. üëç
5,"I have used this extensively during my 5 months stay in Japan and honestly feel that it is more competitive and convenient to use than my OCBC and DBS cards.  The relatively low withdrawal charge of S$5 at ATMs compared to that of OCBC and DBS definitely made it much more worth using when withdrawing. Moreover, the exchange rate they operate at is a lot more competitive as well, a definite win for consumers.  To top it off, it has a debiting function in JPY which I could use seamlessly at major stores that accept credit cards using my virtual JPY wallet instead of having to use cash.  In the end, I brought 4 different cards from OCBC, DBS, and YouTrip, but only used my YouTrip card during my whole stay there. If you're travelling to Japan it's definitely more than enough for most purchases unless you need to pay something that goes above S$2,000."
5, A good option for overseas transaction. Youtrip provides one of the best currency conversion rate for diff currencies with no transaction fee!  Helped me save quite abit on my overseas trips. 
5,"I was in London and my SG sim card couldn't receive SMS to login to my YouTrip account for top-ups! And while I panicked for a bit, I was so impressed by the ingenuity of YouTrip to allow the 2nd option of email OTP! It's small details like this that caters to travellers' needs that makes this the card of my choice! Not forgetting how competitive the rates are as well! "
5,"This is certainly a magical card since these enables users to pay in more than 150 currencies without currency conversion or transaction fees and no fees no markups at highly competitive wholesale exchange rates. The most i like of this card is, it a safer choice for travel in case of lost or stolen card incidents :)"
5,"On a very recent trip to Melbourne, hardly need to use cash at all. So convenient just to tap the card without worrying about the change & heavy coins.  Accepted everywhere, even on the airport bus. Can easily topup & exchange more immediately on the phone app & exchange rate v favourable.  My trips from now on will be using Youtrip card for payment.  When my friends saw me paying with the card so easily, they want to get the card too. So Glad I found Youtrip üòä"
5,"LIFESAVER! We were devastated no money changers would exchange SGD to Icelandic Kronas. Luckily we purchased our Northern Lights tour using YouTrip, when conversion better than 'Google rates'. When the tour was cancelled they again refunded in foreign currency - YouTrip saved us from crazy fees, TWICE! No more struggle between the hassle of finding money changers/carrying cash VS paying the exorbitant bank transaction fees - all my trips will be with YouTrip!"
5,Very convenient card. Exchange is good compared to other credit or debit cards. Great card to have overseas.
5,"Used it as debit card during my Paris trip on July. The rate is very competitive even compare with money changer.  And of course, sometime youtrip FB will throw in some contest including leave a review which is good for us too.  This review content is genuine and based on experience although I leave this review just to win the contest. "
5,"The experience so far is great. Conversion hassle free, just that the transaction will take days to weeks to go through successfully"
5,"we are able to transact at a good exchange rate when overseas! top up was almost instantly reflected in the account, and best thing was I can avoid receiving lots of heavy coins during last minute shopping at airport when returning!"
5,Introduced by a friend and was wondering how it earns. nevertheless tried it and it was amazing with good exchange rates that is even better than the exchanger! Have been using the card for overseas shopping and online purchases ever since
5,"Used it for first time during my Europe multi-country trip two weeks ago. This is extremely handy as it allows instant top up and exchange to the foreign currency, as well as notification on payment made. It saves me a lot hassle to find money changer and risk in carrying along too much cash. Only feedback is only when I paid double in Paris and requested refund from YouTrip, I was told to fill up a form for chargeback which will cost me a $5 processing fee if the outcome is not successful, and it may take 2 to 6 months for resolution. "
5,"One and half month into my exchange programme in Germany and as I travel around Europe. With the exception of one Uber trip in which the value could not be deducted, YouTrip never fails. Making purchases overseas have never been so easy. What I love the most about the card is the Smartexchange Function in which the app would automatically change the cash of another currency wallet in your card (calculated with the best rate) to make up for the lack of amount in that currency‚Äôs wallet. It helps me a lot as my euro would always run Low and the card would then compensate by using SGD, saves me a lot of trouble!"
3,"Good for buying stuff overseas and online stores based outside SG. However, once top up, cannot withdraw, so most use cases will revolve around confirming a purchase then top up to prevent locking in cash.  No special credit card benefits like cashback, miles or other rewards system. Also, topping up this card will not yield any rewards unlike the UOB+Grab combo.   Overall, biggest plus is the forex rates."
5,Used it for recent trips. Very handy as you will have access to almost any currencies in any countries. Caveat is the $5 fee which I find on the high side. 
5,Is a creativity card that enable you to country around the world and best part you can withdrawn money from other country with a small fee
5,"Got the card a month ago - received it within 4 days of signing up. So far so good. The currency exchange rates are really quite promising compared to local money changers' rates. I think what is really helpful (for frequent travellers) is that you can store currencies in the account. The only drawback is that you cannot withdraw money out of the account, but what I do is then use it for bus and train fares."
5,Awesome YouTrip Card!!!! Easy To Use!!! Best Rate Ever!!! Best Thing To Use While Shopping At Oversea!!! Love It ‚úåÔ∏è
5,"I highly recommend this card as the exchange rates are good and it works exactly like any credit card, except this does not come with any hidden fees. I have also introduced many of my friends to sign up and have also received plenty of good reviews from them. I get notification whenever any transaction is made and I also would know the rates immediately. Topping up is also such a breeze.  Awesome card! Great job Youtrip!"
5,I tried using Youtrip card oversea and it works perfectly. Hassle free and most important is the exchange rates are reasonable. Thanks.
5,Great app to travel without changing money. There were a few hiccups where the card couldn't function properly but no biggie
5,I've been using youtrip for my overseas trips for the past 4 months. I must say it's really convenient and easy. Love the ease of topping up and exchanging currency via the app. Rates are really good too! I use it for online purchases like Amazon and iherb (usd charges). So much better than going through my local bank credit cards. üòâ
5,YpuTrip has one of the best if not the best exchange rate for currencies conversion. I can check out the rate any time any way on my phone conveniently. Running of cash overseas is no longer bothersome with YouTrip. Head to supported overseas ATM and just withdraw cash easily with my YouTrip card. Nice!
5,Best exchange rate I've had on any multi-currency card I've used so far. It's even better than the rated at the money changer especially for niche currencies like Czech Koruna and Hungarian Forint the last time I visited Europe! 
5,Very convenient and safe. Is always my no.1 card for overseas shopping. You just need to link to your debit card to youtrip account and you can start using. Is very easy to use 
1,"I applied more than one month ago for my trip last week and the app just says ""we are processing your request"", didn't get the card in time for the trip and no idea how to activate it...   UPDATE: 2 months after I signed up for the Youtrip card, I finally got a text saying that my card will arrive in 7 - 14 days. -.-"
4,I travel a lot for work and I‚Äôm enjoying the convenience of Youtrip so far.  I can make online transactions and contactless payments with this card and it saves me a lot of time and money! Downside is transactions like trips via MRT are usually lumped together and deducted at one go and it‚Äôs hard to keep track of how many transactions were deducted and how much money is left in the card.  
5,Good exchange rate when I used it in my trip to Japan last weekend. Better than the rates I got when I changed money at Chinatown the day before the trip.
5,Mad love this card!  1. Super convenient top-up 2. Competitive rates  3. No-need to hassle with spare change from overseas travels 4. Pretty packaging ;)
4,"Registering for the card:  - 1-2 weeks. Due to its high demand now, it has taken a longer time for me to get it vs. some others who may take a few days. - KYC process was quick, just the IC details and a snapshot of it   Suitable for:  - Multi-currency online purchases - Transacting G10 currencies. Not too sure about other currencies as the exchange rate will only be displayed after you make the transaction - Purchases under SGD6000, since that‚Äôs the daily spend limit   Fees:  - No transfer fees  - SGD10 card replacement fee  - SGD5 atm withdrawal fee, deducted from your YouTrip card  - SGD5 per month if your YouTrip account is dormant for 12 months from last transaction. don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll be reminded once it hits 9 months from last transaction  The currency conversions, amount deposits, card activation-all works on the app and later paid with Youtrip card. I used it when I was travelling in Malaysia and London which was great & easy to use. Even better that I get credits after referring friends!"
4,"I met the YouTrip team once, and I'm surprised it was an actual mastercard and it took around 1 week for it to be activated. It was pretty straightforward, the typical KYC stuff, take photo of IC front and back etc. After that you get a SMS which says that you are activated.  After that, the card can be used. I only used it locally so far (at any merchant which accepts Mastercard) which is a lot of them in Singapore, comes with a very nice app which shows you all the various currencies in the market which you can hold (up to 10 currencies).  Will update again when I go overseas sometime in Feb 2019 (in Japan) :) Will definitely use this card while travelling, functions like a debit card. Only thing is that when you wanna withdraw money overseas it is $5 withdrawal fee in SGD.  Worth a shot and One of the real big competitors to the DBS MCA!"
5,"Easy to top-up with a swipe and no random OTP of sort so you can easily top-up overseas as well (sometimes OTP from SMS or email doesn't work when you're overseas).  Compared to other multicurrency cards, YouTrip provide real-time exchange for 150+ currency, meaning you don't have to exchange in advance and they will convert the currency for you at the point of purchase whenever you spend. Making it truly global and hassle free!  Though I do hope that we can use the card to withdraw from ATM without fees like TransferWise and Revolut. Currently YouTrip is charged at SGD5/withdrawal from the ATM. "
5,"excellent rates,fuss free usage,no regrets.....its now my go to card for foreign transaction...app is easy and straight forward "
5,"Excellent rates, convenient and fuss free. Would definitely recommend to everyone traveling overseas! "
5,"An excellent card to use when going shopping online - unbeatable rates! Also like the ease of topping up the card via the app, and that I can use any excess on bus or MRT rides."
5,"Being the first multi-currency card that is launched in Singapore, YouTrip has revolutionised the market to allow customers to top up to YouTrip via Visa/Mastercard. The MCC Code for topping up to YouTrip is different as compared to Revolut, which allows them to earn rebates from some credit card.   For a couple of my trip this year, I have been using YouTrip fully. It is kinda scary to bring zero cash overseas as I will have to fully rely on my YouTrip card (and the country will have to be relatively cashless). My trip experience is as below:   (1) For my 15 days to New Zealand, I am glad that YouTrip is really user-friendly as it allows me to use in almost all the places within New Zealand (except for the farmers market at Christchurch which some vendor only accept cash). I have a couple of refund (for example hotel deposit, car rental refund etc.) which have to be done within the app, and honestly, it is pretty fuss free. The only small concern during the trip was that the transactions may not show up pretty clearly due to the UI/UX error but I have been able to contact YouTrip staff which was able to generate the report for me to view line by line.   (2) For my 5 days trip to Laos, I have used YouTrip to withdrawl in Laos ATM machine. Note that in Singapore, there is no money changer for Laos. So the only way to change money is to change to USD -> then to Laotian. This resulted in 2 transaction cost. The other way to get cash (as Laos generally do not accept credit card) was to withdrawl via YouTrip. The transaction is capped at 1.5million LAK, at a rate of SGD$5 (Youtrip rate) + 20k LAK ($4). So, we have to do a couple of withdrawl at the ATM for everyone to use.   Overall, with YouTrip in the market, it really have change how I spend my money overseas and travel in general. Really happy about it :)   "
5,"When I‚Äôm in Hong Kong and running out of cash, just pop by any ATM and I can get my local currency cash without hassle. But beware, Bank Of China ATM have a limit of HKD$2,000 per withdrawal while other Bank‚Äôs ATM have a limit of HKD$3,000 per withdrawal."
3,Once money is in cannot cash out. So you will have to spend it somewhere. Not about to transfer around thru friends like grab. Do not see the real benefit of it!
5,"Saw it on the papers,Easy to Apply and activate, Great card to use in Singapore and Aboard ,no additional charges even if unused now.Now i can use mastercard too!"
5,I tried using Youtrip card at malaysia and korea and it works perfect fine with the transaction. Easy and the exchange rates are reasonable. Thanks Youtrip.
5,"Have used YouTrip card on my Bangkok trip and it is so convenient. It is just like a credit card but with benefits, there is no bank fee and i can see the amount in sg dollars within the day with the pending word to let me know of the status. Love using it as it helps save on the exchange rates and more for me to spend. "
5,"Great card that‚Äôs perfect when you‚Äôre shopping online on overseas websites, saves you a ton! Also a lifesaver when you‚Äôre paranoid about carrying too much cash overseas but you don‚Äôt want to deal with transaction fees"
4,Youtrip is rly great! Great exchange rates and perfect for students on exchange. Convenient and hassle free too.
5,"It is very convenient, especially when I travelled around Europe which requires different currencies and I don't have to carry them with me/ change with the money changer. the transaction fees are also very affordable which is another reason why I prefer youtrip to the traditional method!"
5,"Applied for YouTrip and it has been my best travel companion so far! Not only can i now pay convrniently overseas with no fees, i also get better value for my dollar! This means that i can shop overseas without worries and bringing too much cash with me! "
5,Had been using for most of my overseas trip and local purchases.  Very safe and convenient and you don‚Äôt have to worry about credit cars fault found in most debit card or credit card issued by banks.  Even my children I encouraged them to apply. Now everyone in my family had their own youtrip card. 
5,"YouTrip is the first card that I used overseas. It is convenient, trustable, easy to use and has good exchange rates. Would definitely recommend people to get this card. Application is free too!"
5,"Except for the occasional hiccups in system maintenance delays, everything works as it is! YouTrip definitely helped me plenty while I was in Europe and it has the best rates ever! "
5,"YouTrip is my one and only card, Whether it is online shopping or country hopping.. I am assured of forex savings with every transaction... it‚Äôs such a joy having you in my wallet."
5,"My best travelling companion, anytime, anywhere! Better rates than any moneychangers around. From Singapore to JB, to Iceland. "
5,"I had my first experience of Youtrip in Malaysia, the rate I had was much better than the money changer. First impression counts and I had a great first impression of Youtrip."
5,YouTrip's in app 24/7 money changer supporting over 150+ currencies is my favourite feature. Just slot my YouTrip Prepaid Mastercard into my wallet and I am ready to go. No longer do I need to make special trip to physical money changers during operating hours for currency exchange. I can also lock down favourite exchange rate for 10 currencies and store them in YouTrip travel wallet for future use. The bonus is that YouTrip now charges ZERO dormancy fees. Yeah!!!  YouTrip not only has me covered with its Prepaid Mastercard but also provide cash withdrawal feature at overseas ATMs. The best of the best is that YouTrip uses wholesale exchange rates for currency conversion. This is definitely my  essential travel item to bring along for overseas trips.
4,"YouTrip is a user friendly app. It helps me to exchange the currency on the go while I am traveling. The exchange rate is good! For the outstanding balance in the card, I use it as normal debit card transaction when back in Sg. It‚Äôs hassle free!!  High recommended app to travellers ! "
4,"Smartexchange feature that youtrip has, is one of the best if not the best. Top up in a single click away and easily spend in 150+ over currencies while youtrip take care of it for you. However, there's a overseas withdrawal charge from both the local bank and youtrip. (take note of it). "
4,Very easy and convenient to use. Love the app but would be even more awesome if i can download my monthly spending via pdf of something like a bank's monthly estatement.   As Singaporeans we travel to Malaysia often. Would be great if we can pre convert our SGD to MYR. 
4,"Definitely a great app, interesting concept of combining so many uses into a card and an app. The tracking of the expenses is not very accurate just yet and there are some minor bugs still around. Great app overall!"
4,"A great card, the exchange rate is very competitive. Topping up & using the card is easy. Downside, I'm not sure if this happens to me only but there are some situation that you aren't able to use the card. For example, topping of fuel with self service kiosk and some online purchases. Hence would recommend that you have an alternative card as a back up, as you don't want to be caught in a situation where you can't pay using the youtrip card."
3,Only using this card for travelling. Very handy to use as it has almost every currency. And you can easily change SGD to any currency in less than 5mins 
1,I never received my cards after 3months of time wasted trying to contacting customer service who was completely useless. I decided to cancle my application as I would not trust this kind of company to handle my money and I would recommend anyone reading this to think twice as well. There are many alternatives to this product that may not have been as well marketed. 
1,"Customer service is TERRIBLE. I can‚Äôt emphasise enough. The amount of frustration built and accumulated just dealing with the customer service surpasses whatever pros the card has to offer. Painfully slow replies, inefficiency in dealing with issues, and insincere interactions. I got so frustrated and gave up using this. Requested for account closure and refund (still had almost 200‚Ç¨ in the card), but it has been 3 weeks now and nothing is being done yet, even after I sent in one more email to ask about it. Horrifying. "
3,"Highly recommend this card for frequent travellers. However, processing time takes exteremely long. "
3,"Wanted to use YouTrip during my last visit to BKK, only to realise that my account was locked. I tried resetting my pin but was unable to do so. Contacted the YouTrip team, but they didn't resolve the problem until a day later. By then I had already left back for Singapore. I've used YouTrip in the past without issue."
3,"I selected 3 stars because it's obviously not my first choice to use it again.  Pros: Easy sign-up process; I didn't have to wait long for card to arrive and activation is easy. Also, rates vs banks & money exchange is good! I am actually using the card more and more until...  Cons:  I noticed that transactions isn't just appearing later; they are NOT appearing in the app at all. I went Malaysia, made a few big purchases and noticed the amount was charged but did not appear in the transaction at all. Now, if I need to use the card I need to consciously check it every time after usage to make sure I'm not being charged wrongly and that the transaction actually appears. Also, I've sent in request for more than a month to send me the breakdown statement and nobody has gotten back.  Verdict: Would I use it again? Yes, because of the excellent exchange rates, convenience (mastercard, paywave applicable and don't have to hassle myself by topping up or activating the card at MRT stations) + the fact that it is a security feature to be able to deactivate the card simply by opening the app with fingerprint and click the button. Also, in case of theft; it's limited to what you have top up and not the entire bank a/c.  But nah... I have to monitor my every transaction like a hawk is like nono... they need to fix it. Fast."
3,"Well, this card is alright. nothing much i can complain about. serve as a decent credit card for casual spending monthly.  1 thing to note is that the annual fee is $230 and the fee waiver process takes at least 2 working week before you get any notification.  "
4,"Have been using this card for the past 6 months plus. Hands down this was one of my favourite cards which I selected after doing an assessment here: https://blog.seedly.sg/best-cashback-cards-for-working-adults-in-2017/  Pros: - One of the highest for dining (10%) but capped at $30 per billing cycle - Same for online and supermarket purchases which stands at 5% - Additional interest for your savings account if you are on the BOC SmartSaver account  - Ideal for larger family sizes where this can be your main utility cards  Cons: - They changed the min spend from $500 to $700 last month (April 2018) which kinda sucks :(  - Beyond that, some of the caps include categories like dining and online at $30 each a month - This is the main reason why I am giving it only 4 stars and not 5 stars  - Cashback was delayed for 2 months before and the UI on the app kinda is not good LOL  - But the customer service called me up to check on the status etc which is not bad  Overall, I may be switching to a miles card depending on our progress as a couple. And if my spending drops below $700 per month. But we'll see, in the meantime, it's nice to get good cashback monthly :) "
4,"Been using this card for the past 8 months plus and in the past their other services. BOC is still NKOTB, so kinda in the past not really good in their offers until recent 1 to 2 years. Still my main card due to :  Pros: - One of the highest for dining + Movie at 10% but capped at $30 per billing cycle - Telco/supermarket/hospital bill /netflashpay[first 4 auto top up with fees at $0.50 each auto top up]/best denki, Bigbox, Toys r us , Unity, Watson, all shared at 5% BUT Cap at $40! (So max spend is $800) -  Online spend at 5% but cap at $30 (max spend $600) - Good to consolidate all your household charges/ spending to get the max cash back out of it!   Cons: - They changed the min spend from $500 to $700, effective 24th April 2018! TOO MUCH! - Need to call up CSO to find out your billing period and it is based on book-keeping date (posting date), and different CSO actually gave me different date! Furious!  - With everyone posting date different, and transaction may post 2 to 3 days after transaction date(depends on merchant), you need to buffer:   (a)  2 day before the starting of the posting date and    (b)  3 days before end of posting date => to ensure your transaction safely fall into the cash back period for yourself   eg. If your posting date is: 17th Mar to 16th Apr, you need to spend on 15th Mar to 13th Apr to ensure it safely falls into your billing period to fulfill the $700 min spend and then ensure each cash back category doesn't get over the max cashback cap of each category.   -  Probably they realize they are paying too much cash back due to many pro user using their card! haha.. so they started consolidating spending category and limit the cash back. sigh...  - Worst Internet banking and apps ever, confusing bill, troublesome to login, LONGEST 2FA code in the world!!! Very hard to calculate the cash back transactions validity.   Overall, still the only good cashback cash in the market than the rest with easier spending to meet. "
3,"A new review after one year. The refused to waive the annual fee fully even though my spend is prolly above 10k per year. The still charged a total of $50 for one main and one supp card. That said, I'm still going to use it because the rebates are pretty good so far for rebates. I might stop once I change to a full points/miles system."
3,Good for dining and Super marketing spending with a high cash back of 10%. Only draw back is the cash back cap and high minimum spending of $700.
5,"This is the cash back card i will recommend to others.  ATU NETS FlashPay for up to 4 times per month earns you 5%. So every $50 top up earns you $2.5 but only pay 50 cents service fee. You can use this on public transportation, make payments where credit card is not accepted, only NETS (like People Park Complex). The usual Ezlink Top Up doesn't earn you anything.   Besides, telco bill, hospital bill also earn 5% which is not very common to other credit card.   You can also use this card to pay income tax/property tax, insurance premium, seasoned parking, condo maintenance fee etc via CardUp earns you 5% cash back. There is no other credit card that can offer the same (as far as i know lar). However, you need to pay 2.6% service fee to CardUp. This transaction will be categorised under online transaction which cap at $600 spent per month.   Grocery shopping at 5% is just normal cashback you can get from most credit card.  Therefore, if you consolidate these expenses into one card, it is easy to achieve $700 min spent per month. The cashback is cap at $100.  "
4,"One of my fave cards I would say because the cash back is simple to achieve as long as you meet the monthly minimum spending ($500 when I first got the card months ago, now they revised to $700 per month since end Apr but it‚Äôs very doable for me cos I charge nearly everything to this card).  Although they increased the minimum spending, BOC also upped some Cashback %, like dining is now 10% Cashback compared to 7%? (I think) before.  Easy to use because there‚Äôs no other hoops to jump (eg. Some other cards required minimum 8 transactions of $30 at least plus $500 total per month to get cash back) BOC family card is simple. Just hit the minimum $700 and next month you will get the cash back which is directly credited to your bill and deducted from payment. Easy! 5% off on supermarkets. Everyone needs that! I would have given it a 5 star rating except that the internet banking isn‚Äôt so user friendly and some websites or retailers machines don‚Äôt accept BOC cards.  I‚Äôve faced some problems making payment in some outlets but not a major problem.  The BOC call center staff are fantastic. Would recommend this card! "
5,"Rating it cheekily. This is the best ""dating"" card.  Guys will be relieved to know with the BOC card, there is a smaller hole burnt in their pockets with the 10% rebate for local dining and movie tickets. Of course, there is a cap of $30 per billing cycle (approx $30 expenses); so guys don't indulge your girlfriends too much with the BOC card :P  As for families, there is a 5% rebate for grocery shopping and teleco bills. While the overall rebate cap for expenditures is $100 per month, this is acceptable given that financially prudent individuals are unlikely to spend a large expenditure.  Best card out there at the moment, putting our local banks' credit cards to shame! "
5,"Signed up with Tuas Power today after comparing between Keppel Electric, Geneco, Ohm, iSwitch and Tuas Power. Here's my 9 reasons why I signed up with them after extensive research online and finding out more at their roadshows: 1) Integrated billing means no need to receive two bills, or set up new/additional payment arrangement 2) Billing transparency means having a piece of mind. Have requested to see billing sample from the above retailers. Only Tuas Power shows the usage in figures (i.e. XXX kWh); exactly as what is shown in your SP bill now. Keppel one shows a bar chart with no indication of the exact kWh which leaves room for billing manipulation (although you can log into your SP utilities portal, if you have one, to see the figures). No wonder so many people reviewed about their billing in-transparency. 3) Competitive sign-up incentive. Tuas offers Bonus Link Points, $ùüØùü¨ ùó°ùóßùó®ùóñ ùòÉùóºùòÇùó∞ùóµùó≤ùóø (sign up at roadshow or online) Tuas, Keppel, oHm and Geneco have a 1% rebate with POSB everyday card and/or 5% UOB One Card rebate + 1% off with UOB. For roadshow, Keppel offers a total of $50 off bill if payment by UOB, $20 off bill if by other cards. 4) Earn 1 NTUC Link Point for every 8kWh 5) No additional security deposit which some retailers charge. 6) TFL is absorbed. Of the retailers above, only Keppel does not. 7) No relocation fee. Geneco charges a $10.70 fee if you shift house. 8) They have been in business for a long time and own their own power generator, unlike other smaller independent retailers. 9) Roadshow promoters not pushy or touting. To be honest, I went down to the roadshow wanting to sign up with Geneco as many people gave good reviews and the prices shown online by banks are one of the lowest. However, I realised at the roadshow that prices are the same/almost the same across the different retailers for the 2 year fixed package. Keppel had the best sign up incentive especially for UOB card holders and direct rebate to the electricity bill. I finally went ahead with Tuas Power given the plus points mentioned above (esp. billing transparency), positive reviews about its customer service, no-fuss online sign up process, and pretty competitive incentive."
5,Signed up during their roadshow. Ambassadors were very friendly and informative! They could answer most of the questions that other retailers were not able to. I find that having the same SP Bill is super convenient as well because I am too lazy to pay 2 bills and change my payment method. Customer service is reliable! Will recommend others to choose Tuas Power! 
5,"Life is not always about the cheapest price as cheap service usually hangs together with it. Tuas Power goes against this by offering very competitive prices and best of all, excellent customer service. I have called a number of times and the call gets answered straight away by very friendly lady who sort out problems on the spot. Keep it up."
5,"Benefits while signing with Tuas Power:  1. The ONLY gentailer to offer integrated billing with SP. Billing arrangement remains the same as per with SP. (my MAIN reason to sign up with TP)  *i still able to use SP APP to view my bills, charts and statistics!  2. No additional security deposit needed for existing SP customers.  3. savings of $100 bill rebate to be earned for PowerFix36 or $60 rebate for any other 18 or 24 month plan via online signup! There is an added referral $20 bonus for you if the referral code is used!   *after you sign up, you will have your own unique referral code, you may start to share with your friends and family! Both referrer and referee will each get additional $20 bill rebate.  4. Prompt customer service here on FB to assist you with your queries on the plans and signups.  5. Ease of mind in signing up with one of the leading power generation companies in Singapore.  6. Get 1% cashback using POSB Everyday card  7. Free 12 months insurance protection from Aviva for new electricity plan signups  8. Accumulated Linkpoints for every 8kwh of electricity charged all at the same time!   "
5,"Spending few days google and reading hundreds of feedbacks fr various retailers and comparing between the most popular few retailers such as iSwitch, Pacific Light, Geneco and Tuas Power. I decided to sign up with Tuas Power due to the following reasons :- * Integrated billing with our PUB bill like what u see in yr SP bill * No additional Security Deposit is required for existing SP customers * Get 1 NTUC Linkpoint for every 8 kwh used. If u are not a NTUC Plus member yet, sign up at ""https://plus.com.sg/rs/tps"" for your complimentary membership & earn up to 150 LinkPoints for free ! * MSN to Tuas Power facebook for any doubts, they will response u promptly  * Free 12 Months AVIVA Insurance (choose either Home, Personal or Travel) * 1% cash rebates on yr monthly electricity bills through POSB Everyday Card. https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/cards/credit-cards/posb-everyday-card * Most importantly, when u move house before end of contract, just inform Tuas Power and u will NOT considered as terminate yr contract !  Take a look at the workout that i have done and why i made above decision for choosing a 3yrs FIXED RATE plan. As Govt SP simply too costly but it allows us to choose other retailer. FYI, Govt SP currently is $0.2442/kwh ($0.2592 with 7% GST or $0.2662 when adjusted to 9% GST).  * if opt for i-switch at 3yrs Fixed Rate of $0.1767/kwh (inclusive of 7% GST). However, there is a $5.30 Monthly Service Charge besides yr electric usage ! 500kwh wd be $88.35 + $5.35 = $93.70.  * if opt for Tuas Power, fixed at $0.1798 (inclusive of 7% GST), yr monthly bill is $89.90 when u switch to TP via on-line sign-up in July Promotion. U will get $100 rebatem + $20 if u get my referral code.  Conclusion : Monthly 500kwh electricity consumption for 4 - 5 rooms Rooms:- * if remains SP wd be $129.60 with 7% GST or $133.10 when adjusted to 9% GST). * i-switch wd be $93.70 * Tuas Power wd be $89.90 yet for on-line sign up wil further get a $100 rebate + $20 when keying in my referral code.

5,"I choose Tuas Power cos they are established and they give me the same SP bill.  They promised nothing will change except I choose my rate.  They are not the lowest price but after the staff shared with me on comparing those additional charges by the other companies, it seems to work out the same.  So their rate is quite competitive.  "
5,"There‚Äôs so many electricity retailers, we are really spoiled for choice.  My criteria was to find a plan which is simple not complicated with lots of charges which I‚Äôll get confused with.    We noticed some had monthly admin charges and even charging paper bill as part of saving the earth... more like saving their operating cost.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the earth but I really need my paper bill too.    So I figured out that since Tuas Power kept saying they same SP bill, so having one bill with everything else maybe still cut the number of paper bills for utilities... still save the earth,  plus based on ST report the past tariff seems to be going upwards. The staff mentioned most customer is taking up PowerFix 36, to pay that rate $0.1798 longer.  It made sense.  So I took that rate even though it‚Äôs not the cheapest.  With those extra charges added the lower rates comes up to the same.  So yes! We finally settled for Tuas Power!     "
5,"After reviewing all power supply companies, , optional for Tuas n Singtel power , finally submitted to Tuas power ,all because their customer service are very helpful to reply by email with very detail explanations, wish to Thanks Jasper Woo for the great help customer service."
5,"I signed up in end June and is now eagerly awaiting the switch in mid July. When i signed up, i spelt the name with one alphabet wrongly. When i received the confirmation letter with Tuas Power and spotted my error, it was passed working hours. Thus, i emailed and left a FB message for them.They assisted me to correct the error on the next working day. Wht i choose Tuas? 1. An experienced well known gentailer in singapore and not merely a retailer. They hv their own power plant. Stability factor ensured. 2. Integrated billimg with sp removes the hassles and ensure easy tracking.  Current payment mode and cycle remains. Familiar bill together with other utilities like water and gas. 3. No extra deposits or weird charges. Current deposit already with sp and will continue so. 4. Easy usage for any future govt utilities renate or u save. 5. Locked in cheap rate for 3 mths at $17.98(with GST). Cheaper than current sp and electri tariffs and inflation, which are usually on an uptrend. 6. $120 rebate for my fixed plan.  Get on board the power train!"
5,"Thank you tuasPower help me to save. I used to think no need to change la. Later ah gong give rebate, I cannot get. So all retailers come to promote to me. I see them look like see ghost üëª. And I cross my hand ‚ùå to them. Until one day, my Son explain to me, why the need to choose open market retailer because I have been paying more than 40years + of this expansive bill. After I swap to TuasPower with the plan of powerfix36, I can no worry about the price up as I‚Äôm safe now with the lower rate. With the promotion and I referral my Son. I got $140 rebate, thank you Tuas Power for your amazing promotion."
5,The whole process of the switch done online was smooth and fast. The response was prompt when I sent an inquiry thru its FB. The only disappointment was the promo free insurance which I opted travel insurance coverage for a year is too basic. It does not cover hospitalization & surgical  which is essential.  Not what I expected. 
5,"Notes on how I came to my Decision, hope it helps everyone: 1. Chose amongst retailers which were integrated with SP for less fuss (Ohm, Tuas Power. Didn't consider Best as reviews were fewer). 2. After looking at the discount and fixed plans, went with FIXED since I thought tariffs would likely go up. 3. Performed 10min fuss-free application at Tuas Power 4. Chose the 24-month standard plan, the 18/36mth were ""non-standard"", where there was a statement that the retailer may change prices DURING the contract. Wanted some certainty so went with the standard."
5,"1.Self Service Portal 2.Pay, manage and track you bills and activities online 3.Mobile Tracking 4.Same SP Bill. 5.Earn Linkpoint 6.Free Aviva insurance for 1year. 7.Enrol to T+ remembers for more in house promo     "
5,"After poring through all the reviews, articles online on open electricity market, calling up the hotline of the retailer, I finally decided on Tuas Power.  Took up the fixed price 17.98/kwH (after GST) Non-standard plan for 3 years, getting a $120 bill rebates.   For those who are worried about extra charges under a non standard price plan, this review is just  for you. I called and verified with the customer hotline staff the charges that may apply:  1. Early termination charges of $200. 2. Admin fee of $53.50 if the account holder fails to provide the retailer the mandatory supporting documents. 3. One time fee to install the smart meter (OPTIONAL) 4. Security deposit if you are not existing SP customer. 5.  1% interest per month on the unpaid outstanding balance.  What the above means is that if u are a diligent customer in paying bills, stay with Tuas during the time period you sign, there will be NO additional charges. For those who are confused with the charges in the fact sheet for a non standard pricing plan (18/36 month), I have done the due diligence by calling the customer hotline and basically the difference lies in the pricing plan and potentially charges AFTER the expiry of the non-standard pricing plans so please MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TUAS POWER LETTER BEFORE THE EXPIRY TO SELECT IF YOU WANT TO OPT OUT OR STAY WITH THEM, in which case, if you do not do so, the contract will AUTORENEW.  Some other people have highlighted the perks above which you can read from above but what I find the best about Tuas Power are:  1. Same SP bill ( not electronic but physical); good for elderly people who are already familiar with it  2. For people who are renting house, you will be happy to know that in case you take a 18/24/36 months pricing plan and you move house within the time period, Tuas Power will not charge you for moving to a new residential address and you can use up the remaining months of the existing pricing plan without RECONTRACTING.   3. Fuss Free online application. You just need to send your existing SP bill and the copy of your NRIC/FIN via whatsapp after signing up.     Hope the above review was useful."
5,"Perks of signing up to Tuas Power:  1. The 36-months fixed plan contract entitles us to a one-time $100 bill rebate, and on top of that using a referral code gives you an additional one-time $20 off. That works out to be a whooping $120 in total! 2. $17.98 cents/kwh (GST included) 3. Billing transparency (usage in figures) 4. Integrated billing under the same SP utilities bill 5. No additional security deposit needed for existing SP customers 6. 1 Linkpoint awarded for every 8kwh of electricity used 7. Tuas Power owns their own power plant 8. No relocation fee should you move places (shift house) 9. Transmission Loss Factor fee absorbed  With the above, I did up a rough calculation of the amount of savings over the 36 months as compared to SP services, and these are the figures:  (Based on 300kwh for our consumption)  Year 1 savings: $23.82 x 12 months = $285.84 + $120 (one-time rebate) = $405.84  Year 2 savings: $23.82 x 12 months = $285.84  Year 3 savings: $23.82 x 12 months = $285.84  Total savings over 36 months: $405.84 + $285.84 + $285.84 = $977.52  That‚Äôs a lot of money saved! "
4,"Signed up in a roadshow in the estate in May.I think Tuas Power attraction to me is same for many people.Rebates, linkpoints and most importantly same bill.As for the rate ,almost all companies in the open markets offer similar competitive rates but Tuas is better off with the above plus plus.So I signed up for a two year plan without further consideration and also persuaded some of my friends."
5,"I am from #teamtuas!  First of all, tuas power has very competitive rates and rebates and they have plans stretching up to 36 months which is perfect for people who fear that the electricity cost will rise and wanting to lock down the rates.  It is also hassle free with an integrated bill with Sp at no cost.  And in case you are worried about its reliability, tuas power is one of singapore leading power generator since it being incorporated in 1995 with best practices in energy efficiency.  Since switching, i have saved at least 20% of the electricity cost every month and not to mention the upfront rebates and recurring posb /linkpoints rewards!!  Customer service wise, you can message them on facebook and they will reply you promptly within a day! All these points made tuas power a preferred choice holistically after comparing to the other oem."
5,Great customer service help me to switch from ohm to tuas when i said it had to be done within 1 week. Great referral code ideas.
5,"Hope this helps and end up your misery on thinking which OEM to choose. Don‚Äôt fall with the lowest price offered. Same as the rest, I have done my shot on researching and reading reviews from other ppl. Finally, I have decided to switch to Tuas Power. Reason why I chose TP:  1. No hidden charges. No additional carbon tax and transmission loss fee. All inclusive 17.98$  2. Share same billing with SP Services. Don‚Äôt need to track 2 bills.  3. No security deposit required if you are under SPS.  4. Fuss free online application and can WhatsApp the needed documents üòâ  5. Tuas Power offers almost same package with OHM except that for TP u will earn NTUC linkpoints for every 8Kwh  6. Plus plus plus 1% rebate on bill if you are paying with POSB Everyday MasterCard.   Take note this is no joke. We have accumulated big $$$$$$ so far. üëèüëèüëè  I don‚Äôt see any point of staying with SP coz they charge us 23.85c/KWh (exclude GST). Our household uses average 900kwH/mo. This is clearly 50$ off our expenses in a month üí°üí°üí°"
5,"Hi all, I've called Tuas Power Customer Service to clarify. During the current promotion of $60 rebates (2 years) or $100 rebates (3 years), if you put in the referral code, you'll get additional $20 rebate on top of the $60/100 bill rebates i.e $80 (2yrs) /$120 (3yrs). But still, they have this referral scheme that earns you extra $20 for every person who uses your referral code to sign up.  ** For those who're lucky to sign the Powerfix36 [3 years- 17.98 cents/kWh (w/GST)], so the recent rise in electricity tariffs does not affect us.  Therefore my suggestion is to sign up first and then you'll be given your personal referral code. Then you can ask friends to signup or advertise online so that others can sign up using your referral code.  After some weeks later, just call the Tuas Power customer service and check with them whether anyone signup using your referral code, you'll be surprised you may get a few signups and more rebates!   Furthermore, there is a free Aviva 12-months insurance and you get to sign up a complimentary Plus! membership worth $10. "
5,"Enjoy $80/$120 bill rebate without having to change your payment mode, along with the convenience of having the same SP bill.   Visit www.savewithtuas.com/our-electricity-plans/ for more info!  Sign up was fuss free and took me less than 10mins. Requires only NRIC and your most recent SP bill. I signed up for the 24 months 22% DOT plan to lock in the discount for 2 years."
5,"Here are some info for 18 & 36 months non-standard plan.  This non-standard plan will not have additional admin charges, optional charges like physical bill, requiring you to sign up with a bank for recurring payment etc.  There is no varying charges once you have signed up for a plan.  The rates will be locked-in based on the duration you have selected.    Meaning once you have signed up for a 36 months PowerFix, you will be paying $0.1798/ kWh (with GST) for the entire contract duration of 36 months.  There will not be any increase or decrease in electricity price.   Got this info from their customer service regarding non-std plan  This promotion gives a $120 bill rebate, with no campaign code required."
5,"After studying all the power providers, I decided to get from Tuas Power - the main reasons being: - They are one of our own local suppliers with a good track record since 1995 - They have a special partnership with SP so it is just a simple transfer with no other hidden charges, and billing comes together with the SP bill - you can keep your existing payment arrangements (e.g. Giro, credit card, etc) - I have already linked my POSB Everyday card previously - so I can continue to earn the 1% rebate every month - I'm also an NTUC member so getting the extra 1 LinkPoint/8kWh looks quite good - for my average use of about 650 kWh/month, that works out to about 81 LinkPoints a month - If you need to shift home, you can give 1 month notice and your contract can be transfered to your new home without any fuss.  Just for those who are a little bit more into data-driven decision making, you can search and download the electricity tariffs for Singapore over the past 5 years and do some calculations to see if you should choose the fixed or discounted plan. Based on some simple calculations I found that the mean over 5 years was $23.62, with max. $27.53 (Apr 2014), and min. $18.92 (Apr 2015). Apr 2019 is at $24.39. Now if you take 22% discount across 5 years, the mean will be $18.42. So my own conclusion is that over time is still makes sense to take a fixed rate at $17.98 (inc. GST) - may be good to take a short-to-medium term plan in case the price drops over time due to stiffer competition. Please don't hold me responsible for any of these - I urge you to do your own calculations and come to your own conclusions to see what suites your circumstances best. I'm just sharing my own thought process ;)"
5,"Signed up with Tuas Power today after comparing between Keppel Electric, Geneco, Ohm, iSwitch and Tuas Power. Good and reliable!  Strongly recommend. Competitive rates for 2 years!!!!!! "
4,Just signed up fixed rate to lock in rate for 3 years. Integrated bill with SP Group so foresee no more problems using U-save unlike what I personally experienced with Sembcorp Power. 
5,"Among the retailers, I prefer a more established company or one with generation plant as it seemed to be more stable thus it is one of the few in my consideration.   Chosen Tuas Power after comparing with Geneco and Sembcorp as the company offers integrated billing with SP which is convenient to settle just one bill with water & gas and yet enjoying a lower electricity rate.  Earning linkpoints monthly is also a value added benefit besides the one month free electricity offered months back. The 36 mths fixed rate is truly a good choice seeing that SP tariff is going up.   Customer service is prompt too and willing to clarify the doubts we have."
5,"Hope this helps and end up your misery on thinking which OEM to choose. Don‚Äôt fall with the lowest price offered.

Not the lowest in the market but definitely no funny nonsense from them."
5,"Very easy switch and my electricity is working just fine. My entire month's bill is also cheaper too!  Not only that, there's Ntuc link points to be earned every month. Would recommend it to anyone that's thinking of switching their electricity supplier.  The roadshow staff from Tuas are friendly and helpful as well :) "
5,Sign up was smooth and fast! Receive $20 bill rebate here when you sign up RCC3A7A !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
5,"I switch to Tuas power a couple of months I have notice that compare to prev with SP, it‚Äôs save on my every mth. As compare to last year billing. Tuas power is good. Trust Tuas power. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª "
5,"My household in Zone 2 was the 3rd batch for the OEM and launched in January this year. Being cautious, I took time to attend roadshows to hear out the packages of some retailers (Geneco, iSwitch, Keppel Electric, Senoko & Tuas Power), comparing rates/plans and reading reviews of earlier applicants. Two months ago, I signed up with Tuas Power for PowerFix36 with the objective to get maximum savings based on my household electricity consumption.   Would like to share my pre-signup considerations and my experiences during signup and now a customer. 1. Reputable company, has been generating electricity since 1999. 2. Prompt response to my emails and very informative live chats when seeking clarifications before online sign up & as a customer. To me, good customer service is very important, especially post- acquisition. 3. Price comparison - Tariff at 17.98 cts per kWh (incl GST) is competitive with other retailers but much better than SP 25.92 cts (incl GST).  4. Promo rebate in May/June - Attractive $120 bill rebate for PowerFIX36 (now $100) to offset future bills, hence savings. 5. Free 1 year AVIVA insurance - choose either home protection, personal accident or travel insurance. 6. Easy online sign up with uploading documents.  7. No additional security deposit required. 8. Correspondence - Email updating on action in progress ie working with SP on the change of retailer, etc and confirming activation date. 9. Activation within 2 weeks of sign up. No action required of me. 10. Integrated bill - No change in billing, one SP bill. Just received bill which stated clearly ""Electricity Services by TP"" and ""Water Servics by PUB'"" and the respective kWh & CuM usage. Happy to see smaller billed amount for electricity. 11. 1% cashback using POSB Everyday credit card for auto-bill payment 12. 1 NTUC Linkpoint for every 8 kWh use. 13. Referral code - Used my sister's referral code. Each of us (ie referrer & referee) will get $20 rebate reflected in our bills. I also received my personalized referral code and can start to earn rebates when my friends use my referral code. üëç  So far, I have not encountered anything negative and am happy to have made the switch of retailer.   Certainly I do worry that the regulated tariff may over time be much much better than the current lock-in 36 months PowerFix36 as there is a $200 early termination charge before the contract ends.  Recently it was announced that the next quarter regulated tariff will increase. If this trend continues, then my worry may not be necessary.  Hope these info will be helpful to those who are still pondering to switch or not to switch and the retailer to select. üòÉüíñ"

5,"I was in a dilemma deciding on which electricity retailer after doing my detailed research. Maybe it will be great for me to share with you guys my reasons for choosing Tuas Power fixed rate plan over the other retailers to avoid you getting into a dilemma as well, even though some retailers do give much more rebates.   Reasons for choosing Tuas Power: 1. Fuss free, easy online application. Can even send the documents through WhatsApp. 2. No hidden charges. No additional carbon tax and transmission loss fee. All inclusive 17.98 cents/kWh.  3. Share same billing with SP Services, much clearer bill. No confusion.  4. No security deposit required if you are under SP.  5. Earn NTUC linkpoints for every 8kWh used. 6. Get additional 1% rebate on bill if you are paying with POSB Everyday MasterCard.  7. Great customer service and helped answer my queries patiently.   With so many benefits and rebates ($80 rebate when I signed up during the promotion period, 2 Superfundae tickets, additional $20 rebate later on when I referred using my promo code), I immediately decided on Tuas Power then. Hope this helps you in making your decision.  "
5,Helped my mom switch to Tuas as she did not want the hassle of dealing with one more bill. SP billing is really convenient and she doesn't have to set up another GIRO payment. Switchover was hassle-free and she could enjoy cheaper electricity within a few weeks. I have also switched over to Tuas myself. It's okay that Tuas is not the cheapest as the difference between retailers amount to not even $2 per month. Just pick one and switch. I pick Tuas.
5,"Hi,   I just signed up for 24 months Tuas Power PowerFix plan.   The bill rebate will be credited into your SP bill within 2 months, depending on your SP Bill‚Äôs billing cycle. The bill rebate is inclusive of GST and can be used to offset all items in the SP Bill. Balance of the rebate will be brought forward to the following month' deduction or until it is completely utilized  dated: 8 Jul 2019"
5,"Signed up with Tuas Power FIXED Plan for 36 months.  Key reason was that FIXED rates are significantly lower than the historical tariff rates, with the tariffs moving upwards. If you notice, most 36 month plans across all retailers have a slightly higher rate vs the short term plans which indicates that the tariffs are likely to rise in future when the industry consolidates.   I signed up with TUAS POWER as it provided $120 rebate for a 36 month plan ($80 for 24 months), which is significant savings! Despite a 0.02 cents higher KWH rate vs competition, this only amounts to 40 cents savings per month based on my monthly usage. $120 rebate is much more worth it. Plus, receive fee waiver for NTUC LinkPoints membership & earn 1 link point for every 8kwh used & 1 year of free Aviva insurance. Visit: www.savewithtuas.com   Need more reasons? Tuas also gives the convenience of having a consolidated SP Services bill as per current! No extra effort to set up another Giro transaction & NO hidden admin/deposit costs/transmission loss factor.  Hope this helps! Thank you!"

5,Hassle free switch and bill won‚Äôt be separated with my gas n water bills. The rebate of $120 very practical.
4,"Given that electricity tariffs are set to rise in Q3 2019, I was like ""mai tu liao..."" Need to get out of procrastination mode and switch electricity retailer now.  Decision-making process: 1) Among the more well-known electricity retailers, only Ohm and Tuas Power have integrated billing with SP, which is a key priority for me. Therefore, I considered to sign up with either of them at the start. 2) After examining the factsheets, both were relatively straightforward without any other fees/charges and bundled product/services that could become problematic in the long-run. 3) After looking though online reviews, it seems only Tuas Power shows the usage in figures, i.e. billing transparency. This is also a key consideration for me because I want raw data to track my monthly electricity usage, not just any ambiguous bar chart.  Therefore, at this point, it seems Tuas Power was the better choice for me. The question now was to choose the fixed-rate plan or discount-off-tariff plan? I did a month-by-month analysis (since Oct 2017) of my household's electricity consumption and compared the monthly savings I would achieve with both plans. It appears that on the average, I would save more with the discount-off-tariff plan. Eventually, I signed up for their PowerDO 24 plan. Note that this is a standard price plan, which I thought contains less uncertainty than non-standard price plans offered by Tuas Power. To me, 24 months is also an acceptable period to lock in the discount because I anticipate that the discounts offered in the market may be lower after the current promo period.  Other pros: - Online sign-up was relatively easy - just need to scan and upload NRIC and latest SP bill. - Got $80 bill rebate (to my surprise). - Can earn NTUC link points."
5,"I appreciate if you could use my referral code if my review has been helpful to you.   You get $80 (2yr ctrt) or $120 (3yr ctrt) bill rebate* if you use a referral code during signup. Otherwise you will only be entitled to a rebate of $60 (2yr ctrt) or $100 (3yr ctrt).   Signup with Tuas Power today and enjoy greater savings with no changes to your current billing cycle and arrangements, except cheaper rates! You will still be billed the same way, receive the same paper bill from SP services!  My transfer from SP services to Tuas Power has been straightforward and fuss-free. I was given the exact date of transfer upon signup, no need to guess and wonder when the transfer would be!   For Tuas Power‚Äôs integrated billing (same-bill), you won‚Äôt have to make separate arrangements for your existing GIRO payments, everything remains the same, except you get to enjoy cheaper rates now!   You won‚Äôt have to worry about forgetting to check your email for the latest bill, wondering when the bill will be emailed to you and having to pay 2 separate bills. I had absolutely no problems getting through to Tuas Power‚Äôs hotline as well and their CSO is helpful and friendly. No need to worry that nobody will pick your call or having to resort to posting on social media to get their attention cos I can only imagine how frustrating that could be.   Also your *U-Save voucher will be used to offset your whole bill since it is under same billing, whereas for separate billing, your U-Save voucher will only be used to offset your water & gas bill with SP Services, and your credit amount will keep snowballing.   There are no changes to my consumption since Tuas Power receives the meter readings from SP services (same bill), nothing has changed. My meter reading and consumption is stated clearly on the page 2 of the SP bill.   The SP tariffs went up 5.4% for 3rd quarter of 2019, highest ever in 5 years! Do yourself a favour and switch today! Start saving! "

5,I read the reviews of all the different companies and decided on Tuas Power. Simplicity and easy to sign up. Easy upload of documents too. I signed up for the 24 mths package. 
5,"You will need to consider these when signing up. Disclaimer: This is pertaining to fixed plans and not Discount Over Tariffs plans. And this is not a sponsored post. It is just based on my own research. Hopefully it can shade some light for others.   Pro: 1. Cost $0.1798c/KWh (*as of 12 May 2019) This is not the cheapest, but the difference is at $0.002/KWh. How significant this difference will be depends on the amount of your electricity usage.  2. Billing arrangement It is one of the 3 providers that has billing arrangement with SP Group. So you don't have to worry about having a charge on paper bill, a separate paper bill that may cost money, or having just an electronic bill. This is your preference.   3. Insurance You can choose to get Aviva insurance cover for either Home Contents, Personal Accident OR Travel insurance. Just 1.   4. Credit Card Cash Rebate If you charge your monthly electricity bill with POSB Everyday Card, you can get 1% cash rebate. BUT, what I've seen so far is that the maximum rebate you will get from here is $1.  5. Rebate At roadshows, the salesperson might offer a slightly different discount. For online application, you can either get $80 (for fixed plan over 18/24 months) or $120 (for fixed plan over 36 months).   Con: 1. Rebate  The BIG clarification here is that $80/$120 will be the maximum rebate you will ever get. No additional rebate from referral from a friend + signing online rebate will be given. These discounts/rebates are not stackable. So take note if you are huge on getting more rebates.   These are the factors I've considered. Ultimately, I feel the most important is the cost and rebate, which will give you a better idea of which you would want to sign up for. And this is the only company that has a 18-month fixed plan. "
5,"By now you should be aware that most of the electric suppliers have more or less the same rate. I happened to go with Tuas Power, and the process is easy. A lot of documents can be submitted via Whatsapp, which is really a breeze. Enjoy the switch!"
5,"I just signed up with Tuas Power after reading a lot online. Reviews , comparison, tables, etc etc. I more I read the more I feel giddy... Hope I made the right choice with Tuas Power. I used one of the referral code from other user's comment too but not sure if it really works. Signing up was fast and seamless, commencement date is on 12 Jun. Reasons why I chose Tuas Power - There is a Tuas Power pamphlet came along with SP bill which make it looks more trustable, there is points for NTUC, and rebate for POSB everyday card.. and I just want to get this done and over quickly..haha. Please use my referral code too, to let me know if it really works. Enjoy!"
5,I decided to use 1 of the referral code here to sign up a 2 year fixed standard plan. Do not want to sign up 3 years as no one know what will happen down the road. So try out this 2 years contract first. Hopefully I also get extra $20 bill rebate using the referral code. Hurry! Go sign up before end of today to have the $80/$120 bill rebate.
5,"Have been using Tuas Power for the past 3 plus months and enjoyed around 20% savings on electricity as compared to the previous months before my household switched over. So far, Tuas Power has been really efficient with answering any queries I have had. Signing up is easily done online, with verification done over whatsapp. Can also confirm that the collection of the online sign up bonus vouchers are also convenient and efficient (just go down to their office located centrally in Somerset when you receive their email around 2 weeks from the date you officially switch over).  The fixed price plan is very reasonable at 17.98 cents. All this on top of the benefits of having the electricity bill integrated with the SP bill, no security deposit, 1 NTUC linkpoint for every 8KWH and bonus sign up vouchers for signing up online!"
5,"I opted for Tuas Power cos it offers   > more than $10++ savings per month since sign up in Jan 2019 > powering Singapore since 1999 [highly reliable]  > single billing with SP [hassle-free]  > Competitive pricing  > No extra service charges unlike other retailers e.g iSwitch ($5+)  > Offers NTUC linkpoints and vouchers  > $30 NTUC vouchers when sign up online  > Refer a friend online promotion üòÖ ""Refer A Friend to Tuas Power and get a $20 voucher* for each sign-up!"" If your family signs up with Tuas Power, can get $20 voucher too. But I am not sure how they are going to send out the vouchers üòÖ --> they will send you an email with PDF letter attached. The information is listed in there > offers rebate to bill!"
5,"Chose TP mainly  1. Same billing. 2. Ease of sign up 3. Lower cost compare to current SP. Others include rebates and linkpoints. Online sign up, there is fill in for either a campaign or referral code. Use referral code for additional $20 rebates!  Campaign code only have a $30 rebates."

5,$120 rebate when you sign up for a 36-month contract or $80 rebate when you sign up for 18 or 24-month contract
5,"Dear All,   Fixed Rate at 17.98 cents/kWh (with GST)!  $0.004 cents more than iSwitch for their 2/3 year plans. But, here are the key perks (from my view at least): 1) Tuas Power is regarded as one of the top 3 power providers in Singapore. 2)Incorporated in 1995 alongside the start of the reform of the power industry in Singapore.  3) Tuas Power is known as one of the country‚Äôs leading power generation companies and is a supplier of energy solutions, multi-utilities and environmental services. 4) Up to $120 off + Free 12 months Aviva Insurance (Choose from Home Contents, Personal Accident or Travel Insurance) 5) First 2,000 Plus! member receives 1,000 NTUC LinkPoints & accumulate savings each month by earning 1 LinkPoint for every 8kWh used. 6) Refer A Friend and get a $20 bill rebate. 7)  No change fee to opt out of SP and switch to a new supplier as Ohm and two other suppliers work with SP group for the same billing 8) - No security deposit"
4,"Been researching a lot on which electric retailer and finally choose this one. Benefits wise I think most of us have already shared here. For me, Paper bill is important so can discuss with my old folks of the usage from time to time. So SP direct bill would be the best option for me. Not so concern about Standard or non standard plan, since it is fixed rate and hardly feel there is any chance to change the charges within contract period (because 36 months which is even longer by double is considered as non-standard, and who will be locked for 36 months if they foresee any change in charges??), thus choose the shortest year for fixed rate in TP. Just make sure we remind ourselves on the 17th month to review again what‚Äôs the next be better option, if the rate has decreased (which I doubt so). A peace of mind for the next 1.5 years. Cheers!"
5,I signed up for PowerDO at Tuas Power because it is  - simple: having same bill with SP - able to earn NTUC LinkPoints - complimentary 12 months insurance with Aviva - $80 rebates
5,"Please feel free to use this if you decide to take up Tuas Power. Decided to choose Tuas Power because it is a most simple, clear and same bill with SP."
4,"After comparing with other suppliers, I decided to go for Tuas Power. It is the cheapest fixed rates among others. Have a good day ahead! :)"
5,Decided to try out Tuas Power after much consideration because of: -Same as SP bill -Earn 1 NTUC LinkPoint for every 8kWh used -Free 12 months Aviva Insurance -Hassle-free registration
5,"After much consideration, i decided on Tuas Power due to 1) One of the most competitive in terms of pricing 2) Tuas power has been around since 1995 vs the rest 3) The rebate of $80 or $120 is one of the better rebates, furthermore if you use any of the referral codes here, you will get extra $20 more in terms of rebates 4)Cancellation charge is more lenient vs the rest  5) Shares the same bill invoice as SP for easier accounting  Personally, i picked the 18months plan which gives the least amount of contract time yet still able to get the most rebates of $80"
5,I spent a long time researching on the different packages and finally choose Tuas Power for the following reasons:  1. Save $$$ and Huge Rebates $80-$120. 2. Same SP bills - No additional charge for the paper bill.    3. Free insurance  4. NTUC link points - monthly :) 5. Trusted provider - has been around a long time.
5,"Apply it upon completing your sign up. Signing up is easy. Took less than 10 mins. One of the lower fixed price plan if you choose to stick with the same SP bill only in lower kWh. Meaning to say, you will still receive the same SP bill monthly but in lower electricity rate. Not e-billing."
5,Just applied for Tuas Power and the swop will only commence on 12 June. Seems like they are quite popular! Liked the bill rebates of $80 (18/24 mths) and $120 (36 mths) and the additional 1 year insurance (choice of home content / travel / personal accidents).   Going to change from GIRO to paying with POSB everyday credit card too to get the addition 1% cashback.   Let's help one another save more money!!  Cheers!
5,"Sign up took me less than 10mins. It requires only your NRIC and your most recent SP bill. I signed up for the 24 months, 22% DOT plan to lock in the discount for 2 years. Visit www.savewithtuas.com for more info!"
5,"Like everyone else, I did a LOT of research. In the end, I decided on Tuas cos a. I am a kiasu Singaporean who wants things CHEAP but also confirm safe (won't close shop, etc). b. I like the openness - no additional fees. c. I like the 18month timeline. d. It's not Senoko. Keekee  Come la, join Tuas!"
5,"Decided to choose Tuas Power plan as it‚Äôs more convenient (an integrated bill, link to NTUC card, etc), high rebates and competitive pricing plan."
5,Definitely a good deal all around for a reliable and trusted provider. The $80/120 signup rebate means $3.30/$5 every bill for 2/3 years making this the lowest overall monthly rate. NTUC link points is definitely a plus üòä
5,1. Same bill as SP 2. Lower pricing than previously. 3. Can blast Aircon a bit more than last time. 4. Referral codes for even lower pricing.  Why not? Good things must share.
5,"Easy and quick online application.  -Keep you SP bill -Payment using POSB Everyday card get an additional 1% cash rebate -Sign-up rebate $80/120 -Earn up to 1000 NTUC Linkpoints -Referrers get a $20 bill rebate for each successful referral, and Referees get a $20 (Referral Bonus) + $30 (Online Sign Up Bonus) bill rebate! -12 mths free AVIVA insurance for home protection/travel/personal accident    Visit www.savewithtuas.com for more info."
5,"I've been hearing people raving about switching electricity retailers to cut their bill size. So I decided to research and found Tuas Power to be one of the 3 retailers in Sg to share the same bill as SP, bringing about convenience for my parents who might forget to pay the bill if it is electronic. Tuas Power is also one of the top few positively reviewed retailers, offering the enticing $80 off sign up (ends 30 June 2019) and relatively low fixed rates. I signed up for the 24 months fixed rate package. Be careful of signing up for non standard price plans (eg. 18 months) as the pricing structure could be subjected to changes by the retailer. Please read the fact sheet and terms and conditions before signing!"
5,"Online application link.  https://savewithtuas.com  Just sharing on my own experience.  Sign up for 24 months fixed rate (PowerFIX 24) standard price plan hence I get $80 rebate as part of the promo. The online sign up is easy and processing is fast. Signed up on 11 May. On 29 May, switched to Tuas Power. You will get mail/notification from SP Services and Tuas Power about the switch.  Reasons why I choose Tuas Power  1.	Same bill as SP Services 2.	Earn linkpoints for every 8 kWh used (since I shopped at NTUC frequently) 3.     Cashback for using POSB Everyday card 4.	No extra security deposit if your account is currently with SP Services 5.	Include the Transmission Loss Factor and Carbon Tax  The 18 months and 36 months fixed rate are non-standard price plan. After reading the footnotes, decided to go for 24 months plan instead.  I had also called the customer service to clarify. The maximum rebate for 18 and 24 months is $80, 36 months is $120. There is no additional $30 online sign-up incentive (this promo had ended months ago according to the customer service agent). You get $20 rebate for each successful referral and will be notify between 2-3 weeks time about the rebate which you earned.  If you still had clarifications, best to call them directly rather than contact them via their online contact form."
5,"Apply online to get $30 NTUC voucher U will get additional $20 NTUC voucher as compared to signing up at road shows. Website to sign up: www.savewithtuas.com When you sign up for Tuas Power, it will make you acknowledge that you are signing up for non-standard price plan. I've checked with one promoter, this is because standard price plan comes in 6, 12, 24 months etc. But Tuas power offers 18, 25 months etc. Rates will not be affected for that period when you are contracted to Tuas power. I chose powerfix18 plan with tuas power because there are only 3 companies with same bill as SP and Tuas power is one of them. Rates of all companies are almost the same and Tuas power allows me to get NTUC link points too. Carbon tax and transmission loss factor are included too. No extra security deposit if you have an account with SP Power, which most of us should have. Thank you."
5,"RCDEEA7  Use this to get DISCOUNT. 100% working  Tuas Power has been generating electricity for Singapore since 1999, and is the current market leader in the commercial industry with over 17,000 business customers."
5,"After careful and painstaking reviews of all the offerings, I tend to agree with all of you that it makes the most sense to sign up with a tried and tested provider, Tuas Power. Though not necessarily the cheapest, the added convenience of a single bill and other perks on offer, had me sold. Hope the journey ahead with a new provider is smooth sailing. Cheers!"
4,"Just signed up. Quick 10-15mins process. Can use Whatsapp of IC and Bill copy. Check the promotions page first if you want to use other available promos (e.g $60 rebate for 3 years fixed plan), instead of the referral program promo. Signed up with TP to remain having one SP bill and as it has decent fixed plan price. https://savewithtuas.com/promotions/"
5,"Agree with above points. Easy application process, no requirement for deposits and the ease of just receiving one single bill. "
5,Frds I signed up the Fixed 36 mths plan and I understand it is labelled as non-standard. The reason why it is non-standard per my conversation with Tuas Power Hotline (not roadshow reps) - The tenor is not 12 or 24 mths so other tenors are called non-standard - The auto renewal for 36 mths if you do nothing will default to the discounted tariff plan applicable at the point in time. However you can 30 days to switch to other TP plans free of charge if you so decide. Of course you can renew 18 days before contract finish and select a plan you like. - Rate is fixed for 36 mths for sure at 17.98cents so no worries on that part So pls bear in mind. 
5,"Short and sweet, benefit for you and me 1. single SP billing 2. $30 new sign up + $20 referal rebate off bill 3. no security deposit if existing SP customer 4. same payment methods arrangement with SP (no need to change) "
4,Just signed up for a 24 month package. main selling points were 1. single billing 2. $30 + $20 rebate 3. U Save rebates 
5,I just signed up with Tuas Power. Share same billing SP so just 1 bill to track for utilities and no need pay for paper billing. Also don't pay any new deposit. POSB Everyday Mastercard get 1% rebate for SP bill. 1 NTUC Link point for every 8 KWH. I chose the 18mth plan.
5,"Finally signed up with Tuas Power (TP) . 1. TP has a competitive fixed rate = 17.98. Not the lowest (Geneco and Sembcorp is lowest at 17.78) but +0.2 cents higher per KWH is not a game changer. It's about $0.80 per month if you consume 400KWH/mth. 2. TP is one of the handful of suppliers that bills via SP. So you stay with your current, normal SP paper bill. This convenience and simplicity is important to me. My life is complicated enough. Other suppliers will be a new separate bill to manage, and new GIRO/recurring payment to monitor. Also, they will charge for paper bill. 3. Since your billing stays with SP, you don't pay any new deposit. Many other suppliers will have new deposit (although the electricity portion of your SP deposit will be refunded to you via offset to your SP bill ie. gas and water). Should be neutral financial impact. But for me, it's thankfully one less thing to monitor. 4. TP has no recurring charges or admin fees, and the 17.98 includes any carbon tax, transmission loss fee etc. To be fair, many of the other suppliers are the same. 5. The sign-on rebate is $30 currently for 1Q19, and if you use a referral code, you get an additional $20. So total $50 sign-on rebate which applies equally to 18, 24 and 36 month contracts. The highest rebate I've seen so far is $60 for 36 month contract from Geneco, and $60 for 24 month from Sembcorp. I eventually took a 18 month contract from TP and with the $50, it is the highest rebate/mth. 6. I have POSB Everyday Mastercard. So continue to get 1% rebate for every SP bill. I hear other suppliers may get up to $40 one time rebate for other bank's cards. Have to see each bank's T&C. Anyway I cannot be bothered to get a new credit card. 7. Get 1 NTUC Link point for every 8 KWH. Free to get a NTUC Plus card at Plus.com.sg "
5,When you apply online you will get $30 NTUC voucher. 
5,"I chose Tuas Power Fixed 18-months 17.98cents/kWh plan. Reasons for me choosing Tuas Power are: 1) 25% saving in monthly electricity bills (Paying just 17.98cents/kWh instead SP Group rate) 2) I want a hardcopy bill and I don't want to pay a single cents extra for it 3) No security deposit needed if switching from SP Services 4) Better value for money option (i) I do not mind signing for a 24months contract. However, since Tuas Power have a 18-months contract offering the same attractive rate (17.98cents/kWh) as other majority retailers who required to lock you down for 24 months (ii) Given the shorter contract period, I will be able to jump to another retailers to enjoy ""sign up bonus"" and ""attractive market rate"" if Tuas Power failed to retain me as their customer. 5) I am a NTUC Linkpoints customer. Beside the one time 1,000 linkpoints sign up bonus, Tuas Power also provide 1 linkpoint per every 8kWh usage. I love such recurring benefit. 6) I am a POSB Everyday cardholder. This allow me to get 1% cash rebate on my monthly bill. "
5,"I actually compared quite a few and the main reason why I chose Tuas was the indirect billing since I like things integrated with my current utilities bill. They also have NTUC Linkpoints with the account. One tip is that for the FIX36, I noticed that the contract states non-standard pricing. Unlike the 24 months one. What this means is that they have the right to change the pricing along the way. So I signed up for FIX24 which was a standard contract. "
5,I have made numerous comparisons among the oem providers and found that customer service by Tuas Power and the current promotion is most attractive as of now. It is also a plus point that there is no separate billing and hence current mode of payment to SP still applies.
5,"You will get a total of $50 NTUC vouchers, additional $20 vouchers!!"
5,Best power plan for you: 1) Shortest Contract of 18 months available for the price point. (Longer contracts available 18/25/36 mths Fixed Rate. 6/24 mth for Discount Rate.) 2) Same SP meter billing. No need deposit or additional charges. 1 bill for all utilities. 3) $50 NTUC voucher (sign up online only) ($30 + $20 using Referral Code) (We both win!) 4) 1% cash rebates with POSB Everyday card 5) Earn NTUC LinkPoints. Free Plus! membership. 1 Linkpoint for every 8kWh. No reason to wait. I've already assessed this to be the best deal. 
5,"After going through all the various providers, i found that Tuas Power offers the best gifts/vouchers upon sign up. If you recommend to your friends or relatives, you get additional vouchers. In addition can get link points for a fixed kw of usage. "
5,When you apply online you will get $30 NTUC voucher 
5,t's very fast and easy. I applied in less than 15 mins. We will paying one SP Service bill while accumulating NTUC LinkPoints. 
5,"I sign up for 36 month with tuas power. Why? I believe oil is heading higher into the future, and even if that does not come about the cost of running the company will, that is a 100% sure thing and when contract end, i do not think u are going to get a rate better than it is offer now. So i think u should go for longer the contract of 36 months the better. If there is 72 months contract, i will go for that too. You will smile and thank me when you see oil at 100$ above to as high as 150$"
4,Apply online at www.savewithtuas.com to get $30 NTUC voucher Enjoy link points also when you subscribe to Tuas Power! Subscribed to Tuas PowerFix 25 months @ fixed rate of 17.98 cents/kWh. This gives a savings of approx 25% p.a.. 
5,"FYI, although the PowerFix plan is cheaper then the PowerDo plan, it is not considered a standard plan (i.e. non-standard plan) and there are some additional clauses in the footnotes. Hence I went with PowerFix18 (18 months -shortest contract, vs the 36 months) as I wanted to see what are the additional cost incurred if any."
5,best option now available now in the market 
5,"Decided to sign up Tuas power after going thru few roadshow & research online. Promoter is very knowledgeable & able to answer all my queries. Fuss free as integrated with SP bill, 1 linkpoint earn for every 8kwh, own power plant. "
5,Decided to sign up with Tuas Power after researching online - IMO it has one of the best value and has been around for awhile. 
5,"No regrets signing up with Grid! Made a mistake with my first registration but Gladys was quick to solve the issue within a day. Received my sim card a few days later and the port-in took place a couple hours later. Notice some issue with the data connection but Gladys again, handled the matter efficiently. Everything was smooth and pretty much hassle-free. Only my 2nd day using, no issue so far, will recommend!"
1,Extremely poor service and highly rigid management. Sim card delivery person left and I was told to pay additional $16 for delivery rescheduling.   Support was unable to contact delivery person to deliver to me despite I wasted time waiting at home for deliver.  The only way to get the sim card then was to pay that $16 - felt cheated.  Requested for refund of $16 but rejected. Grid was okay to refund line transfer fee ($37) and rescheduling fee ($16) for me to cancel subscription.  Unreasonable service and management. Please avoid.
5,"Customer service officer, Kaye was fast and efficient in resolving customer issues.  She is also empathatic to customer's problem. Thumbs up!"
5,"I had paid and received my gridmobile simcard, however i did not read the FAQ properly before i signed up.  I was using m1 PRE-paid card when i registered for gribmobile. So i had to change my m1 number  to postpaid before the port out process can start but it still was unsuccessful due to my outstanding balance with m1. All that while for a few days i was communicating with gridmobile staff via email and at times voicecall. Gladys at first and then Ivan. Both were  very patient with my situation and help me out however they can by explaining and suggesting. I am very pleased and thankful for their service even if i had cancelled my port out. Thank you again :)"
5,"SeedlyIn, I signed up as Investor when they were previously known as New Union, they have speed up Auto Invest, Alfred feature, P2P. Investors are given a clear specifc understanding before deciding. Yes I love the fact they changed from DBS and adopted, OCBC, which enables swift decision making for investors to start to log in their funds. MAS Regulated, excellent, reliable choice for those looking for small P2P lending platforms. With Good returns of investment, ROI."
5,Greatly develped app that is easy and straight forward to use. A very good alternative investment platform for investors! Highly recommend to those seeking passive income with only S$1000 as minimum initial requirement. Supporting Seedin and its vision to help SMEs in their businesses and at the same providing individuals opportunity to earn. All the best and keep up the good work!
5,"SeedIn¬†provides a platform for investment reviewing and monitoring of potential crowdlending projects . I like the fact that you can start investing with just $1000.The ease of application process and the attractive risk-adjusted annualised returns from 7%, which come in the form of monthly repayments are some of the reasons why I choose SeedIn.¬† I love that their mobile UI was very user friendly, and my favourite feature on the app has to be Auto-Alfred which help me to invest my funds in a timely and seamless manner as long as the deals fit my criteria. ¬†I also like that we are updated every step of the way! ¬†  ¬†                                                                                                         Technology really¬†simplifies the investing process for busy people¬†. You can consider SeedIn if you want to invest and support local SME"
5,"New to crowdfunding platforms and find Seedin pretty easy to navigate, with useful features and information for investors. The app is added convenience as well. So far all‚Äôs good and now waiting for investment to mature. "
5,"Seedin is a highly recommended p2p investment platform. Being a foreign talent in Singapore Seedin gave me a broader opportunity to invest my hard earned money.  From newbies to experts in investing, Seedin ensures that their methodology is easy to understand and not rely on the conservative way saving like bank. Seedin is a good alternative way of investing and helping new businesses to flourish. What I loved about it was an easy application, secure verification of investors and they provide updates about the investment and any upcoming projects. üëçüèº"
5,"Their application process was fast, mobile app is user friendly and their factsheet is very useful too. Have just made my first investment recently. Look forward to the return!"
5,"SeedIn was introduced by a friend and turns out to be easier to use as compared to other p2p platform in Singapore. In-short SeedIn provides a platform for investment review and monitoring of potential crowd-landing projects. The investment can start as low as $1,000 which is affordable for any working adult. SeedIn mobile UI is absolutely user-friendly and you can view their stuff on the go. There‚Äôs an Auto-Alfred which will assist in investing the funds in a timely, routinely and seamless manner as long as the criteria are met. Updates are also sent along every step of the way. In addition, the application process and risk-adjusted annualised returns start from 7%, which comes in monthly repayment modes. My honest opinion as a day-to-day office worker; ‚ÄòStart investing and grasp all available opportunities before it‚Äôs too late‚Äô. SeedIn provides you the minimum effort input investment and gives potential returns. Hence, I don‚Äôt see why not. That‚Äôs that. "
5,"I first heard about SeedIn from a friend who used to work there, and I decided to attend an information session to learn more. Lucien, the Business Development Director, explained the simplicity of their system, and also how much work goes into researching and approving potential borrowers. He also highlighted how they take financial management so seriously that they have best-in-industry practices to manage the handling of the funds. To date, they have not had a single default from any borrower, so they're doing something right.  I have invested in one borrower so far and the process was straightforward. The app is pretty clear about verifying your details, transferring in funds, and they also provide updates about the investment and make it easy to participate in upcoming investments. I trust them with my investments and look forward to investing more in future."
5,"SEEDIN equates to:  S uperb investment alternative E arning passive income  E fficient team to answer your queries D iversification of risk  I nvestment as little as $1k N o defaults thus far   Even if there is late payment, SEEDIN would ensure close communication with the borrower and to ensure payment. It‚Äôs definitely a win win situation for both lender and borrower, and definitely better than putting yr money in the bank!"
5,Great platform to invest for passive income! Love this P2P as another option for investments. The staffs are efficient and there to respond to your queries. Everything is perfect so far. Keep it up!
5,I am happy with the overall investment platform which enable me to invest a min sum of $1k. I can invest a few with that $1k instead of locking into 1 investment.  They have recently changed and speed up the process of funds transfer which benefit investors. Glad that they take the feedback seriously. Looking forward for more investments to come. 
3,"I tried Seedin once and still collecting my monthly repayment now. Not many options available and some are repeated funding. Information available on platform is quite limited. I do not even know which company im funding in. Giving the risk and the less transparency on info, I think there are better investments. "
5,"Great and simple to use, not to place full saving here but take this as part of the total portfolio.   "
5,Decided to give it a shot after i chance upon your Facebook ad. Seamless and hassle free transactions. Prompt and friendly customer service too! Two thumbs up!
5,Tried 2 other p2p lending platforms available in Singapore and must say the experience with Seedin is the best. Prompt repayments and transparent communication assure me it is a trustworthy platform. Min. $1k investment sum for each deal while for some other platforms is higher. You're always updated when a deal is available (avg. 1 deal every 1-1.5mths) and interface is easy to use (mobile/web/app). Auto invest function is very useful as deals get fully subscribed fast. No defaults or deals gone wrong thus far but all investment carries risk so always do your due diligence!
5,"Loving this crowdfunding platform. User friendly website and analysis of facts given is useful. Typically long tenor (higher risk) but compensated with the higher interest. A minimum sum of investment is $1k is imposed, which probably explains why some of the newly opened investments get snapped up so fast. That can be a good or a bad thing depending how one looks at it. But overall, very satisfied with Seedin. 5 stars no doubt. Keep it up!"
5,"SeedIn is an also alternative way to earn passive income by committing 1k minimum sum for investment.  The Apps is efficient and fast and easy to use and is user friendly . Do consider to sign out and register the SEEDIN app and see for yourself . Just a disclaimer , it is also a high risk investment as it is a P2P lending platform to startup company . But overall is a great potential to generate passive income for yourself if you have spare cash "
5,"A relatively simple investment platform to use with 1k as the minimum sum for investment. Investment payout was also very punctual. Furthermore, SeedIn has taken feedbacks from investors seriously and has changed their fund transfer method so as to speed up the whole process of depositing funds. All in all, it is a good platform for potential investors to try out!"
5,"Investing since May 2019, cannot comment on default rates yes as my time with them is still too short (interest payments have been prompt so far, they typically structure loans with bullet repayment of principal at point of maturity)  Pros: - the thing i like most about them is the speed of topping up. typically takes a couple of hours for them to verify the top up of funds. Their deals are also typically quite big with minimum investment of 1k so it is generally quite easy to fund out unless your investment amount is really big. No more depositing a lump sum and leaving it waiting around doing nothing - i find their factsheets to be quite detailed (similar level to funding societies)  Cons: - most of the loans are larger so if you have limited capital then you may not be able to diversify as much (I typically use another platform for smaller loans and Seedin to fund out larger amounts for deals that look acceptable to me)  Overall good experience so far. Recommended if default rate continues to remain low."
5,What I love most about seedln is the min $1k investment amount.  I have tried out a few investment deals in small amount and so far all are good.   Keep up the good work! 
3,"Funding requests not as much as funding societies, but nicely screened.  Generally min 1k SGD per investment, though no limit up. (first come first serve basis??) Not regulated by MAS and official said p2p funding doesn't need to be regulated? Start recently, fund have to transfer to a ?private ocbc account instead of escrow (vistra trust dbs account), official said to facilitate management. Not much disclosure and statistics provided Recall that withdrawal fee applied during fund withdrawal if not wrong.  SMS me (using a private number) to win a 50 SGD worth capitaland voucher by leaving a ? favourable review.   "
5,"Having a passive income is what everyone dreams and works towards. Besides shares and minute bank deposits, Seedin is another way to accelerate your portfolio. Seedin has both App and website platforms to login and you may choose to auto invest or manually choose the different investment deals that interests you. You can expect streams of monthly payouts through a minimum $1,000 per deal. Queries are easily answered by a phone call away or through emails. "
5,"Excellent platform for safe investment. Seedln staff also capable and knowledgeable in their job. Profile of potential investors were also being given in detail to the best knowledge. Processing system is also used friendly in terms of funds top-up, fund withdrawal and investment. System is provided with security."
5,Easy to use and understand. Good returns potential. Alternative source of investment for young risk takers!
5,"I have been using SeedIn for a few months now.  The signup process was very smooth and fast. It took no time at all for my account to get approved for me to start using SeedIn.  The app itself is easy to use, and very intuitive. You can easily see your investments, and other relevant information such as the amount invested, maturity dates, and the interest rate.  Fact sheets are well written, with sufficient information to allow you to make a decision on whether to invest in a particular project or not.  The Auto Invest function (called ALFRED) can also be set up easily. You can set the parameters, and ALFRED will do the investing for you.  Overall, I am a very satisfied user of SeedIn :)"
5,"SeedIn is an incredibly easy to use platform, especially for a rookie investor like myself. I enjoy reading their deal factsheets where SeedIn publishes unbiased findings of available loans. Coupled with their stringent loan assessment, makes investment on SeedIn a safe and reliable wealth growth platform!"
4,"The interface is generally easy to use and the fact sheets very useful in assessing the investment even for a normal person such as myself. I hope that they will improve the interface for recognizing transfers to their account as it‚Äôs a little concerning when it takes a few days to reflect, but their customer service is generally responsive as well. The auto invest is an great feature as it helps make the investment once it opens without investors having to rush online at a specific time. All in all, a pretty good app so far, even though as a new investor I haven‚Äôt yet received any returns."
5,"Seedin is a great platform to dabble into P2P lending investments - it is a breeze to use and shows clearly the level of risk you're getting into, detailing the background of the company you are interested in investing in. It has a convenient auto-invest feature and top-ups are usually reflected within a working day, which is very fast. Currently its default rate is zilch and I would really recommend Seedin for potential P2P investors who want a fuss-free platform to start!"
5,"Auto Alfred function is a good feature which allows us to just park the funds and ready to take advantage of each new campaigns. Definitely useful for busy investors who wants to monitor the market but do not have time luxury at their side. I like how Seedin sends updates on new deals available as well to keep us in the loop. Definitely friendly for novice investors and retail clients who doesn't have much capital to begin with, yet having the exposure to make some profit through investing in equities! :)  "
5,"SeedIn platform is a breeze to manoeuvre, even for a novice like me.  The email push function is a useful reminder for upcoming investment deals and the auto-investment function is useful for busy people. I like the transparency of being able to read the feedback of each potential deal and also view all my different investments that I have partake. "
5,Great platform to grow your funds. Can offer lessons to users who are beginners to understand more. Great platform to grow your funds. Can offer lessons to users who are beginners to understand more. 
4,"easy to use app interface, though there is a more steep barrier to entry than say funding societies due to the $1000 minimum sum per loan (as compared to $20 for fs). thankfully no defaults for me thus far! and they also have rewards for those who gain points through referral or making many loans, which can be used to offset the cost of commissions! but do remember to use these reward vouchers before doing any loans (as I forgot to do that twice and these reward vouchers have an expiry date..). loan interests go up to about 10%, probably not as high as funding societies but thus far no defaults so that's slightly better than fs! responsive helpdesk too!"
5,"SeedIn makes investing simple & seamless. Here are some of the features I enjoy most whilst investing on SeedIn:  ‚úì There seems to be a rather rigorous KYC (know your customer) process to screen the borrowers as I have yet to experience any defaults ‚úì Beautiful, easy to understand deal factsheets simplifies investment jargon and lowers the learning curve for p2p investment, which is suitable for new investors like myself ‚úì Alfred Auto-Invest allows me to allocate funds to deals that suit my risk appetite ‚úì Credit Scoring System allows me to make better decisions when it comes to diversifying my investment portfolio ‚úì Constantly new updates and initiatives that improve the credibility of SeedIn ‚úì Live chat - Good & prompt customer service  Things that can be improved: - Mobile app user interface can be a little confusing at times - More deals on the platform, currently around 4 to 5 deals per month  Overall, a positive experience with SeedIn!"
4,"If you could improve in your top up making it friendly user, would be much appreciated. Now I am trying out for the 3rd investment which started in September month. Overall your fact sheet with your recommendation ease investors load of due diligence study on any investment considerations which is useful. Keep it up. If I have any friends interested in crowd funding, will introduce to SeedIn."
5,"Great alternatives investment platform, the platform is great for working class who have no time to read through tons of reports, everything is summaries well and risk appetite is also factored in. However the number of investment projects are very few and far in between. "
5,A great platform for investment. Greatly recommended. Easy to ise interface and also includes great education materials.
5,Seedin is easy to use. It allows me to earn interest more than any bank and make me feel safe. I can do it any where anytime using their app even when I'm overseas for work and I won't missed any chance of earning high interest. Seedin also organise monthly events and allow me to learn new things not just investment. 
5,"The application process was fast using Singpass. Customer service replies really promptly to solve any issues. Default rate is not an issue, less than 1%. Withdrawals are made hassle-free and is quick too."
5,It‚Äôs a good app to use to diversify your investment portfolio .the deals are usually completely funded in a few hours and would have to use the automated bot to get your allocation. However it would be better if there were more deals each month . So far there is only Like 3-4 deals per month. I also like their track record as they have a 100% repayment rate so far. Keep up the good work!
5,"The platform is very easy to use and navigate. The investment deals are competitive and easily been snapped up in less than 30 mins. Either you have the fastest finger or you can use the automated investment tool, Alfred to help you to snap the deal. So far, I have invested in 3 deals and no defaults yet. The investment evaluation team has done well in curating the deals. Hope to see more deals coming in soon. "
5,Really good user interface and navigation tools . The credit reports and company background information for the loan section is also very insightful . There could be some improvements for the companys‚Äôs garantor and their assets . Overall the platform is easy to use and the loans are easy to understand . Plus they haven‚Äôt had a default for their p2p loans since their inception so highly recommended :)
4,platform is easy to use and user friendly. Good secondary income for people who doesn‚Äôt want to take high risk investments.
5,"The concept is good. I have invested in a 6 loans and so far all payments have been prompt. SeedIn will sent out email in advance to alert us beforehand. They recently changed to OCBC for faster deposit which is helpful. The loan opportunities are not that frequent but I understand that‚Äôs because SeedIn need to do their diligence in selecting quality borrowers, and that explains their 0% default rate thus far. They will include a detailed report on the borrower for us to decide if we should invest in it too. Though at times I encountered some loading issues of the report. SeedIn are also prompt in their queries reply which is very important when we have any doubts. I‚Äôll continue to keep myself vested with SeedIn and monitor my portfolio with other platforms. Cheers and keep up the good work SeedIn!"
5,I have been using this platform for secondary passive income for a couple of years. Very prompt with the returns so far. Giving better interest rate than banks and shorter duration. It is a marvellous platform for alternative passive income! 
5,"Easy to use platform! Registrations and investing was straightforward. It is indeed a fastest finger first investment platform! Often, the deals were snapped up in minutes! "
5,"Very convenient and easy investment platform. Auto invest feature is awesome, transactions are clear cut and keeps us updated promptly."
5,Excellent! Love the platform. Very easy to use and user friendly. Invested 1k to try and am putting in more.  
5,"The app is very easy to use and they will update new deals via email so you don't have to manually check the app. So far haven't encounter any defaults from the deals i invested in after using the platform for a few years. Each deal also has fact sheets for investors to review. Withdrawal is also quite hassle free, just send a request in the app, and it will be processed in 3 working days. Generally I think its good for people who wants to try investing via p2p platforms but still recommended to do their own research against other platforms. "
5,I am not from Singapore and I am eager to open a Seedin SG account. I am glad to be able to register after completion of the necessary requirements which is so easy and hassle free. SeedIn gave me opportunity to invest outside my local SeedIn account and help borrowers through this platform.
5,"Legit. Stable and realistic returns every month. As good as it gets. And best of all, fuss free with no advertising gimmicks many other financial tools tend to do."
5,Easy to use and provides an alternative platform for investors looking to diversify their portfolio :) 
5,Definitely the best P2P platform around. Easy to use interface with comprehensive research tools to aid both new and seasoned investors. 
5,Seedin is definitely one of the top performing platform for P2P lending. None of the projects that I invested in have defaulted so far. The app and features is also very convenient and user-friendly! 
5,App is easy to use and navigate around. Was introduced to this platform by a friend. Fuss-free sign up and funds transfer too.
5,Earn good interest with with certain risk. Interactive Platform and Easy to Use. Limited amount is need per project.
5,A friend referred me to this platform. It is a great app to invest while assisting SME. Angel from the client success is very informative and she is able to answer all my queries and assist to complete the registration. The app is user-friendly and easily to manage. I would definitely introduce and recommend this platform to my friends. Hope to see more project in this platform. 
5,I am a SeedIn investor for the past 3 years now and I have been happy with the service in general. I would recommand this platform to any investors as it is friendly and easy to use.
5,A friend referred me to this app and its really very good. Invest part of earnings and results looks pretty decent. User friendly lay out which is easy and clean to understand. Admin team are also prompt in responding to enquires. Keep up and highly recommend to others whom wants to invest.
4,"I have done the first signup at the WeConnect Event. Signup was quite smooth. But be prepared to have your NRIC and Crop it properly, to attach it to the form.  After which, place a $1,000 deposit to start to participate in the P2P lendings they have.  They also have AutoAlfred, a auto allocation of funds for each P2P deals that they have. It allows you to customise (after your Client Knowledge Assessment CKA) the deals you want, and auto-invest (up to 65% will be allocated from the various deals they launch). Then the remaining 35% left will be given to manual bidding.  From the date i join till now, their deals are all fully booked. I am currently happy with it."
5,"First I was skeptical because I thought it was one of scam apps. Nevertheless, after read all the review, I give it a shot. They have very tight processing in term of application which give me the confident in their p2p. Everything is very smooth then including lending and receive borrower payment. Do give it a try for another source of side income."
4,"SeedIn platform is simple to use and easy navigate around the system platform.  A good  and better user interface features are essential for user,By constant gather feedback from user enhance the system feature. Education and loaded information videos and documents in the platform is the plus side.  The investment fact sheet may need to publish a day or two before the investment be carry by investor. On the manual investment of the deal.Should be further slim line down.Keep it simple and straight forward.  As input the amount  to be invest on with confirm button to firm up the deal (no more additional OTP) as the investor is personal log in the system to to invest in the deal. Same or a day top up amount to clearance check and credited to investor account is the good enhancement to the seed in platform.  Too little amount of deal in a month time frame.Do review more quality deals bring into the platform.  Look forward constant investor interaction of Seed in connect events in the future"
4,"SeedIn is easy to use and register for, good for rookie investors. Seedin has good user interface but some features can be further enhanced for convenience. The good thing is that they publish fact sheets that helps you to understand the deals better. "
4,"Seemly are very conservative when it comes managing & assessing risk for investors and hence there were no defaults on loans in recent years which is a huge success! However there are still room for improvements as for higher risk projects investors wants lower quantum with higher returns and vice versa, currently all projects comes with minimum $1k investments which may not be so great for new investors who want to be more cautious in the beginning "
5,"SeedIn is a platform for P2P leaning. Apps are easy to use. And their ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äù function is great, ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äù can help you to invest in the project before the project is open for investors once you active ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äù. Can earn quite a good investment  return using SeedIn."
4,SeedIn is a very good platform with excellent customer service. It keeps me updated about the latest changes and notifies whenever a deal is about to occur.
5,"Friendly application to use, convenient work processes to follow, and very responsive staff to help you with all your queries"
5,"I have been close to a year using SeedIn. And at any investment, there is always a risk. But SeedIn has made investing so easy and trustworthy.  Thanks to the people behind SeedIn"
5,Seedly is based in singapore. It is one of the best place to be able to invest. What is the best part that it is guaranteed returns. Do signed up today! 
5,"Excellent customer service, keeps me updated about the latest changes and notifies whenever a deal is about to occur."
5,"Signing up and investing with SeedIn has been one of the easiest and painfree experiences to date.   The sign up portal is easy to navigate and I created my account and was accepted as an investor within 2 days!  Funding and getting started was even easier. I did it all using the SeedIn app. With the app I can track all my investments, see new opportunities and get reports on my profits. The app is easy to use and very intuitive.   Looking forward to more profits with SeedIn. "
5,"I opened an account with SeedIn during their first WeConnect Business Seminar on 22 Jun 2019 .  Initially on a smartphone, I used Firefox Focus browser to access their website for account opening. Then I encountered issues uploading my proof of identity photos. The staff there then informed me to use Google Chrome instead, which resolved the uploading issue.  Funding my account was easy via FAST and usually settled within 2-3 business days. Note that they recently changed their custodian bank account from Vistra Singapore to OCBC bank.  There is an option to invest in the deals automatically via their ""Alfred Auto Invest"" feature, which is useful for me, as I seldom login to my account to invest in the deals manually. Remember to add at least one auto-invest rule in addition to enabling ""Alfred Auto Invest"", otherwise the funds will not be automatically invested.  Highly recommended platform!  "
4,"Customer service and mobile app is rather good. The drawbacks would be that as compared to other funding companies that returns back interest together with part of the capital monthly, Seedin only returns the capital at the last month, which could be a long time of 6-12 months. Investors would not be able get back any of their capital until end of the tenure. Punctuality of return of capital could be improved too"
5,App quickens the who process of  deposit and withdrawal of funds. It also helps investor to get informations update timely. 
4,"Since 2015, I have been investing with New Union which was later renamed SeedIn. All my investments have performed positively with interests as stated in their agreement. Their deals have been transacted without much personal monitoring. I also applaud the SeedIn team for their timely response to ALL my queries. I am happy to have invested with SeedIn.  "
5,"Love seedlin. It has provided me with the most hands-off investment platform since 2016. So far, have not failed me. Kudos to their teamüëç"
5,"SeedIn's Web and app interfaces are very clean and easy to navigate. Registration is straightforward, so is the topping up, investment and withdrawal process. Kudos! "
4,"The Seedin app is easy to use. However, there are some hiccups here and there with the OTP. Seedin and has a rigorous selection process, which results in a 0% default rate and Alfred autoinvest simplifies the investing process for busy people"
5,"I have been investing through Seedin since April 2019, and I must say they really are one of a kind. I feel like a part of their community, nurturing and empowering local SMEs to grow and succeed. Thumbs up!"
4,"Easy sign up process and topping fund was fast.  However,  till date, have not joined any fund as there is no available fund to join yet.  Waiting...."
3,"App interface is relatively easy, payment method was a hassle previously. not sure about everything else as it was recently downloaded. "
5,It was a little complicating for me to navigate and understand how crowdfunding works initially but when I got onboard with SeedIn the process is then seamless and I like that we are updated every step of the way! 
5,"Thanks for making investing a no-frills experience! As a noob, I have gained much (financially obviously) from this!"
5,"What impressed me the most is the attentive characteristic of the staff when I called through to share how we could improve the money transfer procedures. They really hear us and now it's reduced to within a day. On investing side, auto Alfred function is a good enabler for us to just park the funds and ready to take advantage of each new campaigns. Great to see how technology really changes the way we invest for tomorrow. Good job "
5,"I have been using SeedIn since early 2019. The reason i like to invest with SeedIn: They have impressive stat sheet (0% default); their mobile UI was very easy to use, of course the auto-invest feature is a plus point; and it feels good when i am supporting local SME."
5,"The application process for SeedIn was smooth and straightforward. After the documents are uploaded, it was easy monitoring the progress of verification on the dashboard.  Some of the reasons I chose SeedIn are: the ease of depositing funds, the competitive returns for deals, their pristine track record for loan defaults. My favourite feature on the app has to be Auto-Alfred - helps me invest my funds in a timely manner as long as the deals fit my criteria. "
3,"Signed up for the card due to the one time $150 cash back reward for $800 spend within first 2 months. For its main monthly rewards, it's a so-so card. The hotline is quite bad, had to hold more than 20 mins during non peak. "
5,Card can be used every where.  No problem using it when I am overseas.  Phone service staff ever ready to help when I called to enquire on my card 
2,Signed up for this card a couple years back to get a free Samsonite luggage after spending ~$5k. Currently still using it but not frequently. Only when there's dining discounts or when I use it along with the free HSBC Entertainer App. The HSBC Entertainer App provides 1-for-1 deals. They limit the options but still pretty decent :)
2,"Signed up for this card 3 years back to get a free luggage. After that i paid for part of my lasik surgery with it to use up the credits upon signup.   Then i redeemed whatever rewards i could w the points accumulated and left it there to collect dust. Cancelled it the next time they charged me annual fee.  But if you're somehow alr using a HSBC card, pls look in your inbox for a promo code to get the Entertainer app for free!  "
1,"Used to own this card for many years back.   Last time sign up for the gifts and cash back.  After this,  don't have much benefits and deals anymore and they don't keep up with competitors too. Thus unless they have good gifts that you wanted, there's seems no reason to apply or own this card.  "
1,"Used to hold this card, nothing fantastic and signed up due to bank promotions. Regretted it and hope my review will prompt the rest to think twice!"
2,Nothing fantastic. The cash rebates for supermarket and dining etc have been outshone by the BOC Family Card. I dont see a point to use this card frequently unless there‚Äôs a specific HSBC promotion with the retailer or airline. 
2,"Used this card before. While online expenditure and dining rebates are decent, the card has been bested by BOC Family card.  Other than the discounted Golden Village movie tickets which is far better than any other bank's credit cards or rebates. This card dosen't have much to shout out."
4,Love the fact that there is no expiry date to miles earned. That‚Äôs a major plus especially if it takes you time to chalk up those miles. I suggest using this for major big ticket items. 
2,"Used to be the best miles card around with little to no restrictions on the types of transactions eligible for miles.  However this card is getting heavily nerfed come October 2018. Based on the new card agreement on their site, a whole bunch of transactions are now excluded from earning miles. The most egregious exclusion  is &quot;any top-ups or payment of funds to payment service providers, prepaid cards and any prepaid accounts&quot;, which will likely affect Paypal transactions. Bill payment will also be excluded."
5,Card can be used to clock mileage.Redemption can be done easily without hassle..  Customer service staff are very helpful
5,"After much comparison of the different card in the market, this card is one of the best card. Miles point doesn‚Äôt expire and 2 VIP airport lounge access! "
5,My most used card. Miles that don't expire is really enticing. Overseas miles earned are enticing too! Save for the future! 
4,One of the pioneer and popular card in the miles arena. Not one of the highest paying miles card. But Key benefits are the non-expiry and free airport lounge pass. 
5,"This is the best card after comparing in the market, as it dunt have expiry date for the miles point and get 2 vip lounges annual, who dunt want such card like this. "
5,"Citi have the best miles card in town. Reason why, our miles never expire, tied up merchant having the most and also miles conversion the best "
4,"Application was seamless, fast, and convenient. Easy to use and good for beginner miles chaser. Got 2 free priority pass access yearly."
4,My go-to everyday card for no special particular reason. I like the interface of their internet banking and fast updates on allocating the miles. Citibank also has one of the most airline transfer partners. 
4,Pros:  - Good for general spending - Miles do not expire - Many miles programs available for conversion  - High miles per dollar for selected merchants - Free lounge pass yearly - There is basic travel insurance that comes with the card  Cons: - Not as fantastic if you are accumulating miles for large ticket items - Low mile per dollar for all generic spending
3,"Good:  - Approved in 2 days - Miles point won't be expired - A lot of promotion discount for flight, hotel, dining and shopping  Bad: - Take long time to convert your transaction to miles - Some daily transactions like top up ezlink card, won't be converted to miles"
4,"Not a fan of miles but willing to hold this card for it's renewal miles bonus of 10,000 miles! $1 to 50 miles. Best ever deal already. And the miles do not expire. Plus it does have a decent miles earning though not the best."
5,"Good card for earning miles and getting yearly free access to lounge using priority pass, with annual fees waived:)"
5,"Although it's not the card that gives the highest airmiles per $, it's one of the rare ones with no expiry date. Perfect for individuals who do not spend huge amounts on a daily basis "
4,"This was my first ever credit card in Singapore so I'm kinda attached to it. My main regular spending each month aside from rent is for insurance premiums, and Citi PM card grants miles for that. I understand not many other cards do that.  Granted, 1.2 mpd isn't much but these miles do not expire as long as they haven't been converted to a specific airline program yet. Foreign spend gets you 2mpd, plus you get 10k bonus miles when you pay the annual fee.  In addition, you get free travel insurance if you charge your flight to the card and 2 free lounge access per calendar year via Priority Pass.  It's a very dependable and useful general use card that has served me well over the past 8 years. It's still my main card and I don't foresee that changing anytime soon."
5,One of the must have credit card if you are accumulating miles (General spending = 1.2 miles per dollar).  Points that will never expire and points are not awarded in blocks of $5. What's there to complain. lol.
4,"Sign up for this card during the sign up bonuses with miles.  You get two priority passes to use for airport lounges around the world, however all local spend is at 1.2mpd, which is entry level but not much. You might want to get this card if you are chasing miles because the miles dont expire and you can get 10000 miles if you pay the annual fees of $192. Otherwise, try other cards if you are more into dining or shopping. "
4,Standard Chartered card don‚Äôt have minimum spending for rebates! Plus promo currently give first 3 months spending at 3% Cashback (Limited to SGD$200 Cashback @ 3% promo cash back rate though) 
3,one of the lower miles cards - 1.2miles per dollar.  you be better using uob privi for 1.4 per dollar  
4,"Was offered this card and the Citi Rewards card years back via a marketing offer. Didn't even hit the minimum income then (which was 60k). Great card to accumulate miles on, though the conversion could be better than 1.2 mpd. Love the bonus 10k miles that comes when you pay renewal, and that there's no expiry to the miles, unlike most other miles cards. Using it for my daily general spending, until I can get access to a better converting one with no expiry to miles."
4,"For the average air miles chaser, Citi PremierMiles card is a good-to-have card in your wallet. I have this card for 2 years and mainly using it for foreign transactions (2 miles per S$1) and with the recent Apple Pay promotion on 4 miles per dollar, pretty much everything until end July!   It may come with a strict 50k annual limit (no harm trying if your income is in 40k+ range), but perks include 2x free Priority Pass per year and complimentary basic travel insurance if you charge your flight tickets to it.  Pros:  1) Earn air miles for a lot of categories, even insurance premiums 2) Frequent spend promotions with bonus miles i.e 3.5 miles per dollar for foreign spending between Dec 2017 and Feb 2018 3) (until end July 2018) 4 miles per dollar on all Apple Pay transactions 4) nice black card design (lol)  Cons: 1) Customer services can be inefficient when tracking promotions. Case in example, it took me multiple calls and 2.5 months to get all 3.5 miles per dollar for the January foreign spending promotion, even though TnC stated you get the bonus after 2 months. 2) Irritating marketing SMSes from the bank, especially when using Apple Pay or when bill statement is ready 3) Base 1.2 miles per dollar for local spending not practical for dedicated local spending  In a nutshell: Good for travel/foreign transactions & for paying insurance premiums. "
4,"I use this to collect miles - enticed me because the miles never expire and you can use it to redeem various tickets or hotels from around the world. Sign up during promotions - I remember getting up to 42,000 miles (i paid for the annual fees).   Other than that, easy to use card + great citibank mobile app that helps u track all your credit card charges. "
4,"I recently got my Citibank Premier Miles card a few months back, so i will be doing up a comprehensive review on it. Ideally you would want to get the card online from Moneysmart as it will involve getting around S$120-150 dollars worth of NTUC Vouchers. i got mine from the physical ION Citi Branch and was entitled to the 120 dollars Cashback (note that the 120 dollars is only awarded if you spend a minimum of $200 for six months and you only get $20 each month for six months. Take note of this if you do not see the 120 being credited immediately and in smaller amounts instead.)  I would say that CITI PremierMiles has one of the most comprehensive list of affiliated airlines to it and every mile accrued is equivalent to 1 air mile. Just a rough sensing, a return flight on miles , on SQ, from Singapore to London and back is 70k Kris Flyer Miles which means you would need to gather 70k miles on this card. However, as daunting as it sounds, there are certain ways to boost your dollar to miles ratio. Currently CITI is having a promo where if you use ApplePay to wirelessly pay for your transactions instead of VISA Paywave, you get 4miles for every dollar spent. Also certain sites such as expedia/online travel sites have higher payouts than the usual 1:1.2 miles for local transactions, but i would think that the Apple Pay deal till 31 July 2018 is the best and most fuss free. You do not even need to take your card out, just wave your phone!  Also, something very unique that this card has is the chance to apply and be a PriorityBoarding Pass member at major airports. This allows you the access into the airport lounges where there are amenities such as WiFi, drinks, working space to get your emails done etc. You are entitled to 2 complimentary visits a year and i would definitely be trying this for Changi and Sydney in my upcoming trip.  In case this was TLDR for you:  Pros: 120 Dollars Cashback Rebate when you sign up 120-150 NTUC Vouchers when you sign up online with MoneySmart. Comprehensive list of affiliated airlines to exchange your miles. Starbucks 10% Rebate (this is separate from the usual miles you get.) SHELL Petrol Kiosks Special Rebates (i am unable to provide information on this.) Yearly complimentary passes to lounges across major airports. x2 1:3 miles conversion overseas if you travel a lot. Random promotions every few months. (recently qualified for a 200 dollar cashback for spending 400 dollars in one month by 31 March 18. Another ongoing promotion is the 50dollars cashback for referrals.) Miles never expire, so you dont have to worry about using them up short term.  Cons: 1:1.2 miles conversion locally is not the best. 50k annual income requirement. 120 dollars cashback is split into six installments and requires you to spend 200dollars for 6 months. To qualify for the cashback, you would also be handed a SMRT Citi Dollar card and a credit loan card. However you do not need to activate them, just let them idle till you collect your 120 dollar cashback and break the card physically to prevent unauthorised use. App interface is mostly good, but my peeve is that it does not breakdown the miles individually. "
3,Only worth it for its sign up gift provided you have big items to spend on (e.g wedding or a 2 week travel holiday).  Its general spending miles to expenditure conversion rate is not one of the best and its selected onlines $1= 7 miles is really for onlu selected few sites.
4,The card has good sign up bonus if you have really big spend coming up. Citi premier Miles also never expire and can change to wide range of airline partners. Earn rate is quite Low though. 
5,"Its' a great general spending card with a history of a decent sign up bonus.  Pros: 1.2mpd on local spend 2 mpd on overseas spend Higher mile earning rate on expedia, agoda and kaligo Points don't expire Larger pool of airline partners compared to other banks 10k miles upon annual fee payment  Cons: Points don't pool  If you intent to get this card and is new to the bank, I would recommend to wait and hope that their sign up bonus returns. Nonetheless, a great general spending card to have in your team!"
5,"The best hassle free savings account. With rate of 1% up to $50,000,  above $50,000 will be 0.60% which is still pretty attractive.    Pros:  1. Signing up for the account is hassle free. Everything is done online; even signature.  2. Initial deposit of $1000 is not that high and reachable amount for many.   3. No minimum balance is needed. No fall below fee.  4. Old but yet easy to use interface.  5. No atm card issued. But can be applied for $10. Helps people not to touch their account.  6. $5 per counter withdrawn. Helps people not to touch their account.   Cons: 1. People and are not tech savvy may not appreciate online applications as they may deemed not secured.   2. No atm card issued. People may find it a hassle.  3. Old interface. People may not like it compared to interface like DBS/OCBC.   Ultimately, CIMB fastsaver is a worth it to put in. "
1,"One star purely for their digital services and customer service.   Their website and app are terrible. Really outdated interface that usually just doesn't work and have to try later in the day. Most recently, I tried logging into internet banking, and the site doesn't recognise the OTP from their own security device. Customer service hotline shuttled me around to different people, before someone told me in the middle of our call that they are experiencing high call volume and someone will have to call me back... Take your money to a bigger name bank and save yourself the hassle. "
4,Pros:  (1) Hassle free to get 1% with no T&C   Cons: (1) Online banking is not as user friendly as other local website 
4,Hassle-free to park your excess funds! Convenience is key and you don't have to fulfil any criteria. Worth a try!
3,It is a good account for those who want to deposit excess cash without having to fulfill monthly commitments. Not as applicable for young adults who are probably able to maximize their interest in other programmes.
3,Decent interest of 1.0% p.a. and pretty no brainer account but I'm letting go to move to HL Finance Fixed Savings Account to earn the 1.65% p.a. just by doing a monthly GIRO amount.
5,"Good for someone without income. No requirements to fulfil, and no fall below fees. Much better than a normal savings account!"
5,Good savings account with no strings attached. No need to pay bills or credit salary to get the 1% interest. 
3,"Pros - Low minimum initial deposit - Start earning interest from SGD 1,000 - No fall below fee, just that you won't earn the interest - Easy to set up - No funny T&Cs, straightforward - Great for keeping some money aside for whatever reasons eg: savings, emergencies, year-end present-to-myself - Difficult to withdraw money > no impulse buys! - Hardly any spam mails on promotions - I received some sort of free insurance for an electronic device (undertaken by SOMPO), not sure how useful this insurance really is but hey, it's free, can't complain  Cons - CIMBClicks is really really un-user-friendly. It took me 2 days to figure out how to see my account balance - Difficult to withdraw money > if you have a serious real emergency, you're gonna have a problem, they don't have a PayNow option - Hardly any mails at all, not even on your monthly transactions details. So you might even forget you have such an account and keep your money in there for perpetuity"
4,"I've always had a CIMB FastSaver account to store the extra money from my Multiplier account as it gives me 1 percent for doing nothing (no minimum sum, no need for spendings on their credit card). Can't say no to that! Highly recommended if you're tired of interest but ties to fulfilling many requirements!"
3,Am using CIMB FastSaver to deposit allowance for my parents / help them save! Customer service is great since not many people use this bank I guess. Only downside is that it is hard to track transaction history and there are not many ATMs around Singapore.
5,"Fastsaver as it name suggests, is really fast, simple and no frills for savers. You get that high interest monthly without any min period of holding or complicated terms and conditions. It is a good account for holding excess cash balances instead of putting in measly 0.05% saving accounts"
5,"Hassle free, can open the account online.  Been having it for about 2-3 years? Happy that I can really see the compounding effect of the 1%. Plus no need to worry about meeting requirements and minimum spending etc.   Online banking platform is simple too! "
5,"My favorite savings deposit account.  No frills account and easiest to earn 1% pa !! However, only up to S$50,000.  You can open account online and approval is pretty fast."
5,"Best account for students, fuss free with not much restrictions. Plan to use it with POSB Cashback when i start working. "
5,"Great accounts and fuss free applying, simply apply online with just a click away. 1% p.a. interest for first dollar up to S$50,000, as long as a minimum S$1000 is maintained in the CIMB FastSaver account on any given day. For remaining balance above S$50,000, an interest rate of 0.6% p.a. shall apply."
4,"It's a great account, fuss-free and simple to understand! I like that it's easy to set up an account too.The process could be better improved in the sense that they could pre-empt questions and set pop-up answer boxes along the way so we could fill up the form more easily. "
5,Very useful tool to keep your funds flexible. 1% no frills interest rate for the 1st 50K.  Able to set aside money on a monthly basis and watch it grow!
5,Do not need to be tied up by fixed deposits and yet enjoy high interest without any hipcup. Awesome plan
5,"saving account  with almost Fixed Deposit rates, the entry amount is low and can enjoy higher interest rates!"
5,"Definitely one of best no-frills savings accounts that gives 1% pa. No salary credit, no minimum credit card spend to contend with. Ideal for temporary deposit of funds above typical savings interest rate."
5,This was my other option after ocbc 360 changed their interest rates. Highly recommend you guys use it too! 
4,"Honestly found it pretty inconvenient to apply as I prefer doing it at branches itself, but then again the lack of branches probably helps to force saving habits:)"
5,"1% per annum for the first 50k!   Best deal in the market for young savers! With no multiple condition, this is the best you can find!   Wait no more! "
5,It's one of the best interest rate (1%) given for a normal bank account. Best place to park your liquid cash in due to the ease of transfer. 
5,"1% for 1st 50k no frills interest rate for the win!  Please help support Fastsaver, save fast, save with CIMB.  "
5,"Absolutely fuss free for a savings account that gives 1% interest without working for it! There‚Äôs no monthly spending / salary credit needed, unlike the other banks. "
5,"Been using their credit cards for few years, they have good benefits for in store shopping, just recently using their banking that I find great fuss-free account for both current and savings.  Which does not have mutiple hurdles for interest rates. I just hope that the app could have been more user friendly. "
5,"Unlike others saving accounts, This is a Fuss free savings account and has high return of interest.  "
4,Pretty good alternative with less conditions as compared to BOC or OCBC where there needs to be many fixed conditions in order to get additional bonus. This give more flexibility anyway.
5,Best way to save without the need to worry about terms and conditions. If only the returns can be higher for those that would keep the money locked up
4,Greatest fuss free account for savings. Do not have mutiple hurdles for interest rates. App interface could use a redesign to be easiler to use. 
4,"Been using this for close two years now, no minimum spend or amount to be put in. Very straightforward and good for starters with no salary credit yet."
5,"Fuss-free savings account for all people that requires a basic high-rate savings account, with close to no strings attached."
4,"Fuss-free and straightforward without the need to jump through loops to fulfill various criteria. However, interest rates are therefore lower than competing savings account. The good thing is that there are not too many ATMs so it can force profligate spenders to save."
5,"Fuss free, no conditions at all and you get the 1% interest. Recommended for people that do not have salary credit. "
5,"No frills bank account which gives you 1% interest p.a. without doing anything (no need salary crediting, no need pay bills, no need cc spend, no need anything!). Perfect for those who wants to just stash their extra cash after hitting the maximum on other bank accounts which gives higher interest (DBS Multiplier, UOB One) or for those who unable to hit any criteria set by other banks.  Do note that the account does not come with any ATM / Debit card and thus you are unable to withdraw cash from their ATMs (they don't have a lot to begin with lol). You can request for ATM card but there is an additional charge for it."
3,"very straight forward, fuss free account. only problem I had was they only have 2 CIMB branch in Singapore and the employees kept messing up my account - e.g. couldn't get a pin to activate the card that I paid $10 for. had to make several trips down to CBD to get it fixed but the staff kept giving me conflicting instructions until I decided to just close my account. in short, great account that I""d love to have but execution and service could be way better."
4,Fuss free savings account that doesn't make u just through hurdles! 1% interest with very high upper limit. It was my savings account of choice a few years ago in the days of low interest rates. Thanks Cimb
5,Why put in other savings account when u can get 1% from cimb. Its a no brainer to use this especially for new babies.
5,I find cimb fastsaver one of the best savings accounts out there in the market. Good interest rate and fuss free banking
5,It is the easiest 1% p.a. interest for savings account. no conditions needed. love it! Been using CIMB for the past 2 years. Just transfer excess savings over there and let it earn the 1% interest.
5,"No minimum amount, no minimum spend and no hoops to jump through. Great for those who cannot meet the criteria for other savings accounts."
4,A higher interest savings account in town with no conditions in place. Pure and simple. That's why i place my funds in this account. 
5,"Easy to set up the saving account, with 1% interest.  One of the best saving accounts in the market. "
5,"No minimum balance required, no conditions like other banks and it‚Äôs easy and fast to set up. Highly recommend!"
5,Cimb fast saver is really good with the 1% interest on the first 50K. I signed Hk with them because they offered a $29 sign on credit per account opened with them. I like that this account is simple and fuss free.
5,"Easiest fuss free way to get a decent 1% on your savings! Currently using it and good, forces me to save and the setup of account is very easily done online as well"
5,"Simple, fast and fuss free. Highly recommended for people who wants convenience:) my whole family is using them!"
3,Use if you have maxed out your high yield accounts. Ocbc savings goal is sufficient to lock up the money while earning high int rates. 
5,"Not the highest interest rate out there.. But hassle free easy money, no need to jump through any hoops for that 1%. However its web interface leaves much to be desired. "
5,"I really love CIMB fast saver because they always offer the highest interest rates and very unique promotions like Chinese New Year deposit promotions , sign on bonus , and many more! They give a lot of incentives to retain their customers."
4,"With no minimum balance, and an online only way to transfer the money, this account helps me to be a disciplined saver. Interest rate is decent.  Definitely would recommend to people who are looking to be disciplined savers. "
4,this savings account is simple and fuss free for people like me. it is easy to use however the interface and user flow is dated
3,Useful product lacking in local sgd deposits market... Hopefully they hike the rates higher soon given the shortfall in funding liquidity for smaller size foreign banks like cimb 
5,Hassle free in opening and with 1% interest with no loops to cross.  Best deposit account so far. It is also good for people to save with a normal saving account 
4,Great place to place your funds with no extra terms and conditions and earn 1% interest! Have been using it for a year and so far it has been good except the user interface on the internet banking is not too friendly
5,"I hv this fast saver account for some time already. 1% interest, no minimum, no fees. Just leave my money there & anytime need money, I just do online or on my mobile. So easy to use even tho I‚Äôm a senior citizen. "
5,"Signing up was quick and hassle free. Everything is done online, down to the banking. It makes for a good way for youngsters like me with no salary to save as it is 1% interest!"
3,Hassle free and easy to sign up for an account online. However navigating through the interface is a little difficult.
5,"Fuss free, simple and straightforward account. Great alternative account to stash away excess money to earn no-frills 1% per annum interest rate, which does not require salary crediting or credit card spend. The graphical user interface has rooms for improvement, although basic, as of now it does serve its purpose. "
5,Easy and hassle free saving account with great interest rate! Has been using it for myself and one account for my boy :) 
4,"Setup of account was very fuss-free and immediate. Minimal requirements needed to attain the 1% interest rate which is great as an emergency fund account.   Wished they could upgrade the internet banking and mobile app platform to be similar to Malaysia's CIMB platform in future though, the CIMB Singapore platform is very basic compared to Malaysia's newly upgraded platform.  Update: Realised during my recent login that CIMB allows immediate transfers to Malaysia CIMB accounts at zero transaction cost! I havent actually tried this out myself yet, will update on the foreign currency rate when I do so at a future date (: "
5,I love CIMBFastsaver because it offers the highest interest rate without and terns and conditions for a savings account. The interests also comes in on the last day of the previous month. (And not on the 9th of the next month like some other banks saving‚Äôs account) 
4,I like this bank. Easy to transfer money and not touch it. Love the 1% frills-free interest it gives. Have recommended to my friend too and she will be taking it up soon!
4,"Application was basically hassle free, everything can be done online. It's everything you would expect in 2018.   The interest rate is also at a competitive 1% for a savings account (assuming no salary contributions, loans, etc.) This easily makes it the top choice for students and NSFs.  Further, the lack of atms means you have a higher probability of saving as it makes withdrawing tougher, if you buy that logic...  My only annoyance is their website and app user interface, it needs a revamp to keep up to its competitors. Taking 1 star away from here. "
5,Great interest rate of 1% especially for tutors like me with no monthly salary! (No ocbc 360 or dbs multiplier üò¢) 
4,Nice interest rate of 1% and no fee for below minimum amount in the account. Can easily open account online too :) hassle free and convenient... 
4,Pro Simple and hassle free.The minimum amount is 1k which is easy to hit.  Cons Mobile apps is laggy.
4,Good account if u have excess money yet easier to take out and earn decent interest:) would surely recommend to use this account
5,"I had this account since start of the year. It is a decent account if you need a place to park your money and yet doesn't want to put in FD, etc. Interests are credited to your account monthly. To transfer funds in and out of this account, just use FAST transfer. It is almost instant. The ease of opening an account online from the comfort of your house is a plus point. "
4,Just recently open an account with fastsaver. Took awhile at the Orchard branch on a Sunday but it's all good for the 1% pa interest with no frills. Only downside is the outdated online banking interface - they should just follow suit with the Malaysia site!
4,Easy to setup and within 1-2days for acct to be approved and you are done! Only downside. The website doesnt seem very interative or simple. Mayb thats me only! 
5,1. Straightforward account for interest accumulation 2. Account (even joint account) can be created online 3. Difficult to withdraw cash but that's the whole point of saving   
4,"Hassle free. Auto-pilot to earn one percent interest without any prerequisite such as salary crediting, bill payment or credit card spending."
5,"Simple and easy to apply. The rules are simple and no string attached (1% interests). I have been with CIMB FastSaver for about 6 months, they do not have a minimum balance fees which makes this a very flexible account to use."
4,"Hassle-free account to earn 1% and it comes with internet banking. You will need to request for a OTP device to facilitate fund transfer out of CIMB. If you intend to use this account to pay for your monthly bills, then you need to transfer your money out as it is not one of the local banks with access to electronic payments.  "
5,"Dont have this account yet, but a 1% on the first $50k does sound good compared to my existing account. Worth a check. Initial deposit of $1k is also reasonable."
3,"Pros: CIMB FastSaver account was pretty easy and hassle free. Just leave your spare cash in there and just let the 1% interest to just roll. I switched over my funds from ocbc 360 to CIMB just to earn that easy 1%. Furthemore, you can take out the money as and when you like!   Cons: interface both web and app is kind of dated. But if you just want to view your funds and do simple functions like transferring of funds is good enough"
5,"been using this account for my joint savings with my fiancee. 1% interest, hassle free. would recommend"
3,Fuss free to get 1% interest with no salary crediting and spending required. It is a good account for students with no salary. 
4,"Super easy to open an account online and do online fund transfer from other bank accounts. 1% interest is super great compared to other accounts, but only up to 50k balance.  The only con so far is that the online banking GUI is painfully medieval compared to other banks."
4,"hassle free, no conditions, easy to use with FAST transfer to other banks when you need the funds.   I use this as a monthly deposit piggybank so I won't spend the money.  I just wish the iBanking was a bit less last century."
5,1% interest on account balance. No questions asked. No terms and conditions.  Need I say more? GO SIGN UP NOW. And yes you can do it online.
5,"Am using CIMB FastSaver and I like it because   1) No T&C (e.g. Min. monthly spend, charge bills to this account etc)   2) 1% interest on an account meant to keep growing my money (Quite far from the $50k mark so not an issue for now)  3) Fully liquid (Am not penalised for withdrawals)  4) No ATM card also helps me to not touch my money.  5) I could set it up online ,with some mailers (PIN and internet banking token). Pretty convenient 6) No min. balance 7) Allows for FAST transfer so I can move my money from bank to bank real quickly  What I don't like: 1) The interface of the cimb internet banking is a little bit unfriendly -  But that also helps me want to touch it less as I hate to login to transfer funds.   "
5,"Pros: 1) Easy to open account - all online based 2) Simple and fuss-free. You maintain $1K to get the 1% interest and no other criteria, like salary credit etc 3) Good for storing emergency funds as there is only 1 (or 2) ATM in Singapore so you can't withdraw freely 4) On the FAST network, so you can transfer money out immediately to other banks  Cons: 1) Outdated Internet Banking interface. "
4,Love it. Fuss free and quick to get account number online or over the phone. Don't even have to wait for the slow mail to reach your place or go down to any bank branch. 1% interest rates is way above what other banks are providing for basic accounts.  I had to deduct 1 star because of the interface. It's too primitive.
5,Easiest account to earn 1% with no conditions! Really good for students and retirees who can‚Äôt fulfil other conditions to get higher interest
5,Easiest account that earns considerable interest. Fuss free with no criteria to fulfil. Earns 1% on the savings. 
4,I got this account for joint account saving. It‚Äôs good for force saving and no lock in period. However the interest is not very high 
5,"Straightforward bank account which makes saving simple. As it does not come with the multiple criteria to earn a higher interest, the rate is lower compared to local banks, up to 1.8% p.a and there is no fall below fee involve. Will stick with the local banks to enjoy better interest."
5,high return in intetest just you deposit S$100K in your account. Insured up to S$75k by SDIC. T&Cs apply. Sign-up gift available. No min. spend. No cashback cap. Up to 5% cashback*.
3,Not bad good pricing easy to claim good customer service over all good experience will recommend friends
3,I was once a user however it is not a competitive product in the market given that only 1% interest.
2,Nothing special really. The local banks are offering much better deals for better service.   Definitely choose local over foreign.
3,"Good account with pretty good interest without having to worry about minimum spend or other transactions.  However, since they encourage account holders with to go cardless (to get a card you need to pay for it) the user interface for mobile and online banking is rather lacklustre. Logging in is a huge problem on the app."
5,"Hassle-free sign up. Took only 3 hours to approve. Applied using Singpass MyInfo, all the details were immediately captured automatically. Awesome interest rate of 1% p.a. with absolutely no criteria, which I love. Would recommend to everyone, it's a no-brainer!"
5,Love this fast saver account get substantial interest without needing to do anything.  Put in money here aft using ocbc 360 account :)
5,The easiest and simplest way to earn the highest interest rate without any conditions. I simply love this account. The only issue is cimb atm is scarce. 
5,No frills and hassle free saving account with no hurdles at a good 1% interest.   The only cons is it's digital only banking but the convinience of FAST transfer make it easy. 
4,Everything has to be done through online otherwise counter charges exist. One of the highest FD rate offered as compared to other bank. My usual saving account 
5,Fantastic account with attractive interest rate for short term savings and emergency cash with no multiple conditions needed. Online account opening process was smooth and easy too! üëçüëç
4,Interest rate is a flat 1% and cannot compare to other high yield savings account. But this is by far the most hassle free account with no conditions required.
5,"Not much requirement needed to earn maximum interest for students as compared to normal savings account ffrom OCBC, DBS & UOB."
5,I just this account for a simple but yet higher interest of 1% p.a (compare with other bank accounts out there) joined account with my fianc√©e. No complicated terms and condition.  You can create a standing order on POSB/DBS to auto credit a certain amount into the CIMB account. 
3,"I used it previously. Was good when interest rates were low, now 1% is not really competitive with rates rising... "
5,"Best savings account for extra cash, 1% interest with no requirements like salary credit or minimum spending.  Applying for the account can be easily done online, just need 1 working day for account activation after transfering initial deposit of $1k.  However, iBanking interface and app needs some improvement "
5,"*My review is specific to its joint account application process. Overall, the process was intuitive, user friendly, and sleek! Took less then 15mins to setup my joint account :)"
5,"Great interest rate for a savings accounts! Fuss-free, simply & easy to open online within 10 minutes. Highly recommended for users who do not wish to lock in the funds for a period of time with higher interest as compared to other savings accounts!"
4,Fuss free account which can be opened online. 1% interest with no strings attached. The limited nos of branches / ATM make it not as accessible as the local banks but in a way is better for saving coz withdrawing is inconvenient as long as you chunk aside your ib device. 
5,"Excellent for regular liquid savings. No hoops to jump. 1% interest up to $50k savings amount. Money is liquid as you can use it by transferring to any other account / bank easily by internet banking. Only downside is there‚Äôs no ATM card or Cheque facilities. But it‚Äôs mainly for savings, so those facilities are unnecessary in my mind. "
5,"Shockingly fast in opening the bank a/c. Everything done online inside my bedroom üò¥. No minimum balance. 1% pa for idling money is a good deal. With FAST, it is effectively as good as the money is still in my main DBS a/c. Excellent customer service. Called me when I emailed a query over. I missed the call. They bother to even call back again! HSBC would never bother calling again! Lol!"
5,"I have this account too and park most of my cash here, as it is straight forward and easy to use. Their credit cards comes w/o annual fee too so that is very attractive for me."
5,"I'm really amused by how fast the bank processes one's application. Accounts usually get processed within a day. A minimum of $1000 is required to be deposited into the account in order to earn the 1% interest rate p.a. Great savings account for starters who want to park their money into a competitive interest paying account with no additional strings attached. Only for the first $50,000. Anything above that amount would be pegged to another interest tier. :)  However, the internet banking interface is not very user-friendly. Very confusing and hard to navigate. It takes time to get used to the interface. Hope that CIMB would revamp their internet banking interface soon!   "
5,"Had this account for over a year and never regretted it! Very hassle free and convenient. Opened the account online, didn‚Äôt have to mail anything or go to the bank even though I‚Äôm not an existing customer. One thing I really like is that there are no fall below fees so I can move my funds around anytime or even leave it empty without getting charged. The downsides are that the 1% is only for the first $50k and there must be minimum $1k to earn interest, but so far that‚Äôs not a problem for me."
4,"Pros: - Simple no frills 1% interest for your first $50k. Not a lot, but better than 0.05%. - No extra conditions needed e.g. salary crediting, credit card expenditure etc except you need min. $1000, making it one of the better options if you don't draw salary. - No fall below fees or lock in period which is great! - Purely online through ibanking which makes it quite simple to settle (don't have to head down to the bank)  Cons: - If you really need to go the bank, it's quite inconvenient. - You'll be charged fees if you wish to withdraw over the counter/ATM, (but no fees if doing ibank transfer). - Online interface isn't user-friendly! A little troublesome if you aren't IT savvy and takes a bit of experimenting to learn how to use it.  Overall: Good account to use if you don't draw salary or just to park your cash after you've hit the max amount in other salary crediting accounts. Inconvenient online interface to learn, but all you really need to know is how to transfer money out (for me at least). "
5,fuss free and no issue. It also allowed predefined description/code for FAST transfer (good for things like funding societies and capitamatch when you need to deposit fund)
5,"This was the easiest account I‚Äôve ever opened in my lifetime. Did it entirely online & totally fuss-free. Completed the process in 10min flat. No queues, no endless paperwork.   It gives the highest no strings attached interest (1%) for initial $50k - 5x more than my premium account.  Moreover, no minimum balance is required.  This account is great for funds that need to stay highly liquid - emergency stash, warchest ready to invest. Funds can be transferred out immediate via FAST. "
5,"A very simple to use savings account. Designed for the person who is just keen to save up and earn 1% up to the first $50k.  As a family, we signed up for my parents and basically, we contribute our monthly sum to that account to let it earn that 1% p.a.  Also, many people may not know but actually it is SDIC $50k insured and the CIMB Clicks Online interface is not too shabby as well! Online approval is quick."
5,"Just like its motor insurance arm, Sompo traveljoy is one of the more competitive travel insurance out there. In terms of pricing and coverage for the various components, I believe its value for money.  The buying process is simple and can be bought online from Sompo official website via credit card. Promotions are quite frequent and there is no need to enter a promo code as the discount is automatically offered and computed.  I chose the deluxe plan for a one week trip to Vietnam in December last year as it provides more comprehensive coverage on watersports activities. I arrived back to Singapore and fell ill the next day with fever and visited a GP.  The claims process was simple through just uploading a photo of the receipts and medical tests done online on Sompo website. Fast and efficient. I called a few days later to check on the status and the service personnel told me the claim was approved. Cheque received within 2 weeks, faster than the time Vietnam airlines took to replace my damaged luggage üòÅ  Overall value for money and recommended. I have purchased again for an upcoming trip. Of course, I hope that I wouldn't be needing to make any claims!    "
5,Covers unutilised travel expenses for cancelled or curtailed trips. ... All overseas phone charges will be borne by the insured.
2,"Purchase of insurance was hassle free. But when you want to make a claim it delays for a few weeks and claim may not be claimable. There is no guarantee even though you report a claim. They request for doctor diagnose and if the diagnose statement requires payment to obtain, sompo will not reimburse it either. "
5,I apply Sompo insurance for almost any travel overseas. Their quick and easy to claim process makes it feel completely flawless and we can enjoy our trip with a peace of mind. 
5,"Sompo TravelJoy is by far my most fav travel ins.  It is rather competitive in terms of pricing and overall coverage.    Claims are processed pretty fast.  If I do not remember wrongly, my mom's claim for post medical bills is paid out within 2 weeks or earlier. "
5,Bought this travel insurance many times. No issues with making claims and customer service. Responsive and flexible when I need to make any changes to my plan.
4,"Bought this during my travel to japan in 2018, as it has a plan called Go Japan! Which is specially tailored plan for travelers to Japan Cashless Services, Free Translation Services over the phone when you seek treatment in clinic/hospital.   It has also covered Emergency Medical Evacuation or Repatriation required due to a Pre-Existing Medical Condition.  As for claim process, I have not tried it out yet."
4,"Bought the annual plan last year for my family because there would be quite a lot of travelling involved. Sompo had one of the more attractive rates and decent benefits coverage for Asia Pacific, so we decided to get from them. Application was quite smooth and simple. Thankfully there were no major accidents so no need to claim (heng ah). To be honest 4/5 is 80% approval, because haven't tried the claiming process yet (don't ever want to claim anything for this kind of thing lol) "
5,"My family and i have been using sompo for all of our travels for the past few years, as it offers one of the most competitive pricing for travel insurance. Our travel claims are fuss-free and hassle-free too! "
5,TravelJoy offers attractive discount of 40% throughout most time of the year for single trip. It also has one of the better post medical expenses incurred upon return to Singapore within 72 hours. üëçüëç
5,Always there is travel promotion like up to 40% off.   Fast and prompt claim.   There is one time I forgot to bank in my cheque. More than 6 mths which bank dont accept. Informed Sompo and they send a new cheque with no admin fee.   Thank you!
5,I always travel with sompo travel insurance especially to japan as it has additional perks! Easy claim process as well.
4,Easy to purchase and questions are promptly answered via email.  On my first year annual trip with them and of course its like a safety net. Hopefully i made a wise choice ;) 
5,"Sompo Traveljoy offers one of the more competitive pricing. Have not submitted claims for this insurance, so cant comment on the process. "
5,This travel insurance was recommended by a friend and I've been using it since last year! It's really easy to sign up for especially for those who don't really have much time to sit down and read over a long text. Very easy to use!  It has the best price for the coverage I need as well.
5,Have been using Sompo insurance since 2017 as it is very comprehensive and reliable! Price is also very reasonable for someone on a budget like me. The first insurance that comes to my mind whenever I need a travel insurance :)
1,"Terrible claims process. I stupidly trusted the reviews of financial comparison websites that just focus on the coverage features and not the claims process. I forgot to check google reviews. Now I'm claiming for luggage damage and it's incredibly slow & still unresolved after 3 weeks. went to check google reviews, lo & behold, all complained about the horrible claims process."
4,"Bought Sompo for my last trip to Japan. One thing that should improve is definitely the clarity of products. The information on the website wasn‚Äôt very clear to helping you to compare and decide which plan among their various plans are more suitable for your needs. However, it was a natural decision to get Sompo since it‚Äôs a Jap company, and there was emergency Japanese translation phone calls for a nominal fee. Thought that gave me a better sense of security in case of emergencies in Japan."
4,"Sompo Traveljoy offers one of the more competitive pricing in the market and also covers terrorism-related claims unlike some of the other companies. This can be critical as my companions and I once got stuck due to an airport closure because of terrorism-related events, this cover would allow making alternative travel plans easily without worrying about additional costs.  The travel delay benefit now covers unexpected delays too. Easily purchased online, fuss-free and quick!"
5,"It's one of my favourite insurer, not because we work together but they are fast and responsive.   Claim is a bliss with them for my self & clients. For myself, i have claimed on flight delays. It is 10 hours delays. Most companies only allow claim very 6 hours while sompo's requirement is 1st period is 6 hours followed by every 4 hours. So this is one of their unique features. "
4,"One good point to note about travel joy is that it does cover pre-existing conditions for medical evacuation and repatriation (Not for Vital plan).  Cons of it is that for many adventurous sports, the coverage doesn't extend to them. "
4,"I usually go with this option via my insurance agent for longer haul flights/ longer trips (e.g., to the US, Europe). Have claimed once for damaged check-in luggage - claims process was fairly fuss-free. "
5,"I had signup and ported to Amazing 8 plan (Promo Launch) at $8/including GST on the second day of launch in June at their local agent store in Jurong West HDB.   My Amazing 8 Plan (Promo Launch) includes 2GB Data with Unlimited Basic Internet at 128kbps thereafter, Free incoming calls, 150 minutes outgoing calls and 10 SMS. No contract, free SIM card and free wavier of $10 registration fee. Roaming data to Malaysia is free.  Signing up at their local agent store was a breeze, took just 10 minutes in total. The agent took out a redONE tablet, keyed in my personal particulars, including a digital photograph of my NRIC. I was given a new redONE SIM card. NO payment was given. The billing cycle will start from every 1st of the month.   I was surprised how efficient their backend was. The redONE SIM card was activated immediately after signup. Porting from M1 was processed and completed in the evening at 6PM on the same day.   redONE piggybank on Starhub network. Reception wise on 4G network, on above ground and in buildings/shopping malls are excellent. I could get full signal bar on my mobile phone. Calls are crystal clear and I have never experience any drop connection.    However, in the MRT underground stations and moving train, data reception is patchy especially along EAST-WEST Line. Although I get a full bar connection signal, data speed on 4G network is slow and sometimes loading of website or facebook is not possible. I have to manually switch to 3G network to get any data coming in.   On data roaming in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, I could manually connect to Maxis or Digi but not redONE. Strange, I was wondering why. The data speed at 4G network was painfully slow, using Whatsapp chat and Facebook Lite were possible but slow. Instagram and google map were unable to load.   I have realised that redONE counts data in blocks of 1MB instead of 100KB in other Telcos during their first 2 months of launch. Hence, I was wondering why my base bundle of 2GB ran out so fast. Unlimited data speed at 128kbps after 2GB base bundle was usable. Whatapp chat, Facebook Lite and Opera Mini were usable, but slow. Nothing loads on Google map and Youtube. After my feedback to redONE, they now counts data in blocks of 100KB starting from August 2019.    redONE has a simple 1app which I could install to view my usage, enabling my IDD/Roaming, adding extra data at a cost and view/pay monthly bill. Notification and payment of bill are all done through the 1app. Currently payment of bill through the app can only be done using e-nets, although I preferred Credit Card payment.  During the NDP month of August, every user was given an extra 2GB data allocation. A very nice gesture for their loyal customers to stay onto their subscription with them.   However, current $8 Amazing 8 Plan promotion, has data allocation of 3GB and 100 minutes outgoing calls. I had contacted redONE if I could upgrade to this plan. The answer was 'NO'. I was slightly disappointed that even I was on a no-contract plan, I could not upgrade or downgrade my mobile plan.   Nevertheless, overall using redONE was trouble-free and fuss-free. The pricing alone at $8/month was super attractive even for a light to medium data user, without any worries for hefty extra data charges in Singapore and Malaysia.   "
5,REDONE services are prompt and efficient. Customer care service can be easily reached via different channels. So far the plan is affordable and reasonable and useful for my old aged parent. Network is reliable. 
5,"Hi to all phone user, if u always go malaysia for hoilday, supper, etc..  I recommend u to use redOne mobile..  Sg roam over to malaysia is fast, 4g data works great.. Best of all.. One data subscription can use both countries.. Highly recommended as i own couple of redOne line for my families.. "
5,The plans offered are Affordable & with reasonable price.  Catered to all consumers with different needs. Awesome üëèüèª 
5,Been using redone for a month and i can say the speed of the data is superbly awesome..it works just like those known telcos and they offered great promos..
5,"I signed up RedOne when SingTel increased the price for its Malaysia roaming 1GB plan from $5 a month to $5 a week! Ridiculous service provider. Then RedOne offers just $8 for 3GB data roaming a month. The reception has been good all around Malaysia, in Desaru, Mersing and KL. Well done, RedOne!"
4,"Best deal in Singapore and some say JB!  New MVNO and I rushed to sign up on their first launch day. Sign up was smooth and quick, my line was ported over in a few days.   My monthly subscription dropped from $50+ to $18 right away. Not only that, I get free caller-id, free roaming in malaysia, and twice as much 4G data.  No more bill shock as unlimited data will kick in after I exceeded the quota. No complains compare to the over-priced post-paid line that I paid for over 10 years.  Suggestion : please extend the 6GB plan to first batch of subscriber like me. Also, please have a way to auto charge my subscription to my credit card."
5,"APPLICATION and/or ADDITIONAL SIM?  Seamless Application process via the local partner. The entire process last no longer than 15 minutes and gotten my redONE SIM. $0 UPFRONT payment. Kudos to their backend operation as the SIM is activated almost immediately after signup. Smooth.   ADDITIONAL SIM?‚Ä® Thinking of getting additional sim for work related or for a kid to use at home? Look no further, their Amazing8 at $8/monthly with 3GB (4G LTE) data with unlimited basic connection afterwards ease the burden of BURSTING data cap. In addition, there‚Äôs unlimited calls among all redONE Singapore users provided. Why spend more for something you don‚Äôt need right?  CONNECTION STRENGTH? Undoubtedly, this telco connection impressed me. Whilst travelling regardless of in tunnel or at camp sites, there isn‚Äôt a significant drop in the connection signal as compared to my previous telco (not pointing fingers). PUBG and Mobile Legend definitely require good connection signal.   In summary, this is EXTREMELY worth it. If you‚Äôre reading this look no further than here and sign up tomorrow.   "
5,"I signed up for the Amazing8 plan during their sign up promo about 2 months ago. Registration was simple and completed on the spot in less than 5 minutes, with the port in completed 2 days later. Since then, have never had a reason to contact customer service. Reception has been good, billing is correct, and bill payments are easily done through the app. Would be better if payments could be done by credit card instead of nets only, but can't complain with the rest of the service quality and price!"
5,So far so good coz they use starhub network. Easy to pay bills. There is only some places that have no coverage maybe due to starhub base station.
4,Great to use in Malaysia for the price given. . Only setback is have to manually choose Malaysia network provider. Highly recommended
5,I was glad having this plan from this Network. It was very cheap and I really like it. I am ratkng it in 10/10 I have a lot of inquiries before it wa sanswered easily and yhey communicate thru whatsapp anf I am very glasd for their service. Thanks.
5,Pick up Redone since June and I have been enjoying the good network since then... The best part is the when I am in KL for work. I do not need to pay data roaming since it shares the same SG data plan. I have recommended to many of my friends and they are so glad to had found Redone
3,I have signed up for two different plans. But unable to combine both account using one redONE app or to sign up for two app accounts using the same mobile. 
5,"   I signed up for the 8$/mth plan, though the throttled data speed, after the bundled data, is slowly, but other than that, the networks coverage (using starhub's network)  is decently covered. the one thing i like about the RedOne data, is that it includes data roam to Malaysia, which is pretty useful, if you visit MY often. :)  Last but not least, the responsive Customer's service is via WhatsApp, which is super convenience and super awesome! cool!  thank you RedONE! "
5,Signed up for an Amazing 8 plan over 2months.Amazing NETWORK for me travel to Malaysia over the weekends.Good reception in Genting and Johore .Still have balance data which i can use in Singapore. 
5,This has been the plan I waiting for. Similar data/call min amount to my existing plan but at only 25% of the price! + It has data/call in Malaysia included! I travel to JB weekly so this is just very handy. To me the best deal out there.
5,I signed up for an Amazing 8 plan. Turned out to amazingly useful for my roadtrip to Malaysia over the national day weekend. Truly is data without borders! Seamless lock on to the roaming partner in Malaysia (Digi). Good reception in Genting and Melaka. Still have leftover data which i can of course use in Singapore.
5,RedOne may not have large data bundle to compare but their key value is the convenience to me and my family when we travel over the causeway. No more scary data roaming charges nor the need to swap sim cards anymore! 
4,The plans offered are Affordable & with reasonable price.  Catered to all consumers with different needs. Awesome üëèüèª 
2,"The most affordable plan in Singapore with 3GB, 100min and 10 SMS ($8.00 after GST). Had alot of issues with my family members' port-in, and no compensation was issued. So the customer service is not great. No hotline to call, only a Whatsapp messaging Service and Live Chat on the website. Looks like they mightve outsourced to Malaysia."
4,"New telco from Malaysia promoting the same cost effective and fit for purpose plan every month. THey are using Starhub network so line is not too bad but sometimes still can be lagging. I subscribe to $8 per month plan and l like the internet sharing between Malaysia and Singapore.  Some pro and con in summary Pro: 1. Cheap for light user 2. Can call malaysia like Singapore number without additional cost 3. can whatsapp their customer service. Slow reply but still responding. At least can capture the history  4. No delivery service for sim card   Con: 1. Internet is slower and lagging sometimes at certain places and underground, even though they use starhub network 2. No customer service phone line as they do not have Physical office 3. Their partner (challenger) is just a staff helping to sign up the plan, some can be ignorant and couldnt care more as this is just a ad-hoc service. i spent 1.5 hour in CHallenger to register.  "
5,"It gives you a peace of mind as you travel around the world. Get the most comprehensive coverage at a reasonable value and focus on enjoying your holiday, or business agenda. With a flexible premium charge, only the first 3 days are charged in blocks; all subsequent days are charged on a daily basis."
5,"I had been using TransferWise to send money to Malaysia for my parents couple of months already. The cost is transparent for each transaction, it will stated clearly how much they charged. Usually within the day or next day can received the money depends on what time you make the transaction. The exchange rate is much better compared to DBS. Overall experienced was good as of now. One tip, make good use of your first transaction, as the fee had discounted for first transaction."
5,"I used TransferWise twice to transfer money to a KRW denominated bank account in South Korea. The process was pretty foolproof and straightforward and the remittance was settled pretty quickly (same day during office hours).   The site offers multiple options to pay including PayNow and credit cards albeit at different charges, but i thought it was really convenient to have multiple options readily available. They also offer a comparison tool to see which method poses the lowest charges."
5,"I've been using TransferWise for a long time to send money to Indonesia, and once to pay my parking fine in Croatia. My experience has been excellent. The app is easy to use, adding a recipient is straightforward, transfer to an Indonesian bank account takes as short as 1 hour, the exchange rates are competitive, and the fees are clearly stated.  Here's a tip if you use a UOB One credit card: TransferWise is considered an eligible transaction for UOB One Card cashback. The fees to send money to Indonesia is approximately 3.5% (for a SGD 1000 transfer using the UOB One Card). If you spend SGD 2000/month on your UOB One Card, you are eligible for a 5% cashback. Effectively your transfer is free, and you even save 1.5% of your transfer!"
3,"Was previously using Transferwise to exchange between SGD and Euros for a period of at least 3-4 months. Generally is easy to use, and creating an account was relatively easy as well (all via app/online).  Con: - Transfers takes up to 1-3 working days for my money to be converted - New fees introduced this year for exchange w SGD and EUR (0.43%); and with new foreign exchange wallets coming up like Youtrip etc, don't think this will match up.   Pros: - Could save an exchange rate for a few days if I'm not wrong; good if you want to hedge against exchange rate rises "
4,"I have been using Transferwise for currency remittance between SGD and CAD. Transaction-wise, it has been good, with the exception of a couple of issues/ bugs experienced from time to time when using its app,  eg. bank login failure, money transfers are terminated due to timeout etc. Adding on, its support service responds back fast within a span of 1-2 days.  Note that it will takes a couple of days before the money is deposited into your destination account. Even so, its processing fee is considered the lowest among all other similar remittance and I will definitely recommend it."
5,"I have used TransferWise multiple times.   The platform is very good.   Within the platform, we can even compare their rates against other sites.  I have used it for Indonesian Rupiahs, so far. Other sites might offer slightly better rate, but their fees are much higher than Transferwise. Transferwise has always come up top.   After the initial registration, it's very fast. Soon after I inform the recipient, they will already see it on their bank account.  I even use Transferwise as a money changer. Their rate is competitive, even compared to the best rate amongst The Arcade money changer. I no longer need to physically carry a thick stack of Rupiahs, because the biggest denomination is $10.  With such a good platform and the best value, I don't think it can get any better! "
5,"I have recently used TransferWise to transfer USD to a company's account in America for my property investment and it was fast, easy and cheap.  Although I have to pay for a fee for the remittance,  but it was really negligible since the exchange rate offered is really good compared to what I have always been offered by the banks or other companies.  I have also received TransferWise's debit card recently and the bright green colour of the card is really cool...Love it! Looking forward to see how I can benefit by using this card for when I am travelling overseas.   Highly recommended!"
5,"I opened an account with TransferWise in year 2017 , and I have recently received my TransferWise Debit Card.  Pros: - Multi-country regulated remittance business. - Has comparison table with banks and PayPal to see which one yields the most currency units for the recipient. - Has USD, EUR, GBP, AUD and NZD borderless accounts to send, spend and receive money for free (Tip: If you have a ShopBack AU (Australia) account with cashback in AUD, you can instruct it to transfer cashback to your AUD borderless account and then transfer it to your local bank account while converting AUD to SGD in the process. This method gives you more SGD units as compared to using PayPal).  Cons: - Some US stock brokers, e.g. tastyworks, do not allow linking of USD borderless account via ACH routing for funding and withdrawals, for Singapore clients.  Highly recommended!"
5,"NO-BRAINER for businesses and individuals to save money by using TransferWise to transfer money overseas instead of going through the banks and incurring high costs.  I'm a business owner and I use TransferWise to pay my overseas suppliers. Their sign up process was a breeze. Fee and the transfer rate used are simple, transparent and up-front. So far so good with no issues and I get immediate updates on the transfer status.   The cost savings justify the need to change the way we make payments for our businesses. Every dollar saved is a dollar earned. Charity to the banks is unnecessary. "
4,"Lately, I needed to perform some overseas transactions and that's when I found TransferWise. Most banks' platforms arent as straightforward, but TransferWise provided a user-friendly interface and within minutes, you can make your transaction. Furthermore, once the transaction is completed on the sender's end, a very nice fluid timeline appears to communicate to you the current status. All in all, Transferwise is easy to use, hassle-free and comes with a very nice user interface. However, it does charge a little more transaction fee as compared to banks."
4,"I‚Äôve applied to use TransferWise for business purposes. Application was smooth and customer service was efficient and knowledgeable. It is not as easy as transferring money out of your account from established financial centres, which I think will be improved in due time.   All in all, personal and business verifications were seamless. Card application was a no-brainer. It just takes a bit more effort to use and get used to. It‚Äôs an excellent remittance platform."
5,"The account verification was so quick. I was told exactly what was being verified, by whom, from where. No paperwork nonsense.   Also, really liked the touch where I didn't have to go back to my account after it was verified to pre-order the debit card. Somehow it kept track that I wanted to pre-order the card and then once the account was verified, it just did that for me anyway. "
5,"I've been using TransferWise since January 2018 and it has always been a hassle free process. The platform is easy to use and the remittances are always done within 1 to 2 business days after transferring. I've never needed to contact customer service for my remittances.  There are two features that TransferWise's Platform offers that are better than their competitors:  1. I like that you can also opt to pay for your transfer with a credit card (3% fees apply).  2. You have 24 hours to transfer your amount to their local bank account. You can cancel your request without customer service intervention and make another one if the rates are better.  Rates/Fees are competitive and are usually better than the banks for major currencies (USD/GBP/EUR). However, for some other currencies (CNY) or small sums, it may be better to use DBS Remit or other services. Transferwise does provide a comparison chart where they'll show you if their rates can beat competing services."
5,"Transferwise had competitive and transparent currency exchange rates, they allow the comparison of its competitors to show that it has the best rate (and if it doesn‚Äôt). The website and app user interface is smooth and intuitive as well as user friendly. Contacted customer support on multiple times and they never fail to impress me!"
5,Transferwise boasts a user friendly platform to carry out remittance at a lower fees and better rates than major banks. The platform also provides updates on the estimated duration before the receiver receives the funds. 
5,Fuss free with competitive remittance rates as compared to bank.  Recvd by next day. User friendly interface and you will get regular updates on the status on Ur transfer. Multiple modes of payments but I recommend using bank transfers or paynow. Iam a repeat user of this service and highly recommend you guys to try it. There is also referral for new signups. Do check it out. :) 
5,"Easy to use, efficient transfers and the ability to keep tons of different currencies, all in one account!"
4,"Used twice to transfer to indo p2p lending Crowdo. it was a little cheaper to do it via Transferwise at 100sdg each time.   For sgdusd, it is still cheaper to do it via dbs, at small amounts though. For larger amount like 1000sgd+, Transferwise will get more cheaper.  The fees is transparent, and you dont even need an account to view the fees.  There is also rates alert function where u can  configure to send an email for particular rates at the end of the day.  Ui is clean and easy to use! and your transactions get saved. You can do future transactions to the same recipient easily.   Just received my Debit card which is currently in the testing phase.  "
5,"I used transferwise to make transfer to foreign accounts for my business. It usually takes less than 24 hours. Transferwise exchange rates are often better than the best local moneychanger rates. Also, there's no hidden charges. I recommend Transferwise for safe, fast, cost effective way of remittance."
5,"I'm a huge fan of transferwise for international money transfers - it is quick , easy, and very cheap compared to other services! "
4,"Transferwise is one of the better services I have used - Better rates/ fast support response and easy UI navigation. Uploading of documents for verification or creating/setting of new recipient accounts have been easy  where there is no need for you to input in the bank codes/ branch number etc (at least from my POV when setting up my account for SG banks). Even though, it may updates its fees from time to time, Transferwise is still considerably the only one that gives better money in overall, and the higher the amount you transfer, the lower the fee."
5,"im using transferwise to transfer fund to US / EUR fund accounts. It is fast (1 day to EUR account), reliable and trustworthy. Plus, customer support is awesome and straight to the point. :). had also applied and recieved for their debit card too. transferwiseDoTcomSLASHaSLASHkelvinl85 "
5,"Will recommend it all day every day for Singapore - India money transfers.  Rates: On par or slightly better than what you can see on google/XE. Way better than bank TT buy/sell rates, even when you factor in the small fees.  Speed: Better than promised. First time transfer which had to be verified using ID took 6-7hrs. Subsequent transfers are <1hr in recipient's account!"
4,Not the cheapest option than the banks. Use to transfer money overseas using TransferWise.Experience wise is quite simple and straightforward.
5,"Been using TransferWise for more than a year now, Apps is easy to use and the rate is much better than bank. "
5,Simple to use and much cheaper than the banks. I transfer money overseas using TransferWise every month. Never had a problem 
5,Very happy. Even I (age 70) can manage the transactions. Got the MasterCard in short order and it has worked a treat. Also the helpline vg+ with a real person on the end of the phone.
5,"I have been using Transferwise for both business and personal transactions for close to 5 years. Transferwise transactions are very fast and the cost structure is very clear. I will continue to use them in the future, highly recommended. My only suggestion is to be clearer with the transfer limits, and have easier access to customer service."
5,I wish I had known of TransferWise sooner. I've been using it for the past couple of months sending money from Singapore to India and have been very happy with the exchange rates and a small fixed fee.  All banks give us terrible exchange rates with some of them adding a fee as well.
5,I am very satisfy with the exchange rate I got. I think the fee is quite reasonable. I speed of the transfer is quick. I hope the fee doesn‚Äôt go up.
5,This has helped me send money to India for cheaper.   The Transferwise multicurrency card has been convenient and great to use with zero fx margin. 
5,"I have been using the SCB Bonus Saver since i graduated and started working in August 2017. I understand that most people prefer to stick to DBS or use OCBC 360 because it is one of the more popular and safer options out there. But upon careful research, i realised that the SCB Bonus$aver has one of the most attractive bonus interest rates out there and would like to leave a positive but neutral review to educate fellow Seedly users.  Currently, i am getting 1.88% with the SCB and this 1.88% stems from a 1% salary credit (which incidentally must be more than $3000 credited with a SAL code, your HR employer will know what this is.), a 0.78% card spend (all Mastercard Or Paypass spend, NETS and Transitlink expenditure is NOT included.) as well as the prevailing base interest of 0.1% (this means that lest you are unable to qualify for the salary credit and card spend, you will only qualify for a paltry 0.10%.)  I do not have 3 bills monthly to pay hence i am missing out on a further 0.25% (3 bills of $50 each.) and could be earning up to 2.13% (1.88%+0.25%). However, assuming i have a monthly credit card bill as well as a phone bill/internet bill to pay, this will be attainable in the near future.  Explaining further in depth, i understand that the 1% salary credit as well as the requirement to take home $3000, which requires a gross pay of around $3750 and above might be unattainable for fresh graduates, yet the unique selling factor for me is the 0.78% that you can qualify for from simply spending 500 dollars monthly. This can be achieved by offering to pay for your meals with friends or families, by inculcating a good habit of using your VISA/MASTERCARD wherever you go and only using cash when absolutely necessary.   With insurance companies offering 3 year endowment plans in the range of 2-2.5%, i highly rate the 1.88%-2.13% that can be obtained, coupled with the instant liquidity of having these funds inside your Bonus$aver should you require to take out money for investment or insurance payment purposes.  Moreover, you can also sign up for the SCB Online Banking which has cheaper brokerage costs as it does not have a CDP account (instead it uses SC's own custodian). This helps to have both your Bonus$aver account as well as trading securities on a single Banking App, as well as for internal transfers. I am someone who prefers having as minimal cards as possible to give myself greater convenience instead of tracking various cards to see if i have qualified for the respective criteria monthly, and recommend the SCB Bonus$aver to both credit your salary as well as spend on it."
5,Attractive interest when we are able to optimize the card spending to get 1.88%. And funding gift with Bose ear piece is something that I m looking for
5,Very high interest if you are able to hit the card spend and the various criterias. The sign up gift was very attractive especially the funding promotion for a Bose earpiece
4,"M1 may not be perfect but being with M1 over the years for both mobile / broadband plans. their uptime and customer support is relatively good.  Speed wise, M1 is consistent for the 1GBPs gamepro plan with static IP.  Cost wise, comparable to the other big telcos which has some nice perks when re-contracting."
4,"The speed is fast depends on the location where you stay. But for the persks by M1, it is excellent."
5,Cheapest 500mbps broadband around on 2 year contract.   500mbps is more than enough for most households that do not do gaming. 4k netflix on multiple devices work well with no stuttering.   Two subscriptions in the west and southern part of Singapore for more than 2 years with no issues. Can combine both subscriptions into one bill.  Recommend to get your own wireless router. A powerful one like asus ac86u can blanket your home with wireless signal without need for wireless mesh router rental from M1. 
5,M1 has been very nice with their data provider that‚Äôs the reason for using it till now compared to other service provider. 
5,"I have been using M1 1Gbps for a good few years. For its very reasonable price of $39 per month, I find this is a good price and good speed for the majority. I'm of the profile that loves fast speed and enjoy online recreational gaming, but don't expect crazy ultra speed for heavy download or serious gaming. So this is definitely a good selection, without breaking the bank."
5,Best.Value.Ever! $29 for 500Mbps with Voiceline. You can't beat the price. Been paying $29 since 100Mbps in 2015. Downtime almost 0 in my area in the east. Accumulate enough M1 Points and offset your bill by $5
5,"Have been using M1 1GBPS for many many years now. Tie in with the phone plan for extra discount on total bill. They got a family bundle discount if you have phone plans + broadband, you get  more discount.  Good service, good up time. Very rarely face a downtime service. If there is maintainence work, they will notify in advance but usually done in the night.   Speed wise at home is good, play games not lagging and streaming netflix is smooth. Downloads are done in a few seconds too.   Pricing is really value for money. Singtel and starhub are way more expensive. Plus, I get a free ASUS router when re-contract!   Customer service so far has been quite good. Any issues are usually resolved by the customer service officer. Only bad thing is long waiting time if you call in."
4,"Stable internet connection with one of the lowest price in town.  Great bundle and promotion from time to time.  Average customer service, sometimes might take longer than usual to resolve your issues. They ask verifying questions which are a hassle. Their customer service hot line and M1 shop is not linked directly.  Overall it's still worth what you paying for!!"
5,I subscribed to M1 fibre broadband with free digital voice service. Signing up was fast and the customer service is great. Reliable broadband speed and service.
5,I've switched over from Starhub to M1 for about a year. The biggest decision to do so was customer service. M1's customer service is one of the best around. They will try their best to answer your questions and even go beyond to help you if you really need it.
5,"I have signed up and been using their 24-month contract, 1Gbps Fibre plan since Nov 2016 .  Pros:  - Competitive rate at $39.90 per month. - Option to get up to 30% off mobile subscriptions when combined with at least 2 M1 mobile lines. - SAFRA members get FREE 12 months Fixed Voice VAS Package and dect phone with new sign up of 24-mth Fibre 1Gbps.  Cons: - The M1 Fixed Voice that the broadband plan comes with, has not been in use as it requires the fibre modem to be switched on 24/7 and I usually switch it off when not in use to save electricity.  Highly recommended!"
5,"Switched over from Singtel home broadband and mobile line over to M1 and it's been awesome so far - extremely affordable price point for just what my family needs $34 overall ($29 x 12 mths + $39 x 12 mths) per month for 1Gbps (fibre) and haven't experienced any issues so far. Signed the broadband line in Feb 2018 so pricing/promo might differ. My mobile line's only $20 for 15GB, more than sufficient for my usage and similarly, no issues experienced so far. Connectivity in MRT is great too. "
5,"So far the most value for money home broadband service. After-sales support is efficient in providing installation, replacement of ONT Terminal"
5,"Best value for money as of 27 Sep 2019. $39/month (including GST) for 1 Gbps speed. Easy to install router/modem and set-up. Only one minor issue: connections tend to slow down from 4am till 6am on random days when I stay up late while watching online shows. Apart from that, I am very satisfied with M1 Fibre Broadband. Renewed my contract with them already. 2nd time I think."
4,"I was previously on 300 MBPS Plan for 2 years, and I am currently on 500MBPS, for almost a year. My review on this Telco, is that, so far reasonably reliable. After this contact date, I would up grade to 1 GBPS plan with them."
5,"I switched from Starhub to M1 around 3 years back. My rating for M1 is 5/5 because M1 serves better and has better performance on the below,   Cost: lowest in SG 29/month  Customer service : Quite good; for plan selection, i called couple of time. Able to answer immediately without any delay  Internet Quality: There is no disruption so in the past 3 years unlike other broadband providers.   Promotion: Good promotion price even for people signing up contract for 1 yr.  Fees: Considerably low fees compared to other telcos (Eg: no termination fees, while other telcos charges ~ S$80)  I recommended few of my friends and two of my friends already switched. "
5,"Been on M1 for many years cos of their low priced $39/month for 1Gbps plan PLUS you get to use your own router (unlike Singtel).  Also, their recently free Google Home Hub promo is great value at $45!"
4,I am using M1 broadband for the past few years and its serving me quite well and im happy about the service
4,Very reasonable price and able to change your own gaming wifi router. Much cheaper than other service provider in the same plan you choose.
5,I have engaged their Fiber network for my home and my parents' place. been their Fiber network customer since 2015 and what really differential M1 from the rest are their customer service - always so friendly and ready to aid.  price point may not be the cheapest but the quality of their network is worth every penny you fork out during the contract period 
5,"I am using the M1 Broadband from more than 5 yrs. and I am having an good experience with this Home Broadband Provider. There Customer service is quite responsive & contract renewal process is very smooth. Also, they provides excellent promotions during contract renewal & having very less relocation charges as compare to other broadband providers.   I could say my overall experience with M1 is awesome & I do refer there broadband services to my friends and relatives."
5,"One of the most customisable telco in SG, although infrastructure is by SingTel JV, they managed the Telco business in a customer centric model and having ""anywhere under the Sun"" slogan, they truly aspired to be one of the best service providers. Good for both pre- and post-paid services. Tons of value added service including fund remittance for foreign talents working hard in SG, they can skip the queue at retail remittance."
5,"I am using the $39/month 1gbps fibre BB plan. So far the speed is good, there are no lagging issues when watching YouTube and there were no outages."
5,"I'm subscribed to the 500mbs. Before that I was concerned whether the speed is sufficient for normal surfing, YouTube and Netflix. But after using the service for 3 months, I can conclude that this the speed is more than sufficient to watch movies even in 4k definition. So far the connection has been stable. I've not experienced any drops. The only downside is that you don't enjoy a free router so the 500mbs option is suitable for those who wants to continue to use existing router or willing to get a new one. "
5,Supporter of M1 because of the very competitive pricing! $29/mth for 1GB plan. Has been using for 5 years! 
3,My broadband was recently down but they failed to inform me. I only like their service because it's cheap - about $39/month. 
4,Have been using M1 for a few years now and so far has been reliable. Loyalty discounts are great but would be better if there are incentives such as free data on weekends for contract plans 
5,Stable connection and the speed is consistent for its promised 1Gbps. One of the more affordable (and good) options out there in the market now. Used it at my parents' place and decided to stick with them when I got my own flat.  Look out for free routers and M1 broadband promos during roadshows to really get a good deal.
4,"Very easy to apply and competitive rates as well. Generally FWD offers decent coverage for a safe travel destination. But if you‚Äôre going somewhere with higher risk involved (e.g a ski trip), you might want to consider specialized plans. "
5,The application process and ease of getting a quote upfront is great. Prices are generally competitive too. And EZ-Link app also offers additional discounts. 
5,FWD just came out with an app called FWD Flyer which is super convenient for one to look at their policy detail and also visit the doctor in Singapore after their travel without paying any cash. Innovative and forward looking company. 
1,"Very bad experience, claimable amount was around 3k, FWD threw the case to AJAX adjuster and was interviewed and indirectly threatened by one of their staff to forfeit the case and repeatedly telling me that if i were to decide to proceed with my case, i might be subject to pay their investigation cost of over 5 figures if my claim was denied and kept telling me that my chances of claiming is very low.   In the end, i decided to write to both their CEOs to demand explanation and threaten of law suit, finally they passed my case to a more professional adjuster firm to investigate for me and finally after 6 months, I've gotten my claim.  Back in 2017, they also switched off their FB reviews as they have too many unhappy customers and gotten lots of bad reviews."
1,"I had flight postponed (12hrs) once and also got 1 cancellation (by the airlines), all while having FWD insurance. The insurance company never considered/processed my claim and provided lame excuses. Even though none of this was my fault, I had to lose thousands of dollars, while having even paid for a travel insurance."
1,"Used to buy FWD for most of my travels, however, will stop using them for any policies. (PA, motorcycle, travels, home, etc...) Airline had damaged my brand new luggage wheels (3 of 4) and I had put in a claim, along with SATS irregularity report and various extremely clear pictures. Also had proof of purchase from Bangkok. FWD denied the claim, simply saying that age of luggage cannot be ascertain..! While all my photos shows that it is brand new...!! Ergo, Etiqa, Direct Asia are far better options than FWD."
1,"Cheapest travel insurance policy available most of the time but very bad service when it comes to following up and executing on travel insurance claims. Had to cut our trip short by a few days due to a medical emergency at home. Had to forego our paid hotel bookings and thought we could claim for our return flight bookings on another airline after reading the terms and conditions in the policy. Came back and submitted our claims and it took a month without any reply. Had to keep calling the company from then onwards to check on the status. It seems all travel insurance claims are managed by a third party which led to further delays. Kept getting passed from one inept claims executive to another. After taking almost 6 months, claim was denied even after submission of medical reports from hospital and other required documents. Those who intend to use FWD better pay a few dollars extra and use other insurance companies."
5,"FWD has one of the easiest to use  user interface which allows consumer to purchase their plan easily via their app.  Pros:  - Super friendly UI  - Lots of available promo code (for example: travel20 to get 20% promo) - Reliable  - Trustable to claim (see my story below)  - Can use whatsapp to claim (did that and claim successfully before)   Cons:  - Mixed comments from different agent (one agent told me that we can only claim medical bill via whatsapp BUT i managed to claim other claims covered by the policy)   One of my most memorable claim experience was during my trip to Hakone, Japan. I bought a 2 days pass which covers the full transportation within Hakone: ferry, bus, train, cable car etc. During the first day of the trip, it was soooo unfortunate that the cable car was not working because of volcanic gaseous around the region. The exact same thing happen when we try our luck on the second day.   While on my way back to Tokyo, I've recall from the FWD travel insurance that there is a clause on travel misconnection and travel delay. Further reading to it let me realised that travel misconnection and delay is only allowed for a ""public transport operator"". This was commonly mistaken to be as only airfare.  I have decided to try my luck to claim with FWD since Cable Car was operated by a ""public transport operator"" as it met the definition. When I called in and tell them I want to claim for the travel misconnection/delay, the first question the claims department asked was to produce my air ticket. After explaining to them my situation and stating to them the clause, they asked me to send in for them to review.   I was so amazed that within 5 days, FWD adhered to their agreement in the travel insurance and paid me a cheque of $300 for the maximum benefit under travel delay ($100 for 6 hours, up to max $300). There was no hiding involved and the claim was very straightforward and easy.   Highly recommend FWD.   Pro tip: Refer your friend to get $10 for FWD new customers. The insurer also gets 5% promo. It may be good to calculate whether the 20% promo code or the $10 + 5% scheme promo code is more worth it.  "
5," FWD has also came up top on the list for the cheapest and most value for money travel insurance and my family has been purchasing their policy for the past 2 years.   Pros:  - Good UI  - Excellent customer service  - Fast claim process   Cons:  - Claim is outsourced to another company (see my story below)  - Claim may be a little long   I bought my FWD travel insurance back in December 2017 for my family trip to Norway. Unfortunately, I've accidentally dropped my camera before departure at Changi Airport(note: it is still covered in the policy as the policy covers the minute you leave home for the trip)  and sent it for repair. The camera repair shop told me that most of his customer sent in to repair.   We decided to try our luck to claim from FWD. The claims department (from another department) decided to reject our claim and giving us the reason as ""negligence"". We know that it is our fault but it defeats the purpose of the clause ""accident"".   I then went to re-read the clauses in each of the policy, taking note of the terms they used and the definition together with any general exclusion. What I found was that accident is defined as ""unintentional"", which I thought that it was just another term of ""negligence"".  My case has also not been excluded in any of the general exclusion.   I have decided to write an appeal letter to the CEO of FWD (based on what was suggested in the travel policy). To my amazed, FWD processed my claim 3 days later and told me that they will issue the cheque to my house. Around 2 weeks later, I've received the maximum payout of $300.   Lesson of the day: Please read the clauses of your travel insurance policy carefully ;) "
5,I called the FWD Insurance hotline and was served by Raj and then Marissa. Both officers were very helpful and attended to my requests efficiently. So impressed with their tip top service. Definitely a gem to the organisation. Keep it up! :) 
5,Found this insurance after googling. This is the CHEAPEST insurance anyone should get if you are going overseas. It takes less than 10 minutes to apply for the insurance. Straight-forward and easy.
5,"Fuss-free registration, and clear step-by-step instructions on the claim process. Interface is easy to use. Definitely one of the cheapest despite being an all-inclusive coverage, with the many add-on options available!"
5,"Most widely used travel insurance. Good pricing, reasonable customer service. Quick to issue travel insurance and my goto travel insurer all the time. Recommended!"
4,"Value for money, especially if you were to buy through shopback! More savings! Buy and claim processes were easy and straightforward. Good service and timely replies"
1,"I had a small incident at Korea recently.  I called the emergency hotline of FWD on my policy document.  The lady over the phone was less than helpful. I have two main issues with the process:  1) I first asked if I would incur international call charges for the call, she put me on hold for 6+mins to check on this. This is unacceptable and I cannot accept paying these charges for reasons as ridiculous as this  2) My second (main) query was to check on the definition of some terms in my policy document. She insisted that I should be speaking to the singapore ""customer service"" department instead.  Overall, I was in distress at the moment and none of my questions were answered. I ended up performing surgery back in singapore as it was unclear if I was covered for that particular procedure.  I strongly suggest all to avoid this company until they improve their services"
4,Used to buy annual plan in 2017. Speedy response to claims. Claimed medical expenses after trips. Not allowed to buy after some claims.
5,"FWD is my go to insurance whenever I travel. I have not done any claims until 2 days ago due to Travel Delay. The claim submission was done online ( Tuesday - 12/18/2018) and today ( 12/20,2018) , I already got my claim payout via PayNow.   Amazing! "
4,"Cheap, convenient and very easy to apply.  Would still be my first choice the next time Not sure how the claim's process is like though"
4,"Bought FWD Travel insurance for my recent trip to Bangkok.  Literally bought the insurance on the train, while on my way to the airport. The onboarding process and User Interface is smooth and easy on the eyes.  Price is quite reasonable too.  On top of that, I went through ShopBack and enjoyed a little bit of cashback.  "
5,Bought the annual plan. Price is competitive and claims are easy to do. Will definitely recommend it everyone. 
5,"Smooth and stress-free travel experience with unlimited medical evacuation cover, comprehensive protection and coverage, plus a click to claim process."
5,Easy to apply. Once of the more comprehensive coverage that is valued for money. Been using them for a few trips and happy knowing I'm covered 
3,"One of the cheapest plan in the market, but I personally believe is not worthy if you buy the cheap one for your travel insurance, cause my fiend last month just lost his new iPhone 10 during trip in Bangkok, however according to the coverage, the maximum he can claim is only $50. He spent $25 only for travel plan, but he regretted for his low coverage. "
5,Easy to purchase policy and they are giving additional perks. Tried to do a claim from my overseas and the payout was fast.
5,Reliable and efficient travel insurance claim!!!! Highly recommendable and easy to claim. Your one stop solution for all travel insurance needs!! 
5,Not bad good pricing easy to claim good customer service over all good experience will recommend friends
5,Like to use this insurance company! So convenient to use applying in their wedsite and fast approval too!
2,FWD is very competitive price wise but I guess they are only able to offer this because getting a claim from them is highly challenging. I used to to an advocate for them as I felt that their digital process makes things a lot more efficient. Unfortunately when I had to file a claim on behalf of my sister. I had a consistently poor claims and service experience. I do hope that they can do better. If you don't mind taking a risk on a potential claim. Go for them because of price. If not you're better off with someone else.
1,"Tried to claim their travel insurance when my car was was broken into in the US, then referred us to some AJEX Adjuster which turns out they accuse us of fraudulently submitting claims and made us sign a statutory declaration saying we won‚Äôt be allowed to claim against them ever again and shall not post the full incident on social media.   Please avoid at all cost!"
1,Bad experience with the claim for my lost of personal belongings. AJEX adjuster rejected my claim and I have to go through all over again with the fwd team. However the app fwd app is good for my medical claim in Singapore. 
5,Although only one question and Raj are very helpful during the calls and thank you for the helps. We will definitely buy it again 
5,"FWD is great! I use it everytime i travelling to oversea and I will use it again. Is not expensive, the service is good and can be easily purchase without much input."
4,"Web interface is easy to use.  Able to buy multiple trips packages instead of just one single trip.   There is also an app which can use to track your purchase.   However, unable to know it‚Äôs claiming processes because haven‚Äôt have the chance to claim."
5,Fwd is the cheapest travel insurance in the market and it has an app which you can download after purchasing the insurance plan. 
5,"Normally cheapest travel insurance for the town. I love this because I usually back Malaysia for 2-3 days. With gobexr promo, sometime only $5 for piece for mind. "
3,"Bought a single trip. Coverage seemed ok, cost ok, purchase was smooth. Didn't have to claim (thank goodness) so cannot comment on the claim process. Did everything online and no issues with the platform. "
4,FWD is the most convenient and easy as we can choose and customised what we need for our travel insurance. 
4,Found this insurance after googling. This is the CHEAPEST insurance anyone should get if you are going overseas. It takes less than 10 minutes to apply for the insurance. Straight-forward and easy.
5,"Luckily enough i never had the need to claim insurance thus far. However I just want to comment on how FWD is my go-to travel insurance company so far.   1. Fuss-free process for buying. Very easy interface and I can do it easily on my phone as well!   2. (Own opinion) one of the most value-for-money, yet comprehensive, travel insurance out there when I compare to a few others   Hope this helps! "
5,Bought my FWD travel insurance for a last-minute trip to the UK. Everything is processed fast and efficiently and I had peace of mind. Truly glad 
5,"Simple, fast and nothing complicated. I've used ntuc all my life but friends told me about FWD being one of the best. Filling up was simple, and I think if we have issues to claim later there will not be a problem. Good job! "
5,Perfect insurance company thats convinvent to purchase  Clear instructions and good after services . Highly recommended  
5,Fwd is the best travel insurance so far. Their price is competitive. They also provide different selection to meet your demand. Besides we can purchase it online which is the current trend 
5,"One of the more value for money travel insurances around and is also hassle-free to apply for! If you need peace of mind for a short getaway, fwd might be for you"
4,Always buying FWD as they often have a promo with moneysmart. Insurance coverage is decent too for the premium price.
4,Cheapest insurance and FWD Have an app FWD Flyer which is hassle free  to look at their policy detail and also visit the doctor in Singapore after their travel without paying any cash. All information can be found in the apps.. 
5,Bought their travel insurance for a trip to Indonesia and it was a fuss free procedure. Sign up easily in 5min
4,"Fwd insurance buying process was easy and with the app that is introduced, things are much easier! Would buy it again when I go overseas."
5,FWD has one of the most affordable travel insurance and the claiming process is really easy! :) highly recommend!
4,Value for money if buying annual travel insurance for couple without kids. Best to renew plan as new customer when there is promotion whereby discount and vouchers are given. 
4,"Quick and efficient way of buying insurance. However, do read the tnc well , doesn‚Äôt not effect on the same day of purchase "
4,"My purchasing process for FWD was really smooth. However, i can't really comment too much as I have not have had a chance to use it. The person working with me, Giselle, was quite patient and really took the time to explain to me everything. Will be continuing usage. "
5,The cheapest travel insurance usually whenever I‚Äôm considering to buy when I go overseas. I used to claim because I went to see doctor after I came back for a long trip. It took about 2-3 months before I got the claim back so I think it‚Äôs still alright! 
5,The travel insurance is cheap and always worth having for students like me who love short trips with friends and family! 
5,Cheap and value for money. I've submitted my claims for damage baggage and got my payout within 24 hours. Will continue to buy from FWD. 
5,I like the FWD travel insurance. The entire pre sales and post sales process is transparent and hassle free. I have been purchasing their annual travel insurance for the past two years and so far I am happy with it so far. 
5,Top choice for travel insurance. Good price and easy to purchase. Benefits clearly stated. Very highly recommended! 
5,Was made a comparison with all the other insurer and found out FWD is the cheapest among all the insurer for 250 k medical coverage. Application process very fast and easy too.

5,"Easy to use UI and affordable. I have been purchasing FWD travel insurance for my past overseas trips. Have not encountered any issue so far. To save more, buy through Shopback!

5,Application process is really fast. I got it within 5min and the coverage and pricing is competitive.
5,"FWD insurance is pretty good considering the price you can get it, with the discounts they are giving. I bought recently on my trip to Malaysia without much hassle 1 day before my trip. I have also used FWD a few times before that, including my long trip to Europe back in 2017 as well.   All in all, the experience has been pretty good. I have not used their claims yet so I can't mention anything about that yet."
5,Bought an annual insurance policy from FWD. Cheapest one available out there as there is always promo code.
5,Bought their travel insurance recently. Although I never made a claim from them but I need to edit my particular which I require their assistance from them. Their customer service is fast & wonderful!
4,Fuss free. Took a while for the flight delay claims to get through. But nonetheless still manage to get the full claimable amount.

4,"Fwd has been my go to travel insurance ever since a Friend introduced me to it. It‚Äôs the lowest price in the market and absolutely fuss free. Although I haven‚Äôt encountered any mishaps in my travels, I am relieved to know that I have insurance to fall back on in case of anything. "
5,competitive premiums and super easy to navigate website for travel insurance purchases. yet to make a claim. also the mobile app is another plus point.
5,One of the cheapest travel insurance out there especially with the 5 dollar referral discount. Claims were smooth and easy as well 
3,have been purchasing their insurance for the past few travel trips. They have a really good interactive website to buy from but reading the reviews on their claim process has cautioned me and probably influenced me to try other travel insurance products in future.
5,Easy to purchase and very value for money because it's one of the cheapest options. It's suitable for short trips! 
4,"So far no bad experiences, claims are also quite smooth as long as you got the necessary documents. Competitive prices and easy to navigate their site."
5,My traveling companion got a sprained just before the trip and we checked with FWD on what should be done for claims. The claims were paylah to me just one day after submission of claims! So fuss-free and efficient! 
5,"Good product and fuss free purchase thur the website, come with cash back thru shopback too:) will post if have claim process, hopefully not:) "
3,I was able to get quote fast and easily from them and able to put my trust into them as a huge and reliable company. However their service has to improve! 
5,"I typically buy my insurance from them cause the prices are really competitive, and their claims process for one of my previous trips (medical bills in sg) was quite smooth and easy! Go through third party websites (e.g. moneysmart) to get additional discounts! Look out for FWD's frequent promotions too which they do run quite regularly"
5,Very easy to use website with straightforward plans and competitive prices. Had to file a claim once and overall the process was rather hasslefree. No complaints. 
5,FWD is so far so good for me. I think i need to make more purchases. I haven made any claims before yet.
5,"Bought the FWD insurance for 3 pax for my recent trip to Greece in June 2019. Buying process was easy and fuss-free, purchase was done within minutes. Value for money as well. "
5,Will recommend. Cheap and affordable with good coverage. Easy to buy hassle free. Will recommend to friend
3,"So far so good. As they were new last time (not now), so the travel insurance purchase process was easy (via website), then happens to have claims via (app), so it was quite seamless.  However, as my case was due to travel delay but they 6 hours block each, so get back very little not as what I thought it would be. Furthermore if is travel delay, even though there's other incident involve during the delayed process, I cannot claim on those such as luggage misplace /missing, other similar situations,   All in all , need to read the fine prints and knows it well so that we'll know what we get.  P/S: As now the issue of travel incidents happens more frequently , due to more people travel frequently, so they have increase their premium. No long has any advantage over others other than more tech savvy with apps to claim easier only."
5,This gave me the confidencr and assurance to really relaxing and not worrying about the stuff that might ruin the mood. There was also a storm warning at that time in Thailand so this couldn't have come at a better time  
5,I've been buying FWD Travel Insurance every time I travel overseas on holiday. Sign up is easy and fuss free and their web interface is simple as well. Signing up takes less than 5 mins. Can't comment much about claiming as I've never found the need to make a claim yet!
4,Fuss free purchase online. Received information on policy and emergency contact through email and SMS
5,"FWD's prices are pretty much the cheapest in the market, and the claim process was surprisingly fast.  Within 2 days of my claim submission (for phone theft), I received an email that my claim was approved and they sent a cheque of $500 (the max amount for a single item, under the middle tier - business) the next week.   Other details: This was in Feb 2017. My phone was about 1 year old, and original value was slightly over 1k. I was able to provide all required documents such as police report and invoice of the stolen item (thankfully I kept it! It was in the form of a service agreement with my telco, as I had bought my phone bundled under contract)  I have also made medical claim before for a separate trip, but that was pretty straightforward (just the GP receipt, small amount) and also received the payment quite quickly.  I haven't experienced any bad service thus far, but could be because my claims are not contentious and quite straightforward. Not too sure if the claim would be so smooth for less straightforward cases which may require more detailed investigations due to bigger amounts being claimed."
4,"Bought travel insurance a couple months ago for my recent trip to Switzerland. Got a 18% discount if I recall correctly. Nothing went wrong so no claims needed.  A tip regarding the research and purchase process though. Sometimes FWD has promotions, and you may be given the option to key in a promo code before prices are quoted to you. Strangely, the option to key in promo code doesn't always appear. Not sure why. I simply closed and reopened the website multiple times to try to get the page where they give me the option to key in promo code"
5,"I have only started applying FWD travel last year after watching their TV advertisement. I found out that their premium rates were cheaper compared to others. Secondly, their claim process were easy and simple to navigate. Finally, if you have any issues or questions, you can interact with them as and when you available. So, who will resists such great deals?"
5,Easy and convenient to apply and get the travel policy done. Good and easy to use. Not so complex type
4,Fuss-free payments and simple to understand travel insurance coverage! One of my preferred choice always.
5,Cheap and good! I bought an annual insurance and the claim process was very efficient. Highly recommend
3,"Just got my annual plan: interface was a breeze to use, and customer service was good and clear. hope there‚Äôs no need to claim anything; otherwise, hope claims will be fuss free"
5,"I was searching for a travel insurance that provides the best value in terms of premium payable and coverage for my graduation trip to Taiwan for 2 weeks in March earlier this year. After some comparison, I decided to go for FWD's travel insurance Premium plan.   Overall, the process of purchasing the travel insurance to making my medical claim was pretty smooth and hassle-free. I used a promo code upon checking out and only had a pay a premium of $30.24. Shortly after, they sent over the insurance policy via email and created an account for me so that I can view the policy and make claims (if needed) through their website.   During the last few days of my trip, I was down with sore throat and cough. So the next day after I returned to Singapore, I visited a doctor as according to the policy, I had to do so before 48 hours in order to be eligible for the claim. I then proceeded to make a medical claim under the travel insurance for my upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) online. After doing so, I mailed the physical medical receipt to their claims department. About a week after, I received the amount I paid for consulting the doctor through bank transfer.   All in all, I highly recommend FWD and would definitely use it again! "
4,One of the cheapest travel insurance around and my claim experience with them last year was hassle free.
5,"Very good experience with FWD insurance as i realized it is one of the cheapest travel insurance around! (i use Gobear to do my comparison). Recently, I had to do a travel claim with them and I got my reimbursement within 2 months - which is really fast as compared to some of the examples I heard from my friends with other insurance companies!"
5,"I always use FWD for my travels, as its simple and no frills. Haven't had the opportunity to try a claim though, but thats fortunate i suppose."
4,"Well, 4 star because I have all the good things to say about fwd travel insurance, but I just lack the claims experience.   Easy to buy and convenient to buy. Often bought it on the travellator towards the check in gates in Changi airport.  Fast game"
4,"Bought the FWD travel insurance before my trip to Europe and was not feeling well on the last day of the trip, so I went to see the doctor the next day after arrival (which was within the ""48 hours"" time frame, and submitted my claim online and it took around 2 weeks to get my claim which was directly deposited to my bank account. The whole procedure was easy and smooth, they also apologized for the late payment due to peak season. Overall I was quite impressed with the service and the premium is much lower compared to other insurance companies. "
5,"Bought single trip travel insurance online for the whole family to guangzhou early this year. Payment is easy and fuss free. During the 2nd last day of our trip, 3 of us got food poisioning. Torturous, during the flight back to singapore! Visited the doctor the next day, submitted the claims online. Everything was done online, and we got our reimbursement within the next week. Recommended!"
4,I have been getting per trip travel insurance from FWD as they are one of the cheapest on the market. Things that I like  1) periodic discounts on insurance  2) fuss free  3) easy application on mobile or any computing platform   This year I decided to take up and annual travel insurance as there was a 20 % in apr with a free EZ card(yet to receive) but I think the proof of the pudding would be in the event that I needed to make a claim which I have not done.
5,"I bought it a few months ago during my overseas trip and i was searching for a affordable solution when i came across this site, policies were pretty easy to understand, price was much much better then the rest as well !! The entire process was smooth and after buying i received confirmation emails and the necessary details of the policy, I have not claimed anything from them before so i cant judge on its claims process. "
5,"This is my second time buying FWD travel insurance. Both experiences purchasing FWD were good: premiums are very affordable, and the policy is straightforward and easy to read. My most recent trip was a dive trip and I was pleasantly surprised that FWD covered activities like diving (less than 30 m), while still maintaining an affordable premium. I claimed for medical expenses incurred in Singapore and the online process was fast with a simple, user-friendly interface. Haven't received my claim yet as I've only just submitted it, but so far the experience with FWD has been good!"
5,"I was researching for an annual travel insurance plan late last year and was referred to FWD for consideration. I definitely like the competitive pricing FWD was able to offer. However as I had to make a quick decision then and was also considering a similar travel insurance plan to cover my ageing mother who also had stroke and some other illness, I was not able to find one that meet my family need and eventually did not buy from FWD. However having been introduced to FWD now, this will be one company that i will seriously consider for my future travel need.  This is just my honest feedback given that I did not sign up with FWD then."
5,"Bought FWD travel insurance online for a last minute trip to Bangkok. The purchase was very easy and convenient, and I was covered in a few minutes time! There was no hiccups for the trip, hence unable to comment about their claim process. Will buy again for my next travel due to its competitive pricing and ease of purchase"
5,"I am always buying my travel insurance at the last minute. Hence, I love using FWD insurance because the website is very user friendly which makes purchasing travel insurance fuss-free and affordable.  I was able to get a value for money and ideal travel insurance for my holiday or overseas vacations.  The price offered is very competitive and it allows me to compare the options and benefits between the different companies. "
5,FWD Insurance has an easy interface and low premiums thanks to the promo codes. It also has one of the most comprehensive coverage. I can call the customer service hotline if I have any questions and they are always happy to help. Claim process is easy and simple as it can be done via whatsapp or online.
5,I love using FWD insurance because the website is user friendly which makes purchasing travel insurance easy and simple The online purchase was fast and simple. I love their promo codes and the cheaper premium rates were cheaper compared to others. I also like that they have a hotline so that I can reached them easily and they were very polite and friendly.  
5,glad that the travel insurance for Korea trip 2017 helped to cover the broken luggaage incurred :) The claim was fuss-free and speedy 
5,FWD Travel insurance gives me a peace of mind and the price is reasonable ! No hidden cost and very transparent! Highly recommended 
4,"I bought FWD travel insurance, the price are definitely lower  compared to other insurers and have decent coverage."
4,I bought a 3-year endowment plan from FWD that offers me a guaranteed return of 2.02% per annum. This was the first time I buy insurance online and I was worried it would be a daunting task but the process was easy and fast. The short term commitment and capital guaranteed suits my needs very well. 
5,I bought FWD travel insurance for one of my trips and I must say the process of screening for the insurance I want and buying it is a breeze because the website is user friendly and intuitive. The The prices are lower compared to other insurers because there are usually ongoing promotions and discounts. Benefits are comparable to many other insurers. I love that FWD makes insurance simple and easy. Two thumbs up!! =)    
5,"FWD has one of the most comprehensive coverage and cheapest across the board. The promotion codes are another bonus when signing up for their plans at a discount. I find that FWD travel insurance a lifesaver when  I have the unfortunate experience of missing my connection, cancelled or delayed flight and lost/delay luggage. FWD will get me covered so that I have the funds (ranging from $200 to $500) to make alternative arrangement. "
5,"Premiums are affordable for the amount of coverage.  Got FWD Travel insurance in March 2017.  Experienced an unfortunate accident during the trip, When I came back to Singapore, I contacted their service hotline and was advised about the claim process. The customer service side just needed me to submit the docs. I submitted them on 7th April 2017, and got the successful reply from them on 25th April 2017. And got my cheque in my mailbox about 5 days later. Smooth claim process. Full claim process.  Since my experience was great with FWD, I decided to get from them again in March 2018. Thank God, I had a safe trip and nothing to claim. Highly recommended! "
5,Bought FWD travel insurance for two of my trips. The pricing is lower compared to other insurers and there‚Äôs usually discount for their plans. Benefits are comparable to many other insurers. Yet to claim anything but before switching to FWD I was using NTUC Income claimed for medical reimbursement for medical bills. The process was troublesome as you have to print out the documents mail everything out and the risk of it losing in the mail. It also took them almost a month to just process my $50 claim. Then on I decided to look for the next affordable insurer and chance upon FWD.  
4,"Bought a Travel Insurance from them. Easy interface, cheap premium, with direct discounts instead of going through a third party. Insurance should always be this simple."
5,"Bought FWD travel insurance before. Price is really cheaper to other competitors, coverage is also good. Will definitely recommend FWD"
5,Bought travel insurance to Japan in 2017. Thankfully nothing happened so I did not have to do anything. Buying process was smooth and they offered good value for money with their travel insurance policy. 
4,Bought twice from FWD before for my travel insurance. Fast and fuss free purchase online. I called their hotline once to verify something on their terms and conditions and received a fast and professional reply. Will recommend them as their price is also very competitive
5,"Attractive price and very easy to buy. On my last trip, we bought travel insurance for 2 while waiting to board our plane at Changi Airport! Had a corporate discount so the price was even more attractive.   Haven't claimed before, but now that I'm in the process of a complicated claim by another provider which i got annual travel issuance from and I'm seeing all these reviews mentioning convenient claims from FWD, i may consider getting myself some extra protection from FWD for my future trips."
5,"Love the fact that I can purchase travel insurance directly online. The claiming process for travel insurance can be easily done via WhatsApp or simply online. In fact, this is a great feature as I can act on it (buying or claiming) at any hour of the day that I am free to do so."
4,"I bought travel insurance while waiting to board the plane, and navigating the webpage on my phone was a cinch (though pages are not resized for mobile view). I‚Äôd heard of their promo codes so did a quick google search, found one for 20% off, and applied that immediately.   No experience with claims!"
4,"Last year during December holidays, I bought this travel insurance plan from FWD online. It covers your personal accident or health related issues. Furthermore, it comes at an affordable rate. It's not a yearly premium or monthly premium, you can purchase as and when you preferred. Compared to the other insurance company, this would be the best for me as customer service is an important aspect for me. I can reached them easily and they were very polite and friendly. Therefore, I strongly recommended to those who wanted to buy a travel insurance scheme."
5,"FWD.. Fast, Worthy, Determined. Even though they might be new in the market going against big boys they had no lack of passion in their customer service.   Calling them was never an issue, prompt, precise and detailed. Knowledgeable staff who will actually get back to you within the day because I was desperately trying to renew my car insurance to renew my road tax and they managed to settled my policy in 15mins. Unlike other vendors who will play hard to get and reply you via WhatsApp instead of dropping a call as promised.  Their prices and promotions are as promised, no officers trying to pull sales by remembering your name or contact number. No matter how big or small your policy or enquiry they treat you with the same amount of effort. Easiest insurance policy forms, no retarded questions on the website.   Truth was I was also skeptical about them when i was doing my research , cause ""new"" but after a few calls and some questions.. I guess my car will be with them for another 10 years!"
4,"Bought FWD travel insurance for my recent trip to Europe in Mar'18. Nothing bad happened during my trip so I didn't have to claim! Whew!  So honestly I don't know how their claims process are like.  What I like about FWD is that their prices are either the lowest or second lowest in the market. Good coverage for that piece of mind and affordable so that there's no big hole in your travel budget.  Their UI/UX is great also, very easy to click and select the options and checking it out is a breeze!"
4,"Bought the insurance (FWD premium) for my recent trip to Australia, after finding out from Seedly.sg that credit card that offer insurance is not adequate.  Price: 4.5/5  Travel inconvenience coverage: 4/5  Travel cancellation due to travel Agency not covered, but nowadays how many people fly with tour agency?  Medical coverage: 5/5 I can actually claim treatment by Chinese physician or chiropractor!  Others: ?/5 (Rental vehicle excess, rental vehicle return, pet care and etc not covered) Not my concern, so I did not rate this."
5,"Bought it because it was cheap and had decent coverage when I went to Vietnam. When I came back I visited a doctor within 48 hours as required.   I submitted the claims online quite easily. Upon submission the website told me to mail the hardcopy receipt to them. However, in the email acknowledgement they told me they would contact me if more documents were required.   I did not mail the hardcopy, and 10 days later they asked me for bank statement because I opted for bank transfer. I emailed back the next day and I got my claim success notification about 3 weeks later.   Submitted claim 9 Jan Received cash ~12 Feb "
1,"The problem of buying direct is that we have to settle all appealing by ourselves.  My friend bought AIA travel plan and I gotten FWD. There was a baggage delay. Just 12 mins difference, AIA closed one eye and paid full benefit. FWD insisted not.  Many rounds of appealing and they finally agreed to pay.   Very painful experience! Higher premium policy always have a reason for it and cheap policy too!  "
4,"I get started on FWD end of last year, after failing to claim from a complimentary free insurance (credit card). I did some comparison on type of coverage, amount claimable with a few companies. This comes to be top of my list.  Coincidentally for that trip, I need to make a claim for travel delay.   Pro:  - really easy, just need to watsapp the pic of document OR attach to online platform, (instead of filing lots of forms, mailing this and that) I do not know if it's the same ease for other portion of travel claims though. - cheque was received within a month  Con: - none so far  I have been choosing FWD since then. They have frequent good promotion too, to make the premium cheaper."
4,"I usually purchase FWD for travel insurance as they are usually affordable and offer decent coverage.  Pros: - User friendly website - Decent coverage at affordable price  Cons: - Long claim process - Fine prints (as with any other insurance policy, take caution when reading the terms and conditions)"
4,"I have been buying FWD for the past 2 years now for every single one of my trips. Mainly because the deals for travel insurance value are actually quite decent. So far, I had 2 successful claims with FWD (but with some issues faced on the second claim which I was quite shocked with... I lost a phone via a pickpocket in Indonesia but after about a 1 month claim process, they actually offered me only $50 as compensation. I realised it was in the policy wording that it was due to the depreciation of the product and it was capped at only $50 because I had no receipt of my iPhone which was bought around 2 years back.  Pros: - Very good website and experience one of the best - For both applying and claim process, uploading of files and documents - It was easily downloadable and easy to access while on the trip itself (for me it was via email in Indonesia)  Cons: - The claims process was actually outsourced to another company to handle - It could have been better as the process took some time... - The policy wording summary was actually not very complete... you need to really read the fine prints to understand your full coverage!"
5,Claim process from a recent accident had been smooth. Customer call centre can help with the problem mentioned speedily. 
4,"Pros: Course was really easy to understand (disclaimer being that I do have some accounting background which helped). They taught us easily applied methods to identify value stocks. In my opinion, it‚Äôs a good course to attend as it would save you a lot of time figuring out a sound investment strategy.   Cons: Too much advertising and in my opinion,  there were too many examples for day two of the course (a bit draggy).  PS: Not gonna lie but I wrote this review cause they were giving out two free books for writing a review. "
5,"Disclaimer: I got a sponsored for a seat through a contest by Seedly however this has no bearing on the review of the course.  Course attended: REITs Investing Mastery Course (RIMC)  Pros  - coverage of basic concepts  - simply explaination of technical concepts  - Assestments for applying concepts learn - use cases  - Good knowledge of instructor   Cons  - location was a little hard to find  - seats were a little cramp  - expert investors might find it too basic   In Summary A good course that enables new investors to understand what are REITS and trusts, how they work and how to do basics of analysis. The cost might seem high but it really helps to have someone with the knowledge to walk you through rather than trying to figure everything out on your own.  For experienced investors the basic concepts might be a little boring but personally I felt that I helps cover the entire band from current investors to newbies.   I have invested in REITS however I did not have the insights on how to evaluate if there are truely good. What i did before was to look at dividends only. The course has helped me with a framework on how to do analysis before my next purchase.  Worth it !  "
5,Chris teaches cryptocurrency investing in concise and easily understandable manner. Very good course to learn basics of this new product before investing. 
5,Thanks for Dr. Wealth for recommending Cryptocurrency course to me. I have learnt a lot about Cryptocurrency. 
4,"Attended a sponsored REITs course from Seedly. Won from the contest.   The REITs course offered by Dr Wealth is definitely informative. Filled up the missing gaps that I've self learnt from REITs books. Being a 4 hour course, they are able to cover up the basic fundamental of REITs. Would appreciate if they also added in the risk profile/volatility of different industry REITs since it's a fundamental to know and let individual investors decides based on their risk profile.   Based on Dr Wealth course website, this course is valued at $365 and a early bird discount valuing at $128 if i remembered it correctly.  Definitely recommend it to investors that wants to start investing/ learn more about REITs. "
5,I attended the REITS course which was sponsored by Seedly. I would highly recommend to beginners who want to learn more about REITS. The speaker is a very experienced lecturer and has offered many insights about the REITS industry. It is definitely informative and it is very well paced. I believe anyone who attends the course would definitely find it useful. Thanks Seedly! 
4,"Disclaimer: Attended REITS course that I won from seedly contest so ticket is free.  REITS course was half day course. I checked the pricing is about $365. For a half day course the content was well covered and sufficient.   I am an intermediate investor level but I still learnt alot from this course. Definitely will recommend for absolute beginners.   The course covered from What is a REIT, how to evaluate a REIT, the risks involved, pros and cons of REITS, types of REIT, how to analyse good or bad REITs.  A must go for beginners because it is extremely value for money. Other courses out in the market would easily cost $1k +++ (I have been to those expensive courses).   One not so good point is the venue may be abit hard to find. And I would also suggest there be a ""Advanced level"" course for REITS going more in-depth than this course.   Oh and if you are wondering, there is no Hard selling of anything after the course, no software, no special add-ons for $xxx"
5,"Attended the Cryptoknight Armor Series with Chris and gain much more..Not only i start to understand what the hype is about, I also can start to participate in the game. Chris is very approachable and willing to answer all the questions that we have. I feel he is willing to share not like others that share a bit and keep more to himself. Best part is the support system after course ended which really give me more confidence to start the journey. "
5,"Attended the REITs course with our Seedly top contributors and I must say I have never paid attention for such an extended period of time until this course came along. Our speaker Mr Ong did a great job taking us from zero REITs knowledge to a rather intermediate level of understanding, along with a succinct booklet of notes. Highly reccommended!"
4,I like the structured tools shared which allows me to make decisions more objectively. Trainers teach from experience with case studies to aid understanding and the tools can immediately be applied. Thanks to the training team!
5,The course is really useful for a beginner with zero knowledge in stocks trading. Clear explaination with real life example where beginner can understand better. Content-packed and the class always start sharp on time! 
5,"I attended their Factor Based Investing Course (FBIC) which is their flagship course for budding investors. The concepts taught can't be easily found in any or a single investing book (that would defeat the purpose of paying for a course, wouldn't it?) and Dr Wealth tends to also come up with their own formula and metrics, which I appreciate as that is entirely new content that you'll be hard-pressed to find anywhere else!   In terms of difficulty level, I would say this would be great for any investor of ALL levels - and even better if you're a total beginner because then you'll really be starting off with a strong foundation.  Full review here: http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2018/08/dr-wealth-factor-based-investing-course.html "
4,"I went for two courses!  First one is the  Personal finance fundamentals by Louis. It was really good and i learnt a ton of basics and also not mant people know but a good deal of bonds also was covered. Was not sold anythig during the course and for $100+ it was really valuable knowledge :) highly recommended for begineers wanting to get your stuff together.  Second one is the REITS basics course. Also very good! We went together with our moderators and what we found was a very good and basic understanding into REITs and thereafter, given a scorecard into analysing REITs. Thereafter, I actually went to buy my first two REITs from the course and actually yielding between 6-7% p.a now. Not bad! :)  I reserved one star because I have not yet attended their flagship course yet - factor based investing. Maybe one day soon :) that one is alot more pricey at $1-2k if i rmb correctly. But having been to his preview lesson, should be good stuff! Haha  As a whole DrWealth has a group of committed no-frills instructors who i think are legit people all round."
4,Attended Sept batch of i3 program. I find the course easy enough to understand and most importantly impart me a quantitative method to invest in stocks and generate better returns   Looking forward to join the community to learn and exchange ideas 
5,"I am quite new to investing, and I appreciated the way that Alvin and Louis presented a systematic process in approaching investments. The hands-on sessions backed up with theory were important in getting us to understand the decision-making process when evaluating stocks, and I also liked the focus on analysing fundamentals of companies and businesses.   The sessions have been fruitful thus far, and the materials provided helped to supplement the learning. I would recommend this course because it provides a clear actionable path forward, and helps to take quite a bit of emotions out of the investment process."
5,"I3 course negotiated me through the mumbo jumbo of world of equities investment, with fundamentals, theories and concepts explained in clear and layman format.   The factor based strategies are orthodox, methodical and easy to apply. I can‚Äôt wait to test them out, and build up new investing discipline to reap sweet fruits of $$!"
5,Highly recommended course. Louis and Alvin are able to explain the concepts to their investing strategy using various easy to understand concept. Even a new investor like me is able to grasp it. Big thank you to the team at Dr Wealth for helping me to start my investment journey.
5,"Perhaps the most sensible, evidenced, and ultra in-depth analytic method to investing. The trainers are extremely experienced, knowledgeable, yet sincere to share their secrets. Their methods are so finely and deeply thought out. But perhaps most valuable is with their method, packaged along with a screener to suss out only the cream of the crop stocks you should look at. Definitely a must attend if u are a serious investor"
4,"This is a resourceful, practical and intuitive investment course to attend.  The course not only teaches useful and easy to understand investment strategies, it also provides relevant information and uses real life examples for attendees.  Questions and queries from the floor were all answer during the entire course.  Value for money!"
5,"Despite being fairly well exposed to financial knowledge, I consider myself a novice when it comes to stock investing. It wasn't until circa. June 2019 that it dawned on me that the following two things were missing in my investment agenda:  1) A trading system, especially a highly executable analytical framework which tells me precisely and concisely which stocks to buy and why (both from a qualitative and quantitative perspective) and when when to exit;   2) A like-minded trader community which focuses on fundamental analysis.  Despite the pretty handsome fees for the i3 course, if you are also in search for the two items above, it is a price worth paying. Arguably, one could figure out a fundamental-based trading system just through patient and thorough reading of the fundamental analysis (""FA"") literature which is widely available. I beg to differ that a lot of books on FA out there, whilst brimming with wise advice, those advice come too general. Also, lets face it, the FA literature has been lacking in instructional guides which could inspire readers to take immediate action.   I personally feel Dr Wealth has done the FA community and believers in FA a great service by plugging the gap. Having said the above, I believe the real value gems are Alvin and Louis themselves. Surprisingly enough, both of them come across as down to earth folks, which are extremely rare in the bubbly retail investor community, where people (and especially trainers) are fist/chest pumping and cheerleading too much.  Personally, I was very much assured by Alvin's equanimous and matter-of-factedly attitude when he was conducting classes. He definitely knows his material inside out (evident from how he never brushed over any questions and always answers comprehensively), and appeared to be always calm and not easily excitable, which again, is hard to find in today's society.  Whilst folks who are well versed with financial and investing knowledge might find the i3 course rudimentary, nevertheless, if you have been searching for a highly actionable FA framework, and looking to acquaint yourself with practical tutors in Alvin and Louis, why not keep an open mind, attend this course, and put in the hard work afterwards with much more clarity and confidence.  (Quick note: If you are a technical analysis junkie, this might not be a course for you)."
5,"The course is founded and supported by proven scientific research. I have attended such courses before and were very subjective.  I greatly appreciate Alvin and Louis who have approached investing in a systematic and scientific way, clear and have provided excellent business knowledge to understand the details of the f√¨nanical report.  I have learned and enjoyed the class thoroughly. Thanks Alvin and Louis."
5,I put off attending this course for six months and now deeply regret the time lost. Several practical strategies are explained in a very clear and concise way that is accessible to everyone even if you have no previous experience of financial statements. Strategies for portfolio management to minimise your risk while maximising returns and ongoing support for future investment are splendid. 
5,"Just like all of y'all out there looking at reviews with a pinch of salt, I joined the course on my own with doubt.  Quite a lot of doubt. But after I went through the lessons and learn the values and fundamentals I believe everyone who is a beginner should learn this systemic framework. Treat the course as an investment that is worth your time. Great course"
5,"If you are a smart consumer and wants to become smart investor, i3 course is for you. I was looking for smart people like Alvin who knows how to discern good from bad and found him. Louis is also smart but he has to bias and he is open about it. The whole team is very helpful including Xing Hui, May and one more team member."
5,I attended Dr Wealth's I3 course.  Alvin and the Louis are highly knowlegeable and are able to make complex investment concepts simple to understand.
5,Methods taught were easy to understand and apply. Trainers were friendly and always willing to help answer any difficulties faced by students
5,The I3 course has provided me with clear investment strategies that are easy to follow and understand. 
5,"Course attended: Intelligent Investor Immersive Program.  Course insightful and instructors are very knowlegable. For serious stock investors, highly recommended you attend the program. "
5,"I attended the Intelligent Investor Immersive Programme (I3) and definitely learnt a lot.   I'm a beginner investor with no prior knowledge whatsoever and I found the course easy to understand. Alvin and Louis were approachable and patient. Using analogies and real examples to illustrate the concepts taught really helped accelerate my learning curve. The course teaches 2 different strategies for picking stocks. I liked that the strategies have a strong logical basis for a long term approach to investing. The instructors took pains to explain why and how the strategies worked. I also learnt a lot about the mechanics of the market.  I would definitely recommend this course to beginners and experienced investors alike. While the cost might seem a little steep, I found it worth every dollar. Definitely a good investment in myself!"
4,Chris is patient with us as most of us have no or little knowledge of crypto currency. He explained with practical example for easy to understand. He also got his facilitator to assist each one of us.

5,"Unselfish sharing and giving. Lots of good information. Amazing course, amazing community, amazing trainers! A great place to start your Crypto journey!"

5,Great crypto beginner class that covers both theoretical and practical excercises to ensure its well grasped. Good sharing of best practices and inclusion into a long term coaching community. Made my first $100 in the first day (invested $300).
5,Attended the CryptoKnight Course in July 2019. Very clear and step-by-step help to getting into crypto buying/selling. 
4,Writes insightful article on wealth. Perhaps having a better layout of the article would help. Overall it‚Äôs a good website for financial knowledge 
4,Good writeup by the author who is knowledge on how to increase our wealth. I find some of the articles insightful and worth reading 
5,Attended the masterclass preview and signed up for the masterclass. Great class organised by organiser. Would like them to offer more beginner class!
5,The course is informative and easy to understand. The trainers made it interactive. It covers both quantitative and qualitative elements but skewed towards quantitative evaluation
4,"Alvin is passionate and knowledgeable. He presents and systematic way of stock screening that is easy to apply. He makes use of many free tools that are easily available to people like you and I. Crucial points are summarized succinctly so that it is easy to remember. In short the framework is simple, balanced and sustainable. "
4,The course was easy and simple to understand. There were lots of case studies which could help to digest the content easily. :)
5,"A systematic approach to finding, selecting undervalued stocks and also when to sell. Easy to understand and to invest like a business owner. "
4,Factor Based Investing Course was really interesting because despite having an accounting background i used to overthink and overcomplicate things. This hence made me hesitant to invest. Even hough the course is intensive and may feel mentally draining the methods are quite useful to use by thenselves or build upon them by yourself.
5,High ideas made simple. Lessons were well thought out and examples were suitable. Would highly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to have a disciplined way of looking at the market.
4,"The FBIC is structured to help participants understand and logically approach stock selections. Great for beginners who do not have a strategy with regard to active investing yet. Administratively well managed, timely reminders and organized at good location. "
5,"I've attended the factor based investing course.  The course is very well organized and packed full of useful and practical information. By the end of the first day, even a total beginner like me am able to read financial statements and evaluate stocks based on the metrics given.  The trainers are very knowledgeable and teach with examples which I find effective. They are also very generous with their tips to give you the most efficient (and smart) way to go about investing.   They go beyond just giving you formula but also explain the concept behind the metrics which is so much more beneficial to me as I now understand the why and not just the how. This gives me more faith in the metrics.  Highly recommended for any beginners like me!  "
5,"Great course for beginners to start investing. For someone who doesn‚Äôt have background in investing, this is really helpful. Learnt so much!"
5,Awesome investment course ! Everything made simple and given thorough explanation. Great course for beginners like me to start investing. 
5,course was systematic and instructors made it easy for us to understand. would recommend this to my friends 
5,"As a beginner, learning is the most important factor before start investing. Learning of CNAV strategy is the fundamental or systematic for person who don‚Äôt know how to start. "
5,"Value based investing. This course is simple and easy to follow. Just simple rules to investing. Both Alvin n Louis are good instructors, always there to answer queries of the class. Would def recommend pple who wants a simple way of investing to join this seminar. "
5,"Overall, the course provides a very systematic approach to stock investing. For anyone still depending on stock tips on investing, this course is effective in teaching you the basics of Fundamental Analysis and gives you some structure on your investment journey.  However, Dr Wealth's team was more hesitant in sharing what are some of their failures. What are some stocks that passed all their factors in their Factor Based Investing but still fell in price and why? Perhaps a key part of their strategy is: I will hold 10 stocks, and even if 5 stocks turn out to be not profitable, the other 5 stocks can make up for it.  Ultimately, for an intermediate investor, Dr Wealth's approach may not be very intuitive. Nonetheless, I have learnt quite a bit from this course and feel that this is worth the price paid (mainly patching holes in my understanding and setting up a system for stock buying, monitoring and selling).  Background: I have 1 year of investing experience and some knowledge in accounting and finance before attending this course. I paid $1,xxx for the course. "
5,Clear and effective teaching of what made Warren Buffett rich in his early days of investing. Methodology of investment is backed by successful investors who want a margin of safety. The course trainers encourage participants to ask as much questions to clarify any doubts. Highly recommended if you want to learn about true value-investing.
5,I was very impressed with the dish to earth and simple way of communicating important financial concepts as relevant to investing. For new comers this is very important.  For experienced persons it‚Äôs a refreshing review of fundamentals for share investments. 
5,Thanks and appreciation to Alvin and Louis . Both of them presented factor based investing course very well . Look like they are very strait forward to the point of how the new comets able to make money through this valyable course . Cheer for them and excellent in stock markets as as gurus.
5,It's a perfect way of learning how to analyze companies to invest in their stocks rather than going through trial and error. In which can be quite risky
5,Very structured and step by step explained to us. Definitely recommended if you need an investment strategy! Thanks Alvin and Louis.
5,"The course is well structured and straight to the point and saves newbie investor like myself times so that we do not go in circles. The quantitative analysis taught instead of the usual qualitative analysis also tell a more comprehensive picture of the company and more importantly, Alvin and Louis taught a skill which is scalable in the future."
4,This course is really engaging by the Instructors and it is a really good experience to gain these knowledge.  I hope to learn more from their investing journey.
5,Alvin and Louis did a great explanation on CNAV concept to look for undervalue stocks and GPAD concept to look for dividend and growth stocks. Highly recommend this factor based investing course for all stocks investors as it simplified your stocks screening and selection criretias to find the right stocks for your investment.
5,"Alvin and Louis trained Fundamental base Analysis. Filter out with screener what you want to analysis, for growth stock or value stock  then check quality of those companies, management, positive cash flow, sound return and company sustainability .  If companies meet those parameters, then only start to calculate how much to pay. You get your offer price vs market price because you know the valve of company. How much can get it with discount from market? If there is intrinsic valve, then choose it. To easy to pick up key elements from Annual Report.  Good things for me is easy to get my offer price to market and save time. Only 15 minutes to make decision to buy or not. Deeper understanding of financial terms is depends on your background knowledge and future learning. Thanks Alvin and Louis"
5,Alvin and Louis simplified investing through their factor-based investing course. It provides a more systematic approach towards choosing undervalued stocks as well as potential growth stocks.
5,The course provides a systematic approach to factor based investing that value adds to the open content available on their website. The sessions were engaging and the trainers are very willing to share their knowledge.
5,"Great course with genuine coaches who practice what they preach and have ""skin in the game"". Highly recommended"
4,"Came for this course because i was keen on building systematic perspectives in investing, and the course offered not only that, but also actionable and replicable processes  to do so. What i also liked was how Alvin goes into the rationale and underlying thought behind why things are done a certain way. Only leaving it at 4 stars for now because i've yet to put what i've learned into action and see any results. But great course, well worth the time."
4,"The course content was very good and organised in the whole thought process. And it allowed layman newbie investor to understand the whole process of how to choose good stocks that will generally be better in performance. Many relevant analogies and examples were used to allow participants to be able to fully comprehend the application to the stock markets.  Reviewing this half way thru the course but I feel that it has been beneficial so far in teaching the know-hows. Many tips were shared and it was a good start on which better performing stocks to look at for beginner investors.   Price wise, I still feel that it is slightly on the high side for me."
5,Alvin‚Äôs teaching is systemic and the steps are easy to follow. He is engaging in his teaching and will make sure that all queries are answered.
4,"Just finished first day at Factor Based Investing Course (FBIC) today. Alvin used very easy to understand examples and comfortable pace, making it easy to understand and to absorb all the concepts. The class is taught in a very systematic way. Louis taught the technical parts on the calculations, pace is a bit fast for beginners but nevertheless, he has shown to be very experienced and knowledgeable in this domain. Additional bonus that there are some light quizzes to lighten the mood and also to check our understanding. Practical examples were used but due to time constraints, only a few examples can be touched on. It would be important to reinforce the knowledge learnt and put them into practice after class to put them to good use."
3,Introduction to course was balanced. There was no oversell. Sign up and follow up we‚Äôre appropriate. I find the course to be quite relevant as it puts a structure. Very Singapore specific and concentrated on property related stocks to some extent. Would Be good to make the coverage wider. Perhaps provide some data on application of the method to a wider section of industries would be good.
3,"This review is based on day 1 of a 2.5 day Factor-Based Investing Course.  Alvin was clear, concise, and most importantly, logical in the development of the communicating of his thoughts, at a pace that allowed time and space for some degree of ""thinking"" so as to ""connect the dots"".  That allowed a chance to formulate some questions and in the process, learning.  Although it was a one way commuication, the way and pace in which he expressed his ideas was more of a ""quasi-dialogue"" or conversation.  It was easier to engage in active listening.   Louis moved ""faster than a speeding bullet"" on the mechanical and technical aspects, and as such, there was little chance of ""connecting the dots"", and to understand the thinking behind what was being done.  Louis would be far more effective with his obvious wealth of knowledge if he could, (1) postpone addressing questions from the floor which he would subsequently be addressing later in his presentation, (2) use more of his personal experiences with clients, or in his own investments, to breathe life into and illustrate a technical point which tends to be ""dead"" unless the listener has an idea of the rationale behind what is being done.  Unfortunately, I am giving a generous three stars for now as I am yet to be able to know at an acceptable level of conceptualisation and understanding, how to ""connect the dots"" in the technical aspects.  To be fair, Alvin's summary at the end of day 1 ""rescued"" some of the lost opportunities for learning in the technical segment by framing the content and placing some order to the chaos."
4,The course has good structure and is easy to understand. Both Alvin and Louis communicate well with participants and provide good examples to support their explanations.
4,"The course was informative and easy to understand with a real stock example to guide students step by step how to do the calculation and choose the stock. attended my first class and too many information to digest for a beginner like me. would want more time to practise more and apply to my investment.   Generally, the speakers are knowledgeable and experience. they did a good job!"
5,Difficult and dry concepts made easy and interesting to understand. Kudos to the trainers who made the effort to give real life examples that were easy to relate to.

4,"Disclaimer: Attended the REITs Masterclass last month courtesy of a sponsored ticket from Seedly (thanks guys!) and my honest review.  Good course for those starting out in their investment journey, and are keen on using REITs as a vehicle. Covers the basics and fundamentals on how REITs work and operate, a bit on their tax structure (note, dividend distributions received as individuals are tax free), and what to look out for when selecting a REIT to invest into.  Case studies are also shared, and comparison done between two retail REITs listed here to give a perspective on how to choose a better REIT.   One thing to touch on is perhaps the amount of information to be shared and discussed within that short time span; may be overwhelming to new investors. May wish to consider breaking into 2 parts with lunch in between (no shortage of food in the immediate vicinity). This, as well as the somewhat cramped space.   I'll recommend this for those who want to invest into REITs but do not know how to start or which REIT to go with. This can also value add to those who are already investing into REITs but perhaps would like some fresh perspectives on guiding future REIT investments (like me). Great price, especially if you managed to get the early bird discount, easy to find location in town (ok, I'm just familiar with the place cos I've been to the exact same room for multiple previews for my mentor's programme; not to mention my old office building was nearby and I walk to Bugis often), good content makes this a no brainer for anyone to sign up.  Special thanks to Seedly for sponsoring this for us."
5,"I would say that the course is pretty informative, especially when you are just starting out in your investing journey! The investing mindset that is convey through the lesson can be used not just on REITs.   The course covered everything from the fundamentals of REITs to the analysis of REITs. There was even a timeslot for us to do some hands-on in analyzing some REITs.  It is a good course, pretty value for money. No hard-selling involved at all."
4,Good courses offered with reasonable price and with good aim of transferring knowledge! Trainers are very knowledgable and friendly.
5,"Dr Wealth explains concepts clearly, and the content is useful for anyone. Recommended for beginners to attend."

It looks like he's serious and passionate about finding out the best way to invest, put in the time and effort to research and put together his findings into this systematic and accessible course. The concepts and analysis are sound and well explained. Alvin is legit. Highly recommended. I wish I had gone for the course long ago."
4,Attended the Personal Finance Fundamental course conducted by Louis from Dr Wealth. Very insightful on the different aspects of Financial planning. Wish that I have attached the course at an earlier age. Useful calculators. 
5,"Been to many personal finance workshop and this is one of the better ones, providing practical tips and easy guidelines. Looking forward to more workshops from dr wealth :)"
5,Attended the Personal Finance Fundamental Course by Louis Koay.   Louis covered thoroughly the fundamentals of wealth planning and clearly illustrates the functions of different insurance and investments vehicles. I have gained a much better understanding on how I can optimise my income to protect and generate wealth.
5,Very informative and generous with info. Will recommend friends to attend.  Good examples and discussions. 
5,Attended the Personal Finance Fundamental Course by Louis Koay.   Very informative and learned a lot more on insurance and investments and retirement planning. 
4,"It has been many years since I done a proper financial review. I decided to attend the personal finance course and Louis shares unbias overview of different topics of savings, projection and investments, in particular bond investing which not many people are aware how it works.   In short, this is a course worth attending!"
5,"I went to many ""free"" Seminars  to check out the the courses they were offering, I was consumed by the hypes and even spent money to take up those courses.  It was only after those courses I discovered Dr Wealth's FBIC to be the most valuable, practical & realistic one.  Alvin offered support after the course, which in my opinion is extremely valuable. In other courses  I experienced no, late or even vague responses. True his guidance and his vision to help average joes like myself succeed in capitalism, his support will continue to build and remind you on the knowledge you have acquired in FBIC.   I am also extremely please to have Louis become my broker, his regular emails and advice. Something that other brokers do not even offer after you open an account with them.  Other courses I have attended are usually based on ""opinions"" on a certain. Alvin taught us how to calculate, he imparted us practical skills to pick assets, besides giving us the fish, we learnt how to fish ourselves.   I see the lecturers, Alvin and Louis are genuine people. They do not create hypes or ""ra-ras"", rather, they impart tested and proven strategies they themselves have used over the years that work for them. "
5,"I started reading many financial blogs and BigFatPurse was one of time. There, I joined their CNAV course which benefitted me a lot as a beginner investor. Alvin and Louis are both very sincere in their teachings and they made their CNAV concept so much easier to grasp for a beginner like me.   As they ‚Äòevolved‚Äô to DrWealth, I continued to follow them and also attended their Factor based investing where Alvin and Louis continue to impart more of their investment knowledge, hoping more people to benefit and start investing themselves.   Definitely no regrets in joining their courses! I even recommend my friends to join their course. Both Alvin and Louis are always so eager to share their knowledge with all the investors, whether new or experienced. Highly recommended with 2 thumbs up! "
4,"I started reading articles on the blog when DrWealth was still BigFatPurse and found the articles to be useful for kickstarting one's personal financial journey. What were particularly useful for me were the articles on term versus life insurance and the permanent portfolio. I attended a talk on the latter and then took the leap to attend the value investing mastery course and perhaps I was fortunate, but it was pitched at a level where technicalities were not too hard to grasp yet there was learning value to be had. These articles and talks are by no means the end-all to your financial pursuits and indeed, you might find yourself growing out of them and searching beyond for more in-depth material.  What I appreciated was the value circles that Alvin and company set aside time for and the training sessions where case studies were shared - but I actually learnt most from the challenging questions and insights from the floor.  DrWealth has not stopped developing new content but what is cool is that they keep to their core of financial education for the average man on the street - seen from the continuation of flagship courses in the personal financial mastery and factor-based investing spaces, and not trying to chase new things all the time. While it is useful for beginners like myself, DrWealth also developed other niche areas such as an angel investing course and was open to inviting external a speaker on cryptocurrency."
5,Rich in content and great in simplifying investing jargons and methods. Great for newbies and experienced people alike!
5,The FBIC was my first formal iinvestment course I signed up with as I resonate with the values and investment concepts shared by the Dr Wealth team. Gained a lot of insights as a newbie. 
5,"I came to know about DR Wealth through some recommendations. I am delighted the way that DR wealth provided all the free information on stock for newbie  like me. I have been reading so many online stock tips but it does not really teach me the fundamental of how to understand the stock. I signed for the FBIC course and during these 3 days course ,  i learned all the good practice and  basics of value investing.Especially during all the case studies ,  it really helped me to see & understand the company deep down.  Their stock analytics are very objective & no bias .Most Importantly ,  they are very eager to share all information either from the website or facebook group.  There is no hard selling for any products whatsoever."
4,"I had attended other free workshops by others and this is the axiom of value investing.  I was introduced to Dr Wealth from Cheerful.egg blog. Dr Wealth's blog has frank informative articles highlighting dogmatic points and I decided to attend one of their public workshop. Dr Wealth does not impress one ostentatiously with giant corporate names but rather educate one back to the very core of value investing.  Before attending the FBIC course, I still harboured scepticism of how much would they impart their knowledge to those that are not in the game. I was proven wrong, Dr Wealth's team patiently coached me on understanding the intimidating financial reports, factors to analyse the stocks and with the correct strategy. Within the program, teachings are put into practical stimulations, no fancy software, just working through the compendium of notes they provided. This gave me more confidences even Alvin did emphasis frequently as a reminder historical data is not indicative of future progress.  Dr Wealth does follow-ups with the graduates from the FBIC course.   I was so sold by their fastidious methods, genuine personalities without gimmicks and went on to join the insider. It is relatively pricey ;'(   , although there are many other premium features that come along, still it hurts my pocket.   All in all, it is a well paced and gives a good coverage for the intended objective, I truly learnt a great deal from them.   I wish it has a better value of money prices for young investors, who do not have much capital, hence the 4 stars.   "
5,"Dr Wealth is a breath of fresh air in this financial education industry where many are just out to milk you like a cash cow - sell, cross sell, upsell, hard sell. The people behind Dr Wealth are genuine (proven through the years I've been with them) and are concerned about the financial well-being of this value investing community that they have built over the years. They are gurus in their own right but do not proclaim so. They feel more like the everyday Singaporean helping out fellow Singaporeans. I love reading their articles which are insightful, concise and humorous. Keep it up guys!"
5,"FBIC is the first formal investment course I attended. I chose it as there were many good reviews and I liked that the methods used were simple to understand and backed by scientific research. The focus is on fundamental analysis (value and dividend investing) and touches a little on technical analysis.  The 2 and a half day workshop covers 3 strategies, namely CNAV, GPAD, and MODO (more information can be found here: https://www.drwealth.com/factor-based-investing). It was conducted by a team of qualified professionals it was done at a pace which was generally easy to follow. Only the last strategy (MODO) was a bit harder to understand. However, I believe the other 2 strategies would be sufficient for most retail investors.  I would highly recommend this course to anybody who wants to start learning about investing. Even if you have prior investing experience, it would be worthwhile to attend the course as you can enhance your own investment strategies.  Combining good mentors and adopting tried & tested methods will make it much easier to kickstart/accelerate your investment journey."
4,Alvin and team at Dr Wealth have really simplified investing and the realm of knowledge. I did wish there were an increased frequency of classes as well as personal coaching if opportune.   Only rated 4 because I wish they had an iPhone app :)
4,"I went for the Factor Based Investing Course (FBIC) and was taught the methodology of investments. I get to learn a great deal of investments jargon and really knowing how go about investing for a beginner like me. They also offer platforms to help beginners to constantly refresh what we have learnt and ease us on the time taken to research on the various stocks before buying. They also do have monthly discussions for investors to talk about updates and discuss on some of the investments they have bought. It's really an opener for a ""noob"" like me, and I really appreciate how open they are on sharing the information with us. "
4,"I started out as a beginner at end of 2016 and went for many previews of different courses as well as attending a few investment courses. One thing that really struck me about Dr Wealth's team like Alvin and Louis were that they were really sincere in their knowledge sharing. No hardselling as well which i really appreciate. And the little insights that was dropped along the way was very good. For example, reasons why IPO-ed are usually considered overpriced and when do companies choose to go IPO.   I took the CNAV course as well as the Factor Based Investing course. I really like the CNAV course as they teach you a practical step-by-step method on how to value a company based on their financial statements and decide when to buy and sell. Very hands-on and good for beginners. It's a value investing type of method though, so sometimes patience is required as with all value investing. Alvin puts his money where his mouth is and also shares his portfolio and when he buys and sells and for what reason.  I would say Factor Based method is more theoretical and may be more difficult to understand for a pure beginner. The factors are based on research and are probably easier to understand for someone with a bit of background. Similarly, stocks/ETFs bought and sold through this method are shared as well.  Value for money: One of the best!  Insights: Many.   Instructors: Very sincere people. No hard-selling"
5,"I attended their FBIC course and personal finance fundamentals course and benefited immensely from it. They have made concepts in investing easy to understand. They also gave methodical, actionable steps for me to follow when deciding about an investment. They also have nothing to hide. They make investments based on the strategy they teach n are open abt what they bought and their portfolio returns. To me, this is the best thing abt them, they have skin in the game. I highly recommend their course anyone who want to learn to invest well."
5,"I enrolled for their FBIC where I was taught three methods of investing. Dr Wealth backs their methods with scientific studies and of course, they put their money where their mouth is by also investing in the stock market with their methodologies!  The course breaks the materials down into easy to understand and ready to apply methods with some examples for hands on practice. The FBIC is suitable for investors of all backgrounds wanting to learn how to use and apply Dr Wealth's methods."
3,"Application was quite easy, but had a hiccup during delivery that was eventually resolved after contacting customer support. Network is buggy sometimes."
1,"I had the worst nightmare when I signed up for zero mobile. I wanted to know whether I have my number ported and they took almost three weeks to reply.  After reply, I told them I do not wish to continue as service is bad and they billed me $60 immediately and give me one day to pay or add $10 penalty fee. Bad service and no mercy in billing . I am going to case to report and report to minister of IMDA at west coast"
1,Horrible. No respone. Block me from Facebook when i enquire. Over charge me since day one. Please beware. Already complained to IMDA and file a case with CASE ref T20180710508
1,"First, it took ages to receive my sim, try activating the sim but the key code is wrong so i email them for help but it took them 1 week to reply,  monthly invoice the total sum always wrong it took them 1 month to reply me now i'm piss off i want to end my contract but since July they totally ignore me and block me on Facebook. "
1,"This is my nightmare of my life i ever sign up with zeromobile, i sign up my intrest for this telco and thats where my nightmare started. I had receive my sim card and a day later i change my mind to cancel the service since its not on contract based and i did not activate the card. Back then i send numerous of email to address on this and ask for termination and can you believed none was reply but they will however merge all the wmail you send and by end of the day there were no reply to settle this issue. Guess what but the time I received the email from them i already charge 2 invoice and late charge where i send email again to them non was replied but however the system will merge all email send and return to u similarly with no replied solution. BEST part which i did not slot in my sim card for any activation of any kind but they will enforce you to make payment which they dont even want to reply ur email at all. Regrets haing this service in my whole life. I sincerely hope you will not be a victim of what i go thru. "
1,Zero Mobile is a cheat and their customer service is absolutely fucked up!! I was very angry when I told them that I did the registration only to register my interest and they instead charged me a hundred dollars from my card without even my permission. I did not even receive my SIM card on delivery date as well and when I asked for a refund none of the buggers in their customer support bothered to give me a refund. Please do not trust these cheats. Circles life and other telcos can more trustworthy than this shitty ass network.
1,"The absolute nightmare of all time.... All is bullshits..... Worst of all they extort your monies like nobody business.. If you do not have enough monies to pay up, they disrupt your number without hesitation. They inform that they have apps in google play store for android user... Its a stupid joke,  do not have any at all So you are not able pay if you have the monies And you are left suspended in the mid air. The customer service does not help you at all by giving ways to let you settle the bill. They are suppose to assist you but they worst then ever."
1,"I would glady give it -5 stars or no stars if it was possible. I had the absolute worst experience with this company. Let's start off with the good part. The service works. That's it. Now for my experience with the customer service. In Jun they double charged me on a bill. I sent them an email. No reply. End July, I had enough of the company, I sent another email to cancel the service for good. No reply. Come August, I emailed them again. This time with an email to the bank to stop payment. They replied. They refunded me the August charge but required me to pay the charges till then. July had been paid already but still they texted me a legal action taken message. Absolutely the worst. I will be lodging a complain with CASE."
2,"I will continue to use this due to their unlimted data. Speed wise not bad, between 4g+ and 4g. But their customer service is VERY LOUSY. From the moment you sign up, sim card delivery, sim activation, advance billing even when yet to use. And they charge me for April even though i activate in May.But it state will return in credits over account in coming days if activated on later day then indicated. Amount was cut from account ,2nd bill received.Requested a NEW sim card number but given a RECYCLE number and worst still got  so many spam sms and calls, eg, geneva,london australia.request to port my current number over who month no response,It makes you wonder if there is any working inside this company.  Anyway those who sign up need to have real patience with this company. Take alook first at their FB page review"
1,"God awful service, walk away before it‚Äôs too late!   1) they throttle your data at around 40gb a month, stating that you have ‚Äúthrottled or tethered‚Äù your phone, even though I did not do so. 2) non existent customer service that replies to emails fucking slowly. Compared to circles.life customer service, this is a joke. 3)made me absorb the first month of fees even though they didn‚Äôt port my number, could not even refute since they said the bill starts upon delivery. 4)silence any and all criticisms on their Facebook comments so that new people will not know better."
1,"1. Lure you with promotion price in August. Then withheld the registration till Sept. 2. Oct 2018, old plan discontinue and change plan to higher price without informing.  Simple words. Cheating  Please don't be like me. Read bad review but still signed up. "
1,"Stated superfast 4G network but only getting 3G and its still damn slow compared to my Starhub 3G. Customer service wise will take really long to get a reply from them, i regret now and still waiting for them to reply my email and to terminate my Zero X service. I don't recommend anyone to buy Zero X."
1,"All of the case you guys talked about here is nothing compared  To mine.i registered zero mobile online lastyear about feb 18 then found out their service provider is singtel then immediately sent an email to cancle because my company dont have reception for singtel.About march 18 they say they have received my email and processing it.july 18 they sent me another mail saying that my number is successfully stopped and sad to see me go bla bla bla bla and will charge me up to july 18.later today early in the morning like 4am i check my uob online banking for some transactions that i rarely do and to my shocking,theres a deduction by ZERO SG for 59+ SGD at JUN 2019 !! Nowonder they dont have a physical company or a phone number to contact .i will file a police report today at 18 jun 2019 because this is like stealing !!"
1,Shittiest Telco I ever use in my life. Those who plan to sign up because of their unlimited data do think twice. There are established Telco in the market providing the same service but at a higher price. There is always reason why there is a difference. 
1,"Can I give it ZERO rating ...  faced problems from day one   1. They started giving 59 dollars unlimited plan.. when I asked them to change mine from 69 to 59 ... they state dits for new sign up only.  2. They did auto deduction twice in the month of December. ( good I cancelled my card due to some issues )  3. Penalty charges of delayed payment are exorbitantly high - 25 dollars and it would be auto deducted. ( good I cancelled my card due to some issues ). Also fought them over for the penalty charges which they after multiple followups revoked,  4. speed and mobile call wise its ok ... but no cheap international roaming - no cheap international calling facility ( i started using Skype as for this )   Finally, I ported away a few days back to another service provider.   "
1,I'm been using this Zero Mobile for a few month tbh they are really CMI the 1st one week later my speed is slow as he'll as I can't ever see my fb or Instagram those normal app as I'm using the SO CALL UNLIMITED  plan so I been asking them by emailing and finally they reply that is 2 month later saying I can only use 1gb per day if I over use it they will slow down my speed and now new things happen they charge me 2 time $69.95 for this Dec mean nearly $140 for this month!!! What the Hell!!! I email them and they reply they will check everything and will get back to me  Anyone olso has this problem and any idea what can I do???
5,No issues in collecting and activating the sim card. Having 4G Internet speed at ease. Competitive price plan for unlimited everything.  I would recommend to my friends and family.
5,The internet speed is fast and the delivery of the sim card is efficient. I would like to recommend this service provider to my family.
1,"utterly horrible . One of the worst and extremely horrible customer service as well. Told me I can only use 1 GB a day but I cannot even access my whatsapp, email or surf anything everayday I had it. Cannot even use 1 MB of it!!! I terminate it immediately! Extremely terrible! "
1,"I signed up zeroX during pc show. I was given sim card on the spot but realised there is no 4g data. I was assured by zero mobile sales lady during pc show that 4g data will be activated days later and I will receive an email when activated. And I will only be charged only when 4g data is activated. No email was sent and I only realised it accidentally, days later. Bill came and I was charged even on days when there is no 4g data. I paid my bill, discounting off the days with unactivated 4g data. I requested NOT to store my credit card information when paying. However, to my dismay, the remaining amount is automatically charged still! Oh my! The customer service will be choosy on their reply to your submitted support ticket. Good ones, they can response promptly. When asking for money, they will send you email diligently. However, when you ask questions to their disadvantage, the response will be very slow. And mostly, ignored. I guess I am in danger that when I decided to terminate the subscription by submitting support ticket, they will simply continue to charge you until months later. Please think twice before you sign up. There are many options out there..."
1,"Service is horrible. Literally non-existent, especially after you've paid. They lure you with promotion prices but then they still charge you their non promotion prices and you're stuck with it because you can't cancel nor can you get them to refund you! I've been emailing them for over a month since I joined. "
1,"Pls do not sign. bad expericence with customer service. I receive my sim card, activated and unlock the sim pin. after then i found the network is 3G connection. no 4G network. very slow speed. I have request a ticket to their supoort team but guess what, so far it take more than 3 weeks no reply. other customers also fed up with their services. some customers having sim card issues because the pin code doesn't work and their sim card was locked with PUK code. some customers waiting for their sim card to arrive and so far they are waiting more than 3 weeks above, customers who receive the sim card already activated but 3G network. no 4G network. check out in facebook comment SIM Delivery Update at https://www.facebook.com/GoZeroSG/?hc_ref=ARR8PwkDN2vdtBIGW4eB8WFyHebCIkCjRs1zXsL5eAlFX9o6ZBnG4Z61uCDG1GFfD1o&fref=nf  pls read the comment before you sign up if you wish to subscipe. thank you!"
5,"Rather new to this service but have no complain as of yet. Haha.  Pretty much no drop on network or suffer any lag so far in surfing my usual bouts such as Netfkixt, Youtube and whatever. One of d best telco so far and as of now, am a happy customer.  One feedback tho,  a dedicated app wud be helpful so we could see how much data has being consume for d current month at d very least. I know its unlimited but yea.  Other then that. Im happy"
3,"Not friendly customer service & just trying out for the first month cause i was given with no choice , i cant even cancel even before the simcard arrive or get a refund of $18 on the subscription ."
1,hi. at first time the network was so gd and awesome.but after 2 month the network was to slow.when try to mail and ask they reply that only can use 1 GB per day.the plan that I bought is unlimited plan .is to bad 
4,Signup was OK.. all done online. The delivery service was a little slow but worked OK as I missed the first delviery. Apparently the service is 3G until they open full 4G. Data speed is awesome. Does anyone know which network they use?
1,"Tried to apply since dec. after numerous checking of status they just went ahead and refunded me without consulting me. had to reapply in Feb. received sim card in april. Now May, still unable to activate."
3,Pros: unlimited everything for first 3000 sign ups at only $65/mth.  Cons: Not for everyone. Do you really need unlimited everything when you can get wireless pretty much everywhere now and cheaper plan @ $30 and below? 
5,"The service so far is good, the support was very helpful and very prompt. It will be better if there is an in app for users to track their data usage."
1,"Speedwise it was fine. But service and billing? AWFUL. And don't believe in the ""unlimited data"" crap, they cap your data usage at 1GB, if you exceed it they threaten you with the fact that they can at their discretion charge you at commercial usage rate because you exceed 1GB. What rubbish! If I were to stream movies and NF and Youtube all day, I easily exceed 1GB!   Zero service more like. Honestly, their billing was the most horrendous. Please please do not believe the good review here. Zero Mobile is a Nightmare from Day 1. I was lured by unlimited data for the promotion price of $59.95 but right from the beginning, I have NEVER enjoyed the promotion price.   They kept billing me wrongly@ $69.95, and despite the customer service  crediting me back ONCE the extra billed amount, can you imagine EVERY month is a wrong bill? If I had signed up for $69.95 fine. But I didnt! Yet they were unable to fulfil their promise of $59.95 and neither was their customer service able to stop it from recurring! Every month I still get billed at $69.95! And I signed up in late Aug/early Sept 2018. it has only been a couple of months and never have they gotten a bill right.   Their customer service is very bad, they will wilfully ignore certain emails/tickets, only selectively respond. Sometimes I don't get a response at all. I think they hope I will just give up and go away. Maybe they are overwhelmed by angry customer emails. Either way, if they should handle a case, they SHOULD resolve it. They never do. My problem keeps happening EVERY MONTH and I am so tired of it.  Now I have a problem, I want to terminate but I am STUCK with them. How can I stop them from billing and terminate my service with them??  This is a true NIGHTMARE. I am still having problems with them and this is nearing HALF A YEAR of using their service! Can you believe it??!! What other telco is like that??"
1,how do I terminate this shitty zero sg anyone help? I've received thier sim card but cant activate it. so basically I'm can't use it at all but they are still charging me but I insist of paying but they are still sending invoice anyone know how to terminate it? 
4,Hi. Appreciate your help on the billing issues . Its a great relief on my side now . Thanks for the prompt reply also . My mind is at ease now and  i will definitely will refer  Zero Mobile to my friends .
4,"Got an email stating that my line will be suspended due to overdue payment.  Email them stating the reason. And to my surprise, they giving me more time to make payment. Kudos to Zero X. And yes indees everything unlimited. What more u can ask for. Thank you!"
5,Fast customer serivce! Nice workers  UNLIMITED EVERYTHING I MEAN COME ONN!! GOO ZERO MOBILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I‚Äôm going to say that Singapore Telecom is the best TELCO in Singapore ! .................................
5,"Fast delivery! Hassle-free! 4G Data is working perfectly fine too! Hopefully, there will be more upcoming promotions to serve existing consumers well! Excellent service, prompt reply of email from customer service."
5,Excellent service in Singapore since my family are using zero one mobile line thanks I would like to Encourage my friends to apply zero one mobile
5,"Customer Service is on point, unlike the rumours say. Network coverage is excellent and network speeds is swift. Competitive rates too!"
5,"Very pleased with the service, there was no issues except for the delivery timing of the sim as it was set by the company"
5,So far speedy replies from the CS(customer service) whenever i need some enquiry they are fast to reply. Basically i love this telco. So far no disruption of data and receotions. Excellent. I recommend everyone to try this telco. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
5,Great excellent customers servic when i not sure the staffs replying fast and able to help me solve my worry üëÆüëç i would like to suggest it possible zero sg able to provide some mobile to those new sign up or port in customers and possible given a installment plan for getting a mobile and charge into the bill monthly 12/24 months contact will be more great üëÆüòù
5,Great network to start with. Great plan for a user like me. Recommended to my friends and family. Good network compared to other telco. Give a heavy DATA user a better life
5,Dont doubt their network strength.  The really have the BEST NETWORK IN SG.  Ive wasted my time and money with other telcos not being able to use fully the plans that they have for me due to locations that have weak to none coverage strength.  With ZERO. Im just satisfied with it n will be able to enjoy the amount that i pay for their plan fully.  Start using ZERO and see the difference.  Dont run in CIRCLES.  Run in ZERO üòéüëå
5,Best customer service...helped me with everything i meeded to know. Best telco in singapore by far. totaly recommend .
5,"Best customer service Representative's , very friendly ,  Best network never lags ! Keep up the brilliant work you guys .."
5,"Almost a year with Zeromobile. Registered it when it was launched and I had no major issues. Minor issues were addressed swiftly and am receiving prompt replies and support through email. As it uses ""singtel satellite"", speed wasn't an issue either. Would Certainly recommend this to anyone who uses lots of data :)"
5,Great new telecom with very good plans! Their service and connectivity is also very good.
1,Really poor or no service. No hot line to call customer service when I joined in 2018. Only can submit support tickets and wait few days for response.  They port over my SIM card number when I didn't receive my SIM. Cancelled my line after few months and they still continue to charge me.  Had to submit support ticket to complain and ask for refund.  Really bad experience. Very robotic and standard email responses. No human touch in their email communication too.
5,Amazing network service. Great customer service. No lag. Totally worth it. I'll definitely recommend this to my friends.
5,"Supperb customer service ! #neverrunintocircles  The only thing , is better if there is an app for zero ."
5,Great Customer Service. The Network and Unlimited Date is Superb Perfect. Will Recommended to my Family n Friends to Zero Sg. Good job guys!!üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
5,The unlimited zero plan is perfect for me.make my daily job much more easy for me.l will recommend to my friends.the speed is good.
5,Superb data speed.. the only thing is that im unaware or maybe its my mistake to overlook about the data speed cap at 30 gb.. i don really know whether i really used up that 30 gb. it will be better if u all make an apps for it so that we customers wont have to many question playing in our mind... and also we could keep track bout out usage thank u zeromobile..
5,Been good for me. its jus a singtel line but much cheaper. i port my number over few months back from circles because it was a better deal - then just now they have a new promo with better price for people porting numbers and they let me change my plan to the new cheap price. would be good to have roaming but otherwise its good connection good speed and good price.
5,üëç good experience so far with unlimited data plan. Data connection is reliable. 2 months old customer here :)). Recommend to others to give a try as no contract involved.
5,I‚Äôm using the Zero X plan and so far it‚Äôs great! Great reception and no issues with my mobile data!
5,"Hello, definitely will give a 5 star rating to this Telco plan.i am very satisfied with this service as it is my first time using this plan"
5,Hi i am giving a 5 star rating sinc it was 1st month i am very satisfied to the speed if this telco awesome experience hope the charges will be okay :)
4,Used it for a number of months now and the service if reasonable for the price. It‚Äôd be good if they could improve customer service. Better value than most option here though.
4,"Been using Capital Match since 2016.   Pros: - Allows for fractional investing, even a $0.01 can be invested! Good diversification. - Automatic investing, just set and run - Good follow up on delayed payments and defaults. The team uploads documents on the status of debt collection. - Updated almost daily/weekly with new offers, you won't run out of investing opportunities.  Cons: - As with all investments, there are default risks involved. Some of my 2016 loans are still being chased for collection. - There are commissions charged, so interest rate is actually lower than advertised. Well, nothing is free :) - $5 withdrawal fee"
4,Pros: Lots of deal and automated investment with ability to restrict by debtor too. Cons: No apps. For Info: Withdrawal costs $10.
3,"I have invested in several crowd funding Platforms. Capital match platform and funding requests lacks clarity to show the history of the funding (e.g. How many times this facility has been funded before and history of timeliness of payment). This resulted in me unknowingly investing in same facilities repeatedly even some (e.g. sa*m*n, fl*xtr*n*c Etc they originate from same facility that have significant delay/no payment as it is not conveyed clearly. This info is the bare minimum that should be included. All other platforms do so while noting that the company borrowing is not revealed that is understandable. Capital match should seriously review this"
4,"I have been using this P2P platform since year 2016. And I have also opted for auto funding (which means to fund the company automatically), which allows me to diverse my investments to different company with funds as low as a few dollars. I am sure it helps in reducing the risk of investing in any one company with a min of SGD$1000 if one was to invest in a company manually. Of course there were companies that took very long to return investors the money. It will be good for investors to check on the status of the investment on a regular basis. "
3,"Have been using this for the longest time.  Recently they have decided to use a segregated account for client funds.  Unlike the other p2p operators, they want to charge extra fees for withdrawals.  Very agressive in collection.  Some loans with them currently waiting for auction of property to recover principal and interest.  Mostly invoice financing of 1 to 3 months.  They recently tried to offer USD loans but althought the required USD deposits, they wanted to repay lenders in SGD.  Not much interest and they changed to accepting SGD eventually.  Very low amount required for each loans as they apportion the loan to all interested lenders.  So each loan you make can be as low as a few dollars.  However, this is not always the case, recently they don't do so all the time.  Still trying to figure out the basis that the decide on allocating a loan to investor."
3,Have used it before a year back and it is relatively easy to use. I was just irate that some deals I wanted to enter but it gets fully subscribed in less than 5 mins.  I also invested in one company that defaulted in loans and I lost quite a bit on that one which ended up having little profit in the whole portfolio. This is not really for the faint hearted honestly and go in with your eyes open that you can lose your capital.
5,"Works well, fees are great and very transparent, relatively quick customer service and both the mobile and web platforms work well too. Very customizable"
5,"Signed up for Saxo 3-4 years ago and been using it since. Using it for overseas equity and the fees are fair - per transaction was $4 for most of my trades. Nice mobile app, trades are executed fast, nice interface, no gripe with it so far and no plans to switch out to another platform (for overseas equity). :) "
5,"Https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/rates-and-conditions/equities-and-etfs/commissions  I recently noticed that Saxo has reduced their trading fees for some exchanges. E.g. for NYSE, the minimum trading fee is USD3 - USD4 .   https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/rates-and-conditions/commissions-charges-and-margin-schedule/overview  Also, from 1 April 2019, they will waive the monthly custody fee of USD 5 for SGX stocks."
5,"Been using Saxo for two years and stuck to it because of its low trading fees, intuitive mobile app and powerful analytics tools, allowing me to easily track my trading performance. It covers many markets and I use it primiarly for US stocks (it has low fees for SG stocks too, comparable to standchart). Having a great experience so far. I had experience using DBS, POEMS but I must say that Saxo is much better."
5,Relatively fair transaction fees... esp for international  markets.... mobile app is easy to use too
5,Good for dining which will earn 3.2miles per dollar spent. Call centre is always friendly and do not have to wait for too long.
4,One of the few cards in the market that offers perpetual annual fee waiver. Definitely a card to keep based on this reason.
5,"PERfect Card for the traveler if you time it right. (The picture shows the black CIMB World MasterCard which I think is different from the silver CIMB platinum MasterCard).  The CIMB platinum MasterCard is great for travelers as there‚Äôs 10% Cashback on airline, hotel, travel transport overseas up to $60 per billing month. Minimum spending $500, 8 transactions of $30 minimum spending. Also 1% foreign currency admin fee waiver by crediting to your bill in the next month. Also there‚Äôs extra cash rebates for wellness products like shopping at guardian, Watson‚Äôs or some hospitals , health checks etc.  especially prefer it to purchase airline tickets. Fuss-free cash back terms & conditions. "
4,"with its zero fee on foreign currency transactions, CIMB platinum is quite a good card for use at overseas  where it is not easy to exchange for that country's currency in Singapore.   I personally used it in Iceland. Despite the 1.5% to 2% charge for converting from Iceland Krona to SGD for bill payment, It is a better choice than carrying cash. This is because in Singapore, one has to change to British pounds (0.5% commission lost) and then at Iceland Airport, we will have to change the pounds to iceland Korna (1.5% commission loss). It resulted in a 2% loss one way. Hence for countries which is difficult to exchange currency here, I will recommend this card.  In addition, CIMB has a very good sign on promotion for new members (Spend $400 inf irst month, get $120 cash back). definitely a credit card better than our local bank's. "
5,Fast and cheap! I got $25 off by using sembcorp power electricity promo code referral code.  code: 2SW5DB63                                          
4,I switched to Sembcorp since Feb 2019.  I love to use their app as I can easily view 12 months bill history.  The app also allow easy management of my bill and even tell me how much I have saved to date. 
4,"Application process was quickly through their website, and they have relatively good promos for a 2 year fixed price plan.   I was able to view my bills and payments using their SembCorp app and invoices were downloaded as pdf via their SembCorp app.  Payments for SembCorp bills can done via mobile AXS which was also very convenient."
5,"After switching to sembcorp, I'm saving averagely 20% as compared previously. Great app easy to use. Easy payment mode. "
5,"After switching to sembcorp power, I can see the different and save about $50. Website is clear and easy to use. "
4,"Best to sign up at roadshow whereby there are more promotions such as vouchers and credit card bill rebate. However, do keep track of the bill rebate and inform the bank if you do not get the rebate by end of the stated month."
5,"Application process was efficient and smooth! Would definitely recommend to anyone who asks me, or don‚Äôt ask me. "
5,Switching over to Sembcorp was the right choice I‚Äôve made given the very competitive rates and extremely responsive and friendly customer service. Signing up was very fast and seamless. All is done in less than 5 mins!
5,"Application of Sembcorp Electricity is pretty simple to use and the price plan they offered are reasonable. During first conversion and encounter with their Customer Service is also pleasant and clear. Overall, a pretty good choice of supplier. "
4,Application process has been fast and easy. No stoppage of electricity so far. Will recommend as it is a reputable company and likely will stay long term
5,Switched over to Sembcorp after friend recommendation.. Got a bill rebate of $70 and application is fast & easy! 
5,"Decided to switch to sembcorp after my friend jio-ed me to join the group plan that someone started which had a better rate than most on the market. The signing up was pretty smooth and managed to switch over to sembcorp then.  No issues so far, everything has been smooth. Been using it for about 6 months now and saved about $300+ up to date!"
5,the switch from SP to sembcorp was simple - sembcorp offers competitive rates & my first bill is $0. YAY! so far so good (:
5,Excellent experience and observed a significant reduction on the monthly bill for mat 3 months.I would definitely recommend this to others.
5,Sembcorp Power was my first choice given its a trusted brand and long presence in the Singapore market. As expected the application process was smooth with overall $100 in vouchers and experience so far has been fantastic with significant savings as promised. Will recommend to switch to Sembcorp without any second thought!!
4,"Very easy experience with sembcorp! Sign up online on their website and as a NTUC member, can enjoy promo rate on their fixed rate plan for 24 months contract. Don't even need to copy promo code, just click plan with NTUC icon! Plus tons of free sign up gifts. All done at comfort of home, no need to visit any place in order to enjoy the specials or promos  Very seamless and idiot proof process, which their mobile app is also extremely simple and fast to use. You can do almost everything on their app, from details update, billing, notifications, no need to access their website on a PC. Lastly, special monthly rebates when recurring bill to OCBC 365 credit card, lovely!  If they can do away with requirement of security deposit, definitely 5 stars rating!üòÇ"
5,"I've switched to Sembcorp Power in March 2019. No regrets.  Not only was the tariff rate given low, I also received bill rebates and Fairprice Vouchers too.  Roadshow staff was friendly and eager to answer my questions.  Switching over was seamless and worry-free, as expected. The bills provided were easy to read and to understand.  The option to switch to the credit card recurring payment system gives alot of convenience for bill payment. I do not have to make a trip down to the nearby Convenience Store or Payment Machines to pay the bills.  I have saved around $30 per month since the start of the service.  The SembcorpPower Portal (both on the website and the app) is very convenient for checking the current and previous month's usage and bills. The only downside to the app is that I have to log in every time just to use the app. I hope that it can be improved so that we are able to check basic things on the app without logging in every single time.  Overall, SembcorpPower is a great choice for the Open Electricity Market. Great service and deals. I do foresee myself continuing to use Sembcorp's services in the future."
5,Application process is easy as the promoter would guide u along step by step. The price being offered is also good. 
1,Service sucks and have to do administrative works all by myself as my mum is very old but yet sembcorp's staff doesnt help at roadshow. Staff does not know their own work. Application keeps delaying.
5,Great app for user to track the usage and bill payment. Good to switch and hope for auto metering service will be provide free for all exiting or new user. 
4,Nice web and app UI and customer service replies quickly on Sembcorp Power facebook messaging.   The bill typically comes around 2 weeks later than SP billing as there is the measurements from SP meters need to be verified. 
5,"I signed up during the roadshow at bishan junction 8 last year. The promoter is very friendly and explains to us the details.  During that point of time, there are lucky dip, vouchers, bill rebate and credit card bill payment rebate.  With the increase in electricity tariff in singapore, we are so fortunate to be able to enjoy the fixed rate throughout the next 2 years."
5,"Started in Jan. everything was smooth and signed up online. I download the app. It tells me the details of the bill. Every month I would also receive an email on the bill. The payment was done through CC recurring, I have yet to receive the $40 rebate for OCBC recurring though.."
4,"I have applied for Discount 24 months Tariff plan and all my queries have been replied within 3-5 days after I make the enquires. But my discount rebate of $70 still have not credit to me yet. I have download the Sembcorp app, it is easy to use because it is simple and straightforward but not very informative in content. Sembcorp rate is about the same as all other providers across the board. If I intend to go for green energy I will use Sunseap which is 90-100% solar power."
4,"On the Discount off Tariff Plan. So far, I really enjoy the convenience of checking my bills online. Excellent service."
5,"Sembcorp comes with an easy-to-use app and their customer service is very responsive and helpful. More importantly, the pricing is very competitive too! "
5,"Thank you for Sembcorp Power Pte Ltd provide high quality of customer service to us.  I got a few enquiries, Sembcorp Power replied me fast without spending my time for waiting the answers.  And, we signed up for the package which tariff lower than the market tariff rate.  It really save us alot!  Besides, I can update my credit card information anytime in the Sembcorp Power app without filling and mailing the form to the company.  While Sembcorp Power help us to save our ATM, we also save the earth by reducing the electricity usage.  Hope you continue to provide low tariff rate to Singapore residents.  Once again, thank you Sembcorp Power!"
5,"Thanks to Seedly, I have signup Fixed Price Plan 24m with Sembcorp Power due to their attractive promotions.   I saved more than 30% monthly just by switching by Electricity Provider to Sembcorp Power online effortlessly~!  I especially liked the 'Free 12-month Home Protection Plan with Great Eastern', 'One-time $50 bill rebate for NTUC members' and 'One-time cashback of S$50 by setting up recurring bill payment with 'Standard Chartered Credit Card'   Sembcorp Power has an app, that I could view my power usage monthly, weekly and even hourly! I could track or adjust my power usage when there is an usually high usage. Thanks for the usage app that I able to to track a faulty electrical appliance in my kitchen!  Monthly bill is effortless, just key in my Standard Chartered Credit Card for the first time in the app and following months are charged automatically, I do not have to worry about forgetting to pay my bills.   "
5,"Other than the fixed rate prices and rebates, having good support makes a big difference. The call center is responsive and professional in answering my queries (without the long wait for an operator to answer). The app is both useful and informative to get your bill timely."
5,"I‚Äôm on sempcorp for 3 months only, but it‚Äôs about 20% cheaper than SP compared to my previous bill. And it‚Äôs on the same bill as SP."
5,Generally been with them for 4 months ... everything going fine . Recently just received the bank additional cash rebate for paying with the credit card
4,Switch electric dk why electric run faster before switch and it used more electric the price is around the same just more electric used.
5,"Had done much research and used seedly as one of my main comparison site. Ultimately I chose sembcorp 24M fixed price because of a few factors (in order of importance):  1) must have some form of green energy involvement (sembcorp does has it although not 100%)  2) reputable company, preferable local  3) pricing (I managed to find a group buy and the price offered is really the lowest I can find). Price is not top factor to me because regardless of which company you switch to, you are already saving as compared to SP."
5,"Just get onboard with sembcorp. A big company make it more reliable, and the fee structure is much more transparent comparing to some small tricky ones. Greater deal if you able to work it out with some cashback credit cards, unlike SP power which only accepts POSB Everyday Credit Card. =)"
5,"Apart from cost savings and a hassle-free billing system, Sembcorp also possesses indigenous capabilities in power generation, thus making them a trusted partner in serving the needs of both businesses as well as households."
4,"Sembcorp is a big company and well established so I no longer have to concern if they will stop service abruptly. And everything runs smoothly, bill and past usage can easily seen in their app. I‚Äôve gotten a fix rate plan and I am enjoying more that 20% saving on electricity bills. Just imagine how much money we can save just by switching."
4,"sembcorp is well established in singapore. they have their own power generator compared to some providers that are ""virtual"" based. Transfer is relatively problem free. wasnt affected by the jurong blackout on 18 sep (even if jurong hospital was affected - hospital is more critical). the small issue is that now i get 2 separate utility bills, so a bit more complicated to record my household usages (for example, tuas power dont have this issue). Hope that sembcorp can work with sp services to upgrade on this. Hope to have more freebies from sembcorp as im one of the first 700 sign-ups!"
3,The latest card in the miles arena. Flexible in terms of the reward to exchange for all miles/vouchers/Cashback. No conversion fee for air miles.
4,This is a brand new card introduced by OCBC in September. Mainly aim for customer looking for miles points collection. Everything is good expect there is not free VIP lounge access. 
3,"Pros  1) Good if you haven't hold any Amex Acend or Krisflyer card before to get the first join miles (if you hold any amex miles card before and receive any miles as welcome gift, then they will not give this points anymore) 2) Good sign up gifts (S$150 CapitaVoucher Welcome Offer) 3) I use the 4 complimentary access each year to any participating SATS Premier Lounge in Singapore and Plaza Premium Lounge around the world to bring family and friends to go enjoy before flights per year.  4) Try to use SQ for biz and personal travel then once get Gold class,  can also bring 2 guest and use together with this 4 voucher to lounge access. 5) Used to be another group now change to Complimentary night stay each year at one of over 110 Hilton Properties in Asia Pacific. Again limited choice and have to beware and T&C , peak period not available etc).   Cons: They make customer pay annual fee the moment customer receive the card and annual fees [$337.05] very high :(  Good only  if you always take SQ flights but other miles card give better deals. "
4,"Signed up for this card due to the attractive sign up bonus. However, it seems like the sign up bonus is getting more difficult to earn as the spend requirement increases. Love their automatic transfer to KrisFlyer account :)"
3,"Had this card 2 years back when I first started my miles journey. Back then the signup promo was much better too, ~40,000 miles for $10,000 spend with hotel stay, etc. I never used the card after I fulfilled the conditions for the signup promo and eventually cancelled the card after a year. The signup promo got worst over the years and it is still not the general spending card one would use.  The best part is miles are automatically transferred to the KrisFlyer account, there is no need to pay additional fees to transfer."
3,I had this card for a long while. The good thing is that AMEX have been waiving my annual fees and that‚Äôs why I still have the card   Pros  1) Awesome customer service officers that are friendly and will do their best to help you. Follow ups are prompt as well  2) direct credit of miles to your Krisflyer account  3) Many small promos every few months  4) good sign up promo 5) no min spending  6) Concert lovers will love this one for the priority Amex provides to buy tickets   Cons  1) high annual fees  2) low earn rate for miles  Overall an ok card to hold on too. Good if you are a loyal Krisflyer fan that take SQ flights often.  If you don‚Äôt take SQ flights often the small promo and tie up with vendors like Grab and some shopping places will help rack up some miles 
3,"The company should spend more on the advertising, make more people know or aware of it. As currently the awareness are still Low."
4,"I signed up recently for the plan, the web interface was not the best and easiest to use. The information was not very organised but at least the data was decent when I connected to it so far. Will update again when I try it for longer. "
3,"I used 4 other local brokers before switching to POEMS around 1+ years ago.  Pros:  Can trade in much more overseas exchange markets especially in Southeast Asia.  Allows multiple asset class access besides Equities. Such as CFD, FX, Unit Trust and Insurance. Allows keeping multiple currencies deposit and pays slightly higher interest than banks.  The fees are reasonable. Have more reports, analysis, better charting tools. Allows Advanced Order types such as Stop Loss, Market Limit etc, which is crucial but are not available in those 4 other local brokers I have used. Can choose CDP account or Cash Account, which allows cheaper fees.  Cons:  The platform takes time to get used to. Not as user-friendly to navigate and somewhat messy. Occasionally it takes time to load and hang.  I am still using POEMs for SGX-listed and Southeast Asia-listed shares. Otherwise for other markets, I still prefer my other overseas broker due to more cheaper fees"
2,"I started my investment Journey with Poems first around 10 years ago before I switch platform  Pros: Allows you to trade, different type of investment assets  Cons: Poor user interface, currency are not converted automatically   Re-visited it 3 years ago, open account under my friend's name.  After going through its interface again, the same problems still remains. Therefore I did not use it, prefer my foreign brokerage accounts üôÇ"
4,"They have update the mobile apps, which is usefull for quick mobile trading. I think more importantly is you must have a good remiser. Do pm me for one, as my current remiser is good:) "
4,"Good prepaid account fees as compared to other platforms. Have used it for a while to buy dividend stocks (ie. STI index), simple to put in orders. They also offer free investment classes monthly at their different outlets where you can learn more about how to use the Phillip POEMS platform, or other beginner investment knowledge. "
2,"You can trade it for every shares you got however, the website is too complicated. There were missing functions and you have to find it yourself. There were too many steps. Not user-friendly"
2,"PROS:  - Zero commission for unit trusts, but I believe this is promotional, so enjoy while it last. Obviously they are fighting with FSM. Without this carrot, I will totally not use POEMs.  CONS:  - Worst website even with a 2.0 revamp in 2017. Very confusing, even for a simple action of withdrawing cash back to your bank. - To terminate a RSP, I have to submit a physical form "
4,"Among lot of Money Transfer Service Providers, choosing the best one is very difficult now a days. I am using SingX since it was first launched in Singapore & till now they have improved a lot in Money Transfer Services.  "
5,I found this remittance service on Google Ads on my gmail. Then i try to apply. Within the same day they engaged me with their agent. She helped me with the process and next day i am able to transfer money back to Malaysia d. Transfer is very easy to be done via their App and rate and fee are clearly stated. Please be aware dont transfer using manual way as they will have hard time to trace the transaction but their customer service really helps me to walkthrough it
5,"Have used the service twice in the past year for remitting SGD to INR and it remains by far the best rate in the market. The remittance is extremely easy, simply transfer your funds to the account shared and it's remitted instantly. I transferred the funds Monday morning and had the cash equivalent in my India account by the afternoon of the same day. Very transparent with regards to the rate and no hidden fees, happy to recommend this service to anyone out there looking for a cost effective and fast way to remit funds home"
4,"Among lot of Money Transfer Service Providers, choosing the best one is very difficult now a days. I am using SingX since it was first launched in Singapore & till now they have improved a lot in Money Transfer Services.  The transaction charges are very minimal & also the conversion charges i could say best as compare to other providers. Overall, I am happy to use there services as it complies with my money transfer needs. I do refer my friends to use SinX for money transfer as well. "
5,Great app interface! Data connection was extremely strong during a trip to China and connecting took less than 30 seconds. Much better than Starhub's prepaid data cards. Will definitely be using giga again for my next holiday.
4,Hello? Good branding much? I love giga colours and their animation! Really setting the bar high for other players out there. 
5,"Loved how seamless the onboarding process was. The entire process was done within the app and took me less than 5 minutes for me to complete my application. I also find the data and voice bundle to be one of the more competitive ones in the market with so many other brands in the mix. But what really stood out was the nice touch of engagement with their ""Friday happy hour"" perks with things like free data and vouchers! "
5,Great onboarding and good interface. Data connection seems to be really strong while overseas too. Branding is unique too!
5,Loving the app experience through and through. It's really easy to onboard and decent data offerings as well!
5,Best roaming rates. Best app experience. Love customizing my giga app. Did you know there‚Äôs even Spotify playlists curated for each giga character? And customer service is so dedicated they go above and beyond.  giga is truly the best mobile service provider you can find around town üëçüëç
1,"To cancel your line: Press the hamburger menu (bottom left) > SIM services > Cancel Line  --------  I just started using giga! will give it a few more days but I just found out that you can't share your hotspot to anyone, not even my kindle.   Anyway, I would have given it 1 star for my experience with the app when signing up for my number but the customer service staff, Jun Peng, was really understanding over email.   While signing up for my number the app crashed on me for about 10 times before I finally succeeded in choosing a mobile number of my choice. After going through all the nitty-gritty details and paying S$2 for the sim-card delivery.   I. Was. Not. Given. The. Number. I. Chose.   Heartbroken. I asked for a replacement but the delivery fee is non-refundable so I stuck to the random number that was given to me anyway. Will probably not continue after the trial. I can't even warn you to be SUPER careful when choosing your number - I literally typed out the number to choose the one and only option available and I didn't get it."
5,"giga is really a great and refreshing choice for those who prefer a no frills and no contract plan.   The 25GB of data is a good deal along with the 1000 minutes of outgoing calls and 1000 outgoing messages bundled with the plan.  Thank you giga for making available such an awesome mobile plan, cheers üòä"
5,"No seriously,  1000min out going? Call ur GF or mother till u Sian also enough  1000 SMS? Could text a one word reply without worrying 'lol' 'k can' bring back the old school texting days.  And the deal breaker... 25gb data with rollover. I been having 40- 50gb every month due to this roll over....  Plus u can receive call and sms free when overseas. I mean best deal liao!  I been on it from The beta till Now and I would say currently the best deal you can get. Don't believe me? Try it lo?   $25 with no lock down Nia don't like then changed other telco... But u will surely be back again. Confirm plus plus plus chop"
5,I love it!  It is highly self serviced in nature and much if not all of the information you will require can be found in the FAQ. Strongly recommended for those who are comfortable with skimming through the FAQ .  I love that the data bundle can be rolled over so I end up with 40+GB of data this month despite tethering !   Its value for money and fuss free. This is the perfect business model for my mobile needs.
5,Still an awesome brand coz it always remembers its own customers . Everything is in the app. Loving the Happy Hour Surprise ! Thank you giga!
5,"Experience has been amazing! Everything is controlled in the App; end to end. Love their colours and characters the most. Have tried their add on packs: WhatsApp, Insta n Fb and Jetset roaming, all have been above and beyond! In their words: giga-tastic! "
5,"I was with Starhub and I decided to go no-contract when that plan ended because I didn't need a new phone. There were a few no-contract plans to choose from but I eventually stayed with Starhub and signed up for giga! (Giga! is powered by Starhub like how circles runs on M1 infra)  Main reason for choosing giga! was its more convenient roaming arrangements.  My bill used to be about $50 monthly, but now it's halved as long as I don't use more than 25gb of data.  Very quick onboarding process, signed up one day and the friendly deliveryman came to my door with the SIM card the next day. After I switched over, I had about 3 weeks where my number showed up as ""private"" on caller IDs. Not sure why but now it's gone.  When I signed up for giga!, I just shifted home and the Wi-Fi wasn't up yet. So a large part of my 25gb went to casting shows on my TV. Such a luxury, considering my previous plan was just 6gb!   Contrary to Cherie's experience with hotspotting, mine went so well that I went abit overboard in my second month so I added 1gb for $2. And giga! decided to be generous a few days later on national day and gave everyone extra 5.4gb. So now I have that rolled over, meaning about 30gb for this billing month yay!  The app is really user-friendly, all it takes is to launch the app and with that one click I reach the dashboard showing me how much data I've used. If I wanna add on anything, I just click another button. Plus it has cute avatars that you can pick.  TBH now that my home WiFi is up, I kinda don't know how I'll use up so much data. But at least I never have to worry about not having enough data, and my phone bill is halved!"
5,"The previous plan I was using was MyRepublic. I was paying $35 monthly for just 12GB data. Network was not bad but their Roaming and others cost a lot compared to giga! I find giga so much better and perfect for my usage.  I'm so happy to be paying little for a data which is so much that will never ever exceed my usage for one whole month with free incoming, 1000 mins talk time and 1000 sms. 25GB for just $25 is really worth it! I save a lot!  Who will never enjoy this much of benefit for a little cost?! Value for money! I should say that customer service is really excellent and efficient. I have to just drop a message via online through the App. And within few MINUTES, they replied to my enquiry and there my doubt was cleared!  Network wise, is great; clear and also fast! I highly recommend this telco! No one will ever regret! VIVA LA GIGA! "
5,"Piggybacking on StarHub's infrastructure and network, giga! operates independently and offers a pretty compelling mobile plan. For 25GB of data, 1000 minutes of talktime, 1000 SMSes and free caller ID, it'll just cost you S$25 a month. ... More than that, giga! is the first telco to allow data rollover for two months."
5,"Been using giga for a couple of month now and I super love it. Love the roll over data! I‚Äôve been also using the roaming feature since I‚Äôve been in and out of Singapore and it never failed me even I‚Äôm out of the country. It‚Äôs very easy to use. And if I run out of data, I just go to the app and top up another gig. Very convenient. "
5,"Giga provides an almost-flawless service without considering the minor loss in network just occasionally. The roll-over data scheme is just a very smart initiative by Giga as users feel that every cent they paid for the service is worth the price, allowing us to fully maximise the data made available to us. Cheers!"
5,"I stay with Giga for good 3 reasons. Firstly, any problem I faced is quickly answered, in spite being a virtual operator. Secondly, no operator yet has a Roll Over Data. I can utilise my left over data without being forfeited. Lastly, 1000mins Talk Time & 1000 SMS are abundant. Very suitable for people with job involving outdoor. Keep up the Good Work, Giga !!!"
5,Everything can be done at the touch of your fingertips. Support is always there whether u need it or not. Unexpected rewards from time to time. Data is consistent throughout Singapore with hardly any blind spots. Calls are clear and crisp. Network signal is strong.  Break away from your telco contract chains and come to Giga. It's gigafantastic!
5,"i joined Giga recently and the experience has been great.  The app was easy to navigate and cute. Instructions on signing up, sim card delivery and porting in were fairly simple. there is a small delivery fee of $2 for sim card but you get to choose your preferred delivery address, date and time so that‚Äôs alright. my number was ported in on the same day which was a nice surprise!   network connection is still acceptable on trains or basements. also did a speed test, results were ok, maybe not the best but definitely not bad.    i was a long time subscriber with one of the 3 main telcos before i took the plunge and ended my contract early. had to pay a breakup fee but so far, it‚Äôs been worth it. "
5,I‚Äôm impressed by your new No-Contract service GIGA.  All I can say is thank you for the smooth transition. I was hopping telco between 3 telco before this and finally one that impresses me to stay!  Thank you GIGA!
5,"I'm in my second months with Giga. Connectivity is good. No-frill plan where you prepaid on a monthly basis. With the data rollover, you don't get a bill shock on data overusage. Definitely one of the best MVNO around! #Giga #Gigigaga"
5,"I've port in to Giga recently.Although there's some problem with the sim card when they first delivered,they send me the new SIM card on the day I report to them.By the way after I port over to Giga,the network speed is much much much better than my previous Telco.I highly recommend others to port in or sign up with Giga!Their CSO is the best than my previous Telco CSO.Viva la Giga!"
5,"switched to giga in June and other than a minor hiccup in recurring payment (provided a working credit card but somehow they couldn't deduct and my line was suspended for a few hours), everything else worked fine (LTE network, call receptions etc.)  happy with the data rollover as now I never have to worry about my data usage anymore.  keep up the good work giga!"
5,"Well Well Well... I can say that Giga's serious about business. Porting was damn fast. Tell me which Telco rollover data? And that too, 1000mins calls and sms too!!"
5,"Great new MVNO offering $25 for 25GB and rollover of 25GB of unused data. It also offers free incoming call, caller ID display, 1000 outgoing calls and 1000 sms.  I would say it's a very safe mobile plan as normal users probably never fully utilise the plan. Application and porting in was seamless. All in all not much complains.   Porting over was smooth sailing for me - it pays to read through all their FAQs as you get golden nuggets of information. It also helps to have another phone on standby to use with your old sim before the porting over begins!  It taps on Starhub's network coverage, people who are fussy about coverage have to take note.  Additionally, they frequently giveaway additional data too! Free 1GB FB and Insta pack when they hit 1000 followers on IG and 5.4GB free data for National Day ü•≥"
4,"I am currently with GIGA after trying gomo, circleslife, zero1. Why i stick with giga even though i can manage with the lesser talk time and sms of gomo for a smaller bill, was that the app was easy to use.  I still have Zero1, waiting for either GIGA or zero1 to improve their roaming options for me to finally stick to 1.  I would not mind paying more with no data pack for other countries, but sadly they do not even have that option.  Of course I can buy a data sim card at those country, but that's an extra hassle.  As for CirclesLife, I did not mind paying $30/month as it had quality roaming options.  Also it had a loyalty bonus, but sadly what made me left was that they discontinued it and thus i can't justify paying more (than GOMO or GIGA) for the lesser data.  As for GOMO, i ended up settling with GIGA which cost $5 more per month just because of the app. I have to switch off wifi every single time, which was frustrating."
2,"Giga is to be avoided if you travel. They don't have roaming. It means your phone is considered ""off"" once you're off the local network. For example, imagine you need to receive your bank OTP. You're screwed because there's no roaming. Imagine you are waiting for an urgent call on your SG number, tough luck.   That aside, as long as you don't mind your data connection breaking/disconnecting every time you get a call, it's generally fine."
5,I have been using Giga for about coming to 3 months now. What I enjoy the most would be the convenience of doing everything yourself AND the jetset giga. The cute and cool app is also definitely a plus point. Thumbs up so far. Cheers to more data!

4,Giga is user friendly and budget friendly data plan. Woudl reccomend it to others. The palns can be tailor made in accordance to the type of user.

5,"i switched over to giga! within the first month of its debut and it‚Äôs one of the best cost-savings decisions i‚Äôve made so far! i was busting my data plan at my previous mobile plan and my bill amounted up to $100 per month... that‚Äôs like 4 months worth of subscription of giga! so you can imagine how much i‚Äôm saving now.  not to mention the generous amount of data and the availability of rollover... it makes me feel v satisfied and ‚Äúsecure‚Äù when i know i have this excess amount, haha!  no regrets porting over to giga!"
5,"I came across Giga when I was doing research on the other SIM free telco when I decided to port out from my EX ~$30 per month.  I need more talk time (100 min not enough) and always need to pay excess and also could not bear the EX poor support, error prone billing and lack of usage details in the monthly billing. For SIM free post paid no contract, the best choice is M1 which is $25 for 30GB and 1000min talk time, but need to sign up online but their web page does not support port out from my EX to enjoy free registration and free SIM card.  I went to M1 shop and ask and they confirm no such benefit if sign up for the same thing in their shop.  So no deal for M1.  Circle life charge $18 first year and $28 after, 20GB data and 100 min talk, so it is no go also.  Ended up with Giga, $25 for 25GB data and 1000min talk, and can roll over the unused data portion, sign up online is easy and straight forward.  Ported over last month and got 5.4GB on national day promo. This month my quota ended up 40+ GB, and the 1000 min talk time also could not finish using both.  Very happy, with Giga, never worry about blowing up my bill at just $25 per month."
4,It was fuss free to switch to Giga. Now I don't have to worry about exceeding my data or talktime. Porting over was easily done over the app. 
5,"Pretty competitive prices but giga wins wth data rollover, awesome brand colours, vibes and a passionate team of people behind it."
5,"For people who needs a worthy way of paying their monthly phone line subscription, no matter how you compare the sim only plans offered by different telcos, GIGA always ends up winning as the MVP. (Most Valuable PLAN!) :) "
5,Switched over because of the $5.40 first month deal. Quick delivery of SIM card. Easy instructions and quick port over. 1st week in and connectivity is good! Rollover data is a plus! Worth ditching my ex üòõ
5,Awesome Network and calls which can support all phones. Fast delivery. Even more awesome with rollover data which keeps u data worry free! Will recommend to all my friends!!
5,This is my 3rd month with giga. The port over was really fast & smooth. No issues with connectivity so far. Now I have so much data that I don't need wifi anymore ü•∞
5,"I really like the giga app interface. So sleek and easy to use. Especially the data rollover so I never have to waste any unused data at all. No other telco gives me this, it's awesome! Pink and blue colours are so pleasing and I love the giga brand!"
4,"I ditched my (ex)-operator and never looked back.   Am together with Giga for about 3 months now. Giga is so much cheaper than the traditional mobile lines; with cheaper data cost that allows you to roll over any unused data to the following month! What‚Äôs more, it offers free caller ID, incoming calls and 1000mins (not sure who will i be calling but ya) call time with no string attached. üòè  Creating an account and porting over was easy as well. Customer officers were friendly and quite prompt when responding to your enquires through the app.   However, the coverage at certain locations can be better and the app can be quite laggy hence, when you are contacting the customer service for support or using the app, it is quite annoying.   Note: All customer services support will be through the app."
4,Signal coverage certainly can be improved. Sometimes when I was not even underground but the reception was quite bad. Customer service was great though because they were very responsive and responsible. Happy with giga overall so far  
4,"Just ported over less than a month ago. So far I'm loving it! Didn't have any problems porting my number over or ordering my new sim card.   I was debating between Giga and GOMO but eventually went with Giga because of the extra talk time and messages. Plus I've been using Singtel since forever and haven't had a very good experience with them in the past.  The only issue I faced with Giga was after activating my SIM card where I was not able to connect to the internet at all. My 4G was not even appearing on my phone. When I switched to 3G, I had very limited access to the internet.  Wrote in to their team and by the following day when I woke up, I was given clear instructions on the potential issues that I needed to fix. Plus point to Giga for having quick and clear customer service. But they could have been clearer when I activated the SIM card that I would need to change the data settings.   Overall, still loving this plan! Way better than my SIM-only plan with Singtel. It was way more expensive and had little hidden fees here and there which I wasn't able to cancel. "
2,Can not talk and use internet at the same time. I feel like I went 10 years back in time. Will do my month and switch back or go with GOMO.
1,"In consistent network speed, will have some lag during gaming like pubg or mobile legend. Not recommended to gamer. But normal surf net it's fine. No oversea outgoing call, a very disappointment."
