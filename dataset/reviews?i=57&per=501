If one is prepare to do the work to track your charges, this is actually a great card to have. Even better if you use this credit card and set up a UOB One account which gives a 2.43% pa interest for a saving balance of $50,000 if you meet the monthly minimum $500 credit card charge and 3 GIRO transactions requirement. \n\nIn my opinion, UOB One card is the card that keeps me on my edge as it can result in painful opportunity cost if you overlook any of its terms and conditions due to the quarterly cash rebate structure. By the time you found out about your oversight, you have already invested at least 3 months of your time and effort charging expenses to this card. Therefore, think and plan properly if you intend to use this card.\n","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":57,"name":"UOB One Card","description":null,"slug":"uob-one-cashback","details":{"meta":{"title":"UOB ONE Card | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the UOB ONE card, Credit Card via Seedly Reviews and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"UOB, ONE, credit card, singapore, personal finance, seedly, reviews, cashback, miles, Credit, Card"},"summary":[{"title":"Card Name","description":"UOB ONE Card"},{"title":"Cashback Rate","description":"3.3%-5%"},{"title":"Monthly Cashback Cap","description":"$50/ $100/ $300 per quarter"},{"title":"Monthly Min Spend","description":"$500/ $1,000/ $2,000"},{"title":"Highlights","description":"UOB One bank account holders, large payments (eg wedding, renovation)"}],"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/credit/one/"}]},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/615/original/1250dde9fec52aedbfe5f3e2dfbfe768c5b6c697.?1559895271","alias":"UOB One Card","categoryId":4,"companyId":12,"rating":4.3,"ratingsCount":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":6,"4":10,"5":17},"reviewsCount":33},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":36081,"name":"Adela Chew","slug":"adela-chew","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/10155788070302763/picture","answersCount":1,"upvotesCount":1,"reviewsCount":3,"badges":null}},{"id":1023,"text":"Perfect for me with UOB One.
