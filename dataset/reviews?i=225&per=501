They have an office in Singapore and a staff who is ready to answer my questions (Thanks JQ!!)\n\nAnd because they are very anti-money laundering, there are some minor inconveniences like having to verify that I’m a real person (via a quick webcam call). And I have to send documents showing that I’m sending salary to my staff, as a one-off check. But because of this, I am certain these due diligences will ensure my account with them is safe - and my account won’t get suspended/frozen for no reason.\n\nFor online businesses that use USD as their main currency, I would strongly recommend WorldFirst.","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":225,"name":"WorldFirst","description":"","slug":"worldfirst","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.worldfirst.com/en-sg/?ID=5840?"}],"summary":[{"title":"Remittance Service","description":"WorldFirst"},{"title":"Registration Fee","description":"Free"},{"title":"Transaction Fee","description":"Free for personal transfers\nSmall fee for business transfers (depending on transfer amount)"},{"title":"Countries You Can Transfer To","description":"Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Oceania"}],"meta":{"title":"WorldFirst | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about WorldFirst remittance and money transfer services via Seedly Reviews and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"WorldFirst, remittance, money transfer platform, exchange rate, customer care, promotions, seedly, reviews, send money overseas"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/003/223/original/83519870a18b6b0b9aa6648a917918090a5fe32f.png?1565257128","alias":"WorldFirst","categoryId":8,"companyId":220,"rating":4.9,"ratingsCount":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":3,"5":39},"reviewsCount":42},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":89837,"name":"Tay Yeng Hwee","slug":"tay-yeng-hwee","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/10156784129702123/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":0,"reviewsCount":0,"badges":null}},{"id":5949,"text":"A very user-friendly platform and professional service.
