Anda boleh memilih antara Fixed Ohm atau Discount Ohm. Saya memilih Discount Ohm kerana ada kemungkinan tarif akan turun. Fixed Ohm juga sangat baik, dan lebih menguntungkan sekiranya tarif meningkat. Manfaat Ohm: Diskaun mereka pada tarif sekarang adalah yang terbaik, iaitu pada kadar 25%. Peralihan juga sangat lancar kerana mereka adalah rakan kongsi dengan kumpulan SP. Sebagai contoh, tidak memerlukan sebarang dokumen atau bayaran tambahan. Laman web mereka juga sangat baik. Pendaftaran sangat mudah dengan hanya mengisi beberapa butiran peribadi secara dalam talian, dan anda akan menerima e-mel dalam tempoh 15 minit atau kurang. Ohm menyerap \"transmission loss\". (Pada asasnya, tenaga elektrik hilang sebagai haba semasa perjalanan melalui kabel, Ohm menyerap ini dan mengenakan pengguna berdasarkan penggunaan meter. Ini bernilai kira-kira 3.4% penjimatan.) Tempoh percubaan untuk Ohm ialah 3 bulan. Jika dalam masa 3 bulan anda memutuskan untuk menukar rancangan, anda tidak akan dikenakan penalti. Oleh itu, anda tidak terikat pada harga tetap. Kadar Tetap berbanding Tarif Diskaun Pada masa ini, kadar Fixed Ohm adalah 17.98 sen/kWh (termasuk GST) manakala dengan adanya diskaun untuk tarif (25%) kadarnya ialah 19.14 sen/kWh (termasuk GST). Tarif elektrik mulai 1 Jan hingga 31 Mac 2019 adalah 25.52 sen/kWh (termasuk GST). Bagaimanapun, tidak mustahil tarif SP turun. Sekiranya tarif SP turun, katakan kepada 20.20 (tidak termasuk GST) harga Jan 2017, maka Tarif Diskaun 25% akan berkuat kuasa 16.21 sen/kWh (termasuk GST) yang mengalahkan kadar tetap! (20.20 x 1.07 x 0.75 = 16.21) Tiada siapa yang dapat memastikan sama ada tarif SP akan jatuh kerana ia bergantung kepada banyak faktor yang rumit termasuk harga minyak, dan lain-lain. Walau bagaimanapun, kini dengan 12 pembekal elektrik di negara kecil seperti Singapura, terdapat banyak persaingan, dan SP mungkin akan menurunkan harga untuk kekal berdaya saing. Kesimpulan: Pilihlah Ohm Semua orang harus menukar pembekal di pasaran elektrik terbuka untuk berjimat. Tiada kerugian untuk berbuat demikian. Khususnya, tidak perlu bimbang tentang \"blackouts\" atau \"bekalan elektrik yang tidak boleh dipercayai\" kerana kumpulan SP masih mengendalikan grid kuasa negara.","createdByCurrentUser":false,"product":{"categorySlug":"open-electricity-market","productSlug":"ohm-electricity"},"user":{"id":56464,"name":"Farhan Rasam","slug":"farhan-rasam","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/2217561118517875/picture"}},{"id":6620,"createdAt":"2019-07-11T15:47:32.073+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-07-11T15:47:32.073+08:00","isAnonymous":false,"commentableId":1788,"commentText":"Hi there!

This is important for my parents as they would not want another bill to complicate payment! This was a huge deal breaker for me actually, almost all the other retailers come as a separate bill. - No other fees, Ohm absorbs all the carbon tax and transmission loss fee, almost the same as other retailers. No security deposit needed as well - I got the fixed rate of $0.1798/kWh for 2 years plan (also almost same as other retailers). SP Group current rate is $0.2552/kWh, so already discounted about 30%. - They have 3 months trial - that means if you choose not to continue within 3 mths, you can cancel without any termination fee. This is the ONLY retailer that offers this! - **Referral programme. I have a few friends using Ohm as well, and I used their referral to get $20 rebate. likewise, you can use my referral code and we both will get $20 rebate too. and it's UNLIMITED! Which means once you get your referral code and your friends/neighbours sign up for Ohm using your code, you will get $20 rebate/sign up. - I signed today (2 Jan 2019) as they extended their current promo of 25% off second bill, till end of 2 Jan 2019. It was already all redeemed by 12pm today! The earlier promos were much better like 50% off 2nd and 3rd bill but it was already redeemed by 1 Jan 4.30am lol - Fuss free registration, literally just took 5 mins online!
