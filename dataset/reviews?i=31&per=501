Unfortunately, I've accidentally dropped my camera before departure at Changi Airport(note: it is still covered in the policy as the policy covers the minute you leave home for the trip)  and sent it for repair. The camera repair shop told me that most of his customer sent in to repair. \n\nWe decided to try our luck to claim from FWD. The claims department (from another department) decided to reject our claim and giving us the reason as \"negligence\". We know that it is our fault but it defeats the purpose of the clause \"accident\". \n\nI then went to re-read the clauses in each of the policy, taking note of the terms they used and the definition together with any general exclusion. What I found was that accident is defined as \"unintentional\", which I thought that it was just another term of \"negligence\".  My case has also not been excluded in any of the general exclusion. \n\nI have decided to write an appeal letter to the CEO of FWD (based on what was suggested in the travel policy). To my amazed, FWD processed my claim 3 days later and told me that they will issue the cheque to my house.

Unfortunately, I've accidentally dropped my camera before departure at Changi Airport(note: it is still covered in the policy as the policy covers the minute you leave home for the trip)  and sent it for repair. The camera repair shop told me that most of his customer sent in to repair. \n\nWe decided to try our luck to claim from FWD. The claims department (from another department) decided to reject our claim and giving us the reason as \"negligence\". We know that it is our fault but it defeats the purpose of the clause \"accident\". \n\nI then went to re-read the clauses in each of the policy, taking note of the terms they used and the definition together with any general exclusion. What I found was that accident is defined as \"unintentional\", which I thought that it was just another term of \"negligence\".
