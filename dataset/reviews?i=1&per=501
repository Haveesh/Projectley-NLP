Since then, we have actually used this as training and have improved the quality of our answers.  We strive to provide detailed answers both qualitatively and quantitatively, even if the calculations are manual. \n\nA time series plot does take some time for us as we have to either get the data from the tech team or to look for the daily EOD NAV and then plot it. We do not currently have this data readily available in an exportable format, but we are working on this and it is the pipeline for us.\n\nWe do understand your disappointment with the performance of your portfolio. As mentioned by my colleague in your email correspondence, your returns actually exceeded the expected return of the risk profile you selected at the end of January. However, the market correction in February did negatively affect your returns (my colleague provided the actual returns in that email) but our risk management framework works to ensure that we protect our clients' capital in those times.\n\nMarket corrections typically only last a few weeks and should not affect medium to long term investors asset allocation. Our investment framework does contain a risk management component that would be activated should data show that a sell off is more than a temporary correction.\n\nWe do recommend staying invested over the long-term. If there are unrealized losses on assets during a market correction, in theory, selling these assets may realize the paper losses. Maintaining a long-term perspective, investing steadily and consistently into a diversified portfolio, and sticking to a disciplined investment plan are the key principles for successful investing. Following these principles regardless of market conditions will have a bigger influence on your long-term returns.\n\nI hope i was able to provide some insights on your returns and if you'd like, I would appreciate the opportunity to speak to you over our handling of your queries in the past. Once again, thank you for your feedback, Ankita, and if you would like to discuss further on any of these points, please feel free to reach out to us and i'd would be happy to schedule a call to take you through any of your questions or concerns. \n\nBest,\nAmanda","createdByCurrentUser":false,"product":{"categorySlug":"robo-advisors","productSlug":"stashaway"},"user":{"id":44641,"name":"Amanda Ong","slug":"amanda-ong-3d82d5a8-d0a7-428a-b3c3-f4f5b321acd6","image":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/001/733/square/dc3b897eaa3218057ca64d7093ff4c3ac9354947.jpg?1557803976"}},{"id":4944,"createdAt":"2018-09-21T10:08:08.621+08:00","updatedAt":"2018-09-21T10:10:39.118+08:00","isAnonymous":false,"commentableId":87,"commentText":"Hi Ankita, thank you for your genuine sharing.

It can happen daily, weekly or monthly. It is done automatically by our technology that monitors your portfolio in real time.\n\nRe-optimization, on the other hand, change the asset allocation by recommending new ETFs for the portfolio(s), due to change in economic regimes. This means your portfolio(s) may now contain existing ETFs with a different weightage and new ETFs.\n\nTherefore, rebalancing is done automatically while you have the option to opt out of auto re-optimization.","createdByCurrentUser":false,"product":{"categorySlug":"robo-advisors","productSlug":"stashaway"},"user":{"id":32615,"name":"HK Guo","slug":"hk-guo","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/10215466017104533/picture"}}],"commentsCount":4,"product":{"id":1,"name":"StashAway","description":null,"slug":"stashaway","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.stashaway.sg/"},{"name":"promocodequestion","value":"https://seedly.sg/questions/anyone-willing-to-share-your-stashaway-referral-code"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"MAS Capital Market Services Licence (CMS100604-1)"},{"title":"Methodology","description":"Economic Regime-based Asset Allocation (ERAA)"},{"title":"Fees","description":"Between 0.8% to 0.2% of total invested per year"},{"title":"Minimum","description":"No minimum to start"}],"meta":{"title":"Stashaway Robo-Advisor - Investing, redefined | Seedly Reviews","description":"Read real user reviews about the team, fees, investment strategy, operations and minimum investment for robo-advisor Stashaway, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"reviews, feedbacks, comparison, robo-investing, best robo, robo financial, automated investment, robo Advisor, stashaway, seedly"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/559/original/a21e688dc26602a16487752905909d2d251e25cd.?1559893224","alias":"StashAway","categoryId":10,"companyId":1,"rating":4.6,"ratingsCount":{"1":2,"2":2,"3":5,"4":20,"5":78},"reviewsCount":107},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":22097,"name":"HC Tang","slug":"hc-tang","image":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/000/123/medium/4cac23074e58940b8bbcd7275f01654103510f97.jpeg?1537777874","answersCount":490,"upvotesCount":612,"reviewsCount":24,"badges":null}},{"id":9,"text":"Pros:\n- Fractional shares: every single cent is being invested (make all your money work for you)\n- Investment framework which differentiates themselves from other robo-advisors (do spend some time to understand it, how the different regime would change the portfolio allocation, how is the portfolio being reoptimized/rebalanced)\n- Actively engaging the public (talks and monthly CIO updates article)\n- Excellent customer support\n- Nice and clean UI\n- The convenience of a mobile application\n- No minimum amount required to invest (event student drawing pocket money can do it!)\n- Cheap for a hassle free investment service that provides diversification (as compared to unit trusts/mutual funds and diversifying/rebalancing the portfolio yourself is not going to be cost-effective unless the amount is large)\n\nCons:\n- Limited visibility into the transactions in the UI (everything can be found in the monthly statement but that requires the user to wait a few weeks for it)\n- Exchange rate (SGD deposit to USD) cannot be found in the UI or monthly statement (this can be reversed/computed from the USD cash flow in the monthly statement)\n\nAlthough I find the cons pretty annoying (could be just me), I believe the pros outweigh the cons, hence the 5 stars review.

This is something that we often recommend to our clients\n\nMarket timing is very difficult to achieve- in fact, research has shown that market timing can be detrimental to your long-term investment performance.\nStudies found that almost all big stock market gains and drops are concentrated in just a few trading days each year (https://www.ifa.com/12steps/step4/missing_the_best_and_worst_days). Missing only a few days can have a dramatic impact on returns. \n\nFor example, between 1994 and 2013, just missing the 20 best days of the S\u0026P 500 would have eroded 67% of your returns. As the best days and worst days of the market are equally concentrated, timing the market can be a perilous proposition, and may be detrimental to your long term returns.\n\nAnother academic study (http://blog.iese.edu/jestrada/files/2012/06/BSMTDow.pdf) examined the probability that market timing can benefit investors' returns. Examining the Dow from 1900–2006 shows that \"a few outliers have a massive impact on long-term performance. Missing the best 10 days resulted in portfolios 65% less valuable than a passive investment and avoiding the worst 10 days resulted in portfolios 206% more valuable than a passive investment. Given that 10 days represent 0.03% of the days in the sample, the odds against successful market timing are staggering.\"\n\nThis is an article we have written on thinking through dollar cost averaging that you might find useful as well: https://www.stashaway.sg/r/dollar-cost-averaging\n\nIf you do find that your risk level is set too high, you can adjust your risk level at any time you wish. It is important that you select a risk level that is in line with your risk appetite and does not keep you up at night.\n\nIf you’d like, we would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding your portfolio’s returns. Once again, thank you for your feedback, Nicholas, and if you would like to discuss further on any of these points, please feel free to reach out to us.","createdByCurrentUser":false,"product":{"categorySlug":"robo-advisors","productSlug":"stashaway"},"user":{"id":44641,"name":"Amanda Ong","slug":"amanda-ong-3d82d5a8-d0a7-428a-b3c3-f4f5b321acd6","image":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/001/733/square/dc3b897eaa3218057ca64d7093ff4c3ac9354947.jpg?1557803976"}}],"commentsCount":2,"product":{"id":1,"name":"StashAway","description":null,"slug":"stashaway","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.stashaway.sg/"},{"name":"promocodequestion","value":"https://seedly.sg/questions/anyone-willing-to-share-your-stashaway-referral-code"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"MAS Capital Market Services Licence (CMS100604-1)"},{"title":"Methodology","description":"Economic Regime-based Asset Allocation (ERAA)"},{"title":"Fees","description":"Between 0.8% to 0.2% of total invested per year"},{"title":"Minimum","description":"No minimum to start"}],"meta":{"title":"Stashaway Robo-Advisor - Investing, redefined | Seedly Reviews","description":"Read real user reviews about the team, fees, investment strategy, operations and minimum investment for robo-advisor Stashaway, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"reviews, feedbacks, comparison, robo-investing, best robo, robo financial, automated investment, robo Advisor, stashaway, seedly"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/559/original/a21e688dc26602a16487752905909d2d251e25cd.?1559893224","alias":"StashAway","categoryId":10,"companyId":1,"rating":4.6,"ratingsCount":{"1":2,"2":2,"3":5,"4":20,"5":78},"reviewsCount":107},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":47699,"name":"Nicholas Chan","slug":"nicholas-chan-d0f3c1fd-2fbc-4ae4-ac2d-18b8e01559df","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/10216303396078268/picture","answersCount":176,"upvotesCount":88,"reviewsCount":2,"badges":null}},{"id":89,"text":"Stashaway was extremely easy to set up.

For example, in recessions, investment grade bonds tend to perform better than equities. Our Investment framework takes into account what economic regime we are in as well as whether an asset class is over or under-valued. You can read the full white paper here (https://www.stashaway.sg/r/stashaways-asset-allocation-framework) where we discuss how we allocate to asset classes depending on the economic regime the data points indicate, as well as how we look to optimize valuation gaps.\n\nIn times of recession, we will not necessarily move you entirely away from equities. There are certain sectors within equities such as consumer staples (considered a more protective sector) that do tend to outperform other asset classes like consumer discretionary. Hence, we will shift your allocation towards these more protective asset classes such as consumer staples, gold, government bonds etc.\n\nI hope this clarifies, Anan :) If you have any further questions, please feel free to WhatsApp us at +65 9467 2416, email us at support@stashaway.sg or call us at 6248 0889.","createdByCurrentUser":false,"product":{"categorySlug":"robo-advisors","productSlug":"stashaway"},"user":{"id":44641,"name":"Amanda Ong","slug":"amanda-ong-3d82d5a8-d0a7-428a-b3c3-f4f5b321acd6","image":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/001/733/square/dc3b897eaa3218057ca64d7093ff4c3ac9354947.jpg?1557803976"}}],"commentsCount":3,"product":{"id":1,"name":"StashAway","description":null,"slug":"stashaway","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.stashaway.sg/"},{"name":"promocodequestion","value":"https://seedly.sg/questions/anyone-willing-to-share-your-stashaway-referral-code"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"MAS Capital Market Services Licence (CMS100604-1)"},{"title":"Methodology","description":"Economic Regime-based Asset Allocation (ERAA)"},{"title":"Fees","description":"Between 0.8% to 0.2% of total invested per year"},{"title":"Minimum","description":"No minimum to start"}],"meta":{"title":"Stashaway Robo-Advisor - Investing, redefined | Seedly Reviews","description":"Read real user reviews about the team, fees, investment strategy, operations and minimum investment for robo-advisor Stashaway, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"reviews, feedbacks, comparison, robo-investing, best robo, robo financial, automated investment, robo Advisor, stashaway, seedly"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/559/original/a21e688dc26602a16487752905909d2d251e25cd.?1559893224","alias":"StashAway","categoryId":10,"companyId":1,"rating":4.6,"ratingsCount":{"1":2,"2":2,"3":5,"4":20,"5":78},"reviewsCount":107},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":56366,"name":"Arushi Datta","slug":"arushi-datta","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/10156372001608649/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":1,"reviewsCount":1,"badges":null}},{"id":84,"text":"Tbh I chose StashAway from all the 3 due to the associated fees with respect to my monthly contribution amounts.\n\nSet up was a breeze and way easier than axxx wxxxxx. \n\nTheir methodology  suits my preference, risk appetite and time I am willing to spend to gain overseas exposure. \n\nI have not been disappointed so far, the returns are currently at an impressive 5.3% given that I only started in March 2018. \n\nOverall, its an easy and relatively cheap way to gain overseas exposure. \n\nChecking back in 10 years ;) \n\n","rating":5,"itemId":1,"createdAt":"2018-07-10T13:20:55.838+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-06-13T12:47:24.335+08:00","category":{"id":10,"slug":"robo-advisors"},"reviewText":"Tbh I chose StashAway from all the 3 due to the associated fees with respect to my monthly contribution amounts.\n\nSet up was a breeze and way easier than axxx wxxxxx. \n\nTheir methodology  suits my preference, risk appetite and time I am willing to spend to gain overseas exposure. \n\nI have not been disappointed so far, the returns are currently at an impressive 5.3% given that I only started in March 2018. \n\nOverall, its an easy and relatively cheap way to gain overseas exposure. \n\nChecking back in 10 years ;) \n\n","upvotesCount":1,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[{"id":4941,"createdAt":"2018-09-08T18:03:40.455+08:00","updatedAt":"2018-09-08T18:03:51.097+08:00","isAnonymous":false,"commentableId":84,"commentText":"Can elaborate more on overseas exposure?

So based on my short returns on stashaway, the annual return would probably be 2-3% at best (which is still better than the rates from savings account). \n\nIn 2017 - REITs gives an average of 6-8% dividend, excluding the capital gain.\nIn 2017 - STI grew 20+% \nIn 2017 - Tech stock boomed so if you invested some in stocks like facebook, google, amazon, nvidia, paypal etc etc (just any names) you would have seen 40 - 100% capital gain.\n\nof course there are cryptocurrencies too. \n\nBecause it's still a bull market now, the returns for roboadvisors really pale in comparison with reits / stocks / cryptocurrency. \n\nLike even now, if you are a risk taker, you can just buy a bit of tech stocks (although they are in their all time high), and should still be able to see at least a 2-3% growth in 1 month. If market continue to rise until end of 2018, i think it is possible to see at least 20% capital gain by EOY. (but this is pure gut feeling and has no financial basis / technical / fundamental analysis whatsoever).\n\nThat said, i acknowledge the fact that roboadvisors are suitable for passive investors and the returns will only be visible over a long time period.

We fully understand your disappointment with your returns: it’s a sentiment which echoes that of many invested in the markets since the start of 2018. 2018 has been a tough year for investors, with 2 market corrections wiping out YTD gains for investors: the S\u0026P 500, a common benchmark index used to track the US market, posted an annualised loss of -6.69%.\nOur CIO, Freddy, released an article discussing the current market outlook. You can read the article at the link below. \nhttps://www.stashaway.sg/r/reviewing-2018-and-anticipating-2019\n\nWe promise it will be informative!\n\nOur portfolios are designed for medium to long term investment, which is generally a timeline of at least 3-5 years. We do maintain our recommendation for customers to adopt a long-term perspective to investing and avoid being alarmed by short term fluctuations in the market. \n\nIf you’d like, we would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding your portfolio’s returns. Once again, thank you for your feedback, Stefano, and if you would like to discuss further on any of these points, please feel free to reach out to us at support@stashaway.sg or call us at +65 6248 0889 (9am - 6pm, Monday - Friday, excluding SG public holidays).","createdByCurrentUser":false,"product":{"categorySlug":"robo-advisors","productSlug":"stashaway"},"user":{"id":44641,"name":"Amanda Ong","slug":"amanda-ong-3d82d5a8-d0a7-428a-b3c3-f4f5b321acd6","image":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/001/733/square/dc3b897eaa3218057ca64d7093ff4c3ac9354947.jpg?1557803976"}}],"commentsCount":1,"product":{"id":1,"name":"StashAway","description":null,"slug":"stashaway","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.stashaway.sg/"},{"name":"promocodequestion","value":"https://seedly.sg/questions/anyone-willing-to-share-your-stashaway-referral-code"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"MAS Capital Market Services Licence (CMS100604-1)"},{"title":"Methodology","description":"Economic Regime-based Asset Allocation (ERAA)"},{"title":"Fees","description":"Between 0.8% to 0.2% of total invested per year"},{"title":"Minimum","description":"No minimum to start"}],"meta":{"title":"Stashaway Robo-Advisor - Investing, redefined | Seedly Reviews","description":"Read real user reviews about the team, fees, investment strategy, operations and minimum investment for robo-advisor Stashaway, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"reviews, feedbacks, comparison, robo-investing, best robo, robo financial, automated investment, robo Advisor, stashaway, seedly"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/559/original/a21e688dc26602a16487752905909d2d251e25cd.?1559893224","alias":"StashAway","categoryId":10,"companyId":1,"rating":4.6,"ratingsCount":{"1":2,"2":2,"3":5,"4":20,"5":78},"reviewsCount":107},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":55754,"name":"Stefano Ganassi","slug":"stefano-ganassi","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/10217151233160132/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":0,"reviewsCount":1,"badges":null}},{"id":83,"text":"Easy to start with for beginners. 5 mths now and the return is about 5.6% with currency impact.
