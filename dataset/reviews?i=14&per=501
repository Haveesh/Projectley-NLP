{"code":"ok","data":[{"id":369,"text":"I have been using the SCB Bonus Saver since i graduated and started working in August 2017. I understand that most people prefer to stick to DBS or use OCBC 360 because it is one of the more popular and safer options out there. But upon careful research, i realised that the SCB Bonus$aver has one of the most attractive bonus interest rates out there and would like to leave a positive but neutral review to educate fellow Seedly users.\n\nCurrently, i am getting 1.88% with the SCB and this 1.88% stems from a 1% salary credit (which incidentally must be more than $3000 credited with a SAL code, your HR employer will know what this is.), a 0.78% card spend (all Mastercard Or Paypass spend, NETS and Transitlink expenditure is NOT included.) as well as the prevailing base interest of 0.1% (this means that lest you are unable to qualify for the salary credit and card spend, you will only qualify for a paltry 0.10%.)\n\nI do not have 3 bills monthly to pay hence i am missing out on a further 0.25% (3 bills of $50 each.) and could be earning up to 2.13% (1.88%+0.25%). However, assuming i have a monthly credit card bill as well as a phone bill/internet bill to pay, this will be attainable in the near future.\n\nExplaining further in depth, i understand that the 1% salary credit as well as the requirement to take home $3000, which requires a gross pay of around $3750 and above might be unattainable for fresh graduates, yet the unique selling factor for me is the 0.78% that you can qualify for from simply spending 500 dollars monthly. This can be achieved by offering to pay for your meals with friends or families, by inculcating a good habit of using your VISA/MASTERCARD wherever you go and only using cash when absolutely necessary. \n\nWith insurance companies offering 3 year endowment plans in the range of 2-2.5%, i highly rate the 1.88%-2.13% that can be obtained, coupled with the instant liquidity of having these funds inside your Bonus$aver should you require to take out money for investment or insurance payment purposes.\n\nMoreover, you can also sign up for the SCB Online Banking which has cheaper brokerage costs as it does not have a CDP account (instead it uses SC's own custodian). This helps to have both your Bonus$aver account as well as trading securities on a single Banking App, as well as for internal transfers. I am someone who prefers having as minimal cards as possible to give myself greater convenience instead of tracking various cards to see if i have qualified for the respective criteria monthly, and recommend the SCB Bonus$aver to both credit your salary as well as spend on it.","rating":5,"itemId":14,"createdAt":"2018-01-24T21:30:01.667+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-06-13T12:47:24.673+08:00","category":{"id":5,"slug":"savings-accounts"},"reviewText":"I have been using the SCB Bonus Saver since i graduated and started working in August 2017.
