We strictly adhere to the regulations and guidelines imposed by the Authorities. :) If you're able to recall, perhaps you can let us know who's the person that you spoke to so that our team can further improve.\n\nSeedIn's move to disengage its Escrow agent was because we had gathered the feedback of the investors and we acknowledge the frustrations regarding the turnaround time required for the transfer of funds which can be lengthy, resulting in a missed opportunity for potential deals. To resolve this, approval from the regulators was obtained for SeedIn to establish a clients' account with a licensed bank, to seamlessly manage and facilitate funds movement between Investors and Borrowers specifically. SeedIn acts upon the top up, withdrawal, disbursement and repayments instructions. Funds are separated from her own operational monies. SeedIn has segregation duties over the management of accounts. At no point in time will a staff be able to transact a transaction without a second level of check and approval. The dual control required to initiate and approve the movement of funds in the clients' account is logged for audit trail. The trails and settlements will be audited by our in house compliance team as well an external auditor. Audits will ensure that processes are abided and funds are accounted for accordingly.\n\nAll relevant disclosure and statistics are updated regularly on a yearly basis in accordance to MAS requirement. \n\nAlso, SeedIn do not charge any fees for withdrawals. Perhaps you've mixed up our platform with others. \n\nLastly, the exact sms that we sent out for Seedly Reviews Campaign was as follows: \n\n\"Dear ________, stand a chance to win $50 CapitaLand Vouchers when you leave a review of our platform here: bit.ly/2ksVY7u. Giveaway ends 16/09. - Team SeedIn\"\n\nThere was no mention at all of having the need for members to leave a 'favourable' reply. 😅\n\nThe sms was sent via an SMS platform called ReplyX of which they also count Land Transport Authority (LTA), National Environment Agency (NEA)  \u0026 National Kidney Foundation (NKF) as their clients. \n\nMun Choong, we hope the above clarifies, please do not hesitate to contact us at +65 6916 1799 should you have any further questions or feedback! \n\nAnd we have a deal going live today! Trust that you had received the notification email yesterday. Do log in to check it out! \n\nCheers! 😊\n\nSummer Joy Lee,\nCustomer Happiness Officer","createdByCurrentUser":false,"product":{"categorySlug":"p2p-lending","productSlug":"seedin"},"user":{"id":87355,"name":"SeedIn Singapore","slug":"seedin-singapore","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/100751024655406/picture"}}],"commentsCount":1,"product":{"id":203,"name":"SeedIn","description":null,"slug":"seedin","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://sg.seedin.tech/?utm_source=seedly\u0026utm_medium=review\u0026utm_campaign=referral"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Loan agreements in place"},{"title":"Methodology","description":"Business Term"},{"title":"Fees","description":" 15% on interest earned"},{"title":"Minimum","description":"The minimum investment amount per crowdfunding pledge is S$1,000"},{"title":"Default Rate","description":"0% (Late repayment of more than 90 days)"}],"meta":{"title":"SeedIn P2P Lending - Take Your Business Further | Seedly Reviews","description":"Read real user reviews about the team, fees, default rate, method and minimum investment for P2P platform SeedIn, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"crowdfunding singapore, peer to peer lending, sme loans, business loans, business finance, p2p lending, seedly, seedin"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/761/original/e0c3c19e6d2dcd7bff4a50557ccf695b4c6b8157.?1559895394","alias":"SeedIn","categoryId":11,"companyId":203,"rating":4.8,"ratingsCount":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3,"4":13,"5":69},"reviewsCount":85},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":87341,"name":"Mun Choong Cheong","slug":"mun-choong-cheong","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/459835871533841/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":1,"reviewsCount":1,"badges":null}},{"id":4507,"text":"Having a passive income is what everyone dreams and works towards.
