It wasn't until circa. June 2019 that it dawned on me that the following two things were missing in my investment agenda:\n\n1) A trading system, especially a highly executable analytical framework which tells me precisely and concisely which stocks to buy and why (both from a qualitative and quantitative perspective) and when when to exit; \n\n2) A like-minded trader community which focuses on fundamental analysis.\n\nDespite the pretty handsome fees for the i3 course, if you are also in search for the two items above, it is a price worth paying. Arguably, one could figure out a fundamental-based trading system just through patient and thorough reading of the fundamental analysis (\"FA\") literature which is widely available. I beg to differ that a lot of books on FA out there, whilst brimming with wise advice, those advice come too general. Also, lets face it, the FA literature has been lacking in instructional guides which could inspire readers to take immediate action. \n\nI personally feel Dr Wealth has done the FA community and believers in FA a great service by plugging the gap. Having said the above, I believe the real value gems are Alvin and Louis themselves. Surprisingly enough, both of them come across as down to earth folks, which are extremely rare in the bubbly retail investor community, where people (and especially trainers) are fist/chest pumping and cheerleading too much.\n\nPersonally, I was very much assured by Alvin's equanimous and matter-of-factedly attitude when he was conducting classes. He definitely knows his material inside out (evident from how he never brushed over any questions and always answers comprehensively), and appeared to be always calm and not easily excitable, which again, is hard to find in today's society.\n\nWhilst folks who are well versed with financial and investing knowledge might find the i3 course rudimentary, nevertheless, if you have been searching for a highly actionable FA framework, and looking to acquaint yourself with practical tutors in Alvin and Louis, why not keep an open mind, attend this course, and put in the hard work afterwards with much more clarity and confidence.  (Quick note: If you are a technical analysis junkie, this might not be a course for you).","rating":5,"itemId":82,"createdAt":"2019-09-29T21:38:27.096+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-09-29T21:38:27.096+08:00","category":{"id":14,"slug":"investment-courses"},"reviewText":"Despite being fairly well exposed to financial knowledge, I consider myself a novice when it comes to stock investing. It wasn't until circa. June 2019 that it dawned on me that the following two things were missing in my investment agenda:\n\n1) A trading system, especially a highly executable analytical framework which tells me precisely and concisely which stocks to buy and why (both from a qualitative and quantitative perspective) and when when to exit; \n\n2) A like-minded trader community which focuses on fundamental analysis.\n\nDespite the pretty handsome fees for the i3 course, if you are also in search for the two items above, it is a price worth paying. Arguably, one could figure out a fundamental-based trading system just through patient and thorough reading of the fundamental analysis (\"FA\") literature which is widely available. I beg to differ that a lot of books on FA out there, whilst brimming with wise advice, those advice come too general. Also, lets face it, the FA literature has been lacking in instructional guides which could inspire readers to take immediate action. \n\nI personally feel Dr Wealth has done the FA community and believers in FA a great service by plugging the gap. Having said the above, I believe the real value gems are Alvin and Louis themselves. Surprisingly enough, both of them come across as down to earth folks, which are extremely rare in the bubbly retail investor community, where people (and especially trainers) are fist/chest pumping and cheerleading too much.\n\nPersonally, I was very much assured by Alvin's equanimous and matter-of-factedly attitude when he was conducting classes. He definitely knows his material inside out (evident from how he never brushed over any questions and always answers comprehensively), and appeared to be always calm and not easily excitable, which again, is hard to find in today's society.\n\nWhilst folks who are well versed with financial and investing knowledge might find the i3 course rudimentary, nevertheless, if you have been searching for a highly actionable FA framework, and looking to acquaint yourself with practical tutors in Alvin and Louis, why not keep an open mind, attend this course, and put in the hard work afterwards with much more clarity and confidence.  (Quick note: If you are a technical analysis junkie, this might not be a course for you).","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":82,"name":"DrWealth","description":null,"slug":"dr-wealth","details":{"meta":{"title":"DrWealth Investment Courses | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, courses available and fees for Investment courses, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"investment courses, singapore, wealth, fees, reviews, seedly, DrWealth, dr, wealth"},"summary":[{"title":"History","description":"Dr Wealth provides trusted financial education to individuals.

Dr Wealth does not impress one ostentatiously with giant corporate names but rather educate one back to the very core of value investing. \nBefore attending the FBIC course, I still harboured scepticism of how much would they impart their knowledge to those that are not in the game. I was proven wrong, Dr Wealth's team patiently coached me on understanding the intimidating financial reports, factors to analyse the stocks and with the correct strategy. Within the program, teachings are put into practical stimulations, no fancy software, just working through the compendium of notes they provided. This gave me more confidences even Alvin did emphasis frequently as a reminder historical data is not indicative of future progress. \nDr Wealth does follow-ups with the graduates from the FBIC course. \n\nI was so sold by their fastidious methods, genuine personalities without gimmicks and went on to join the insider. It is relatively pricey ;'(   , although there are many other premium features that come along, still it hurts my pocket. \n\nAll in all, it is a well paced and gives a good coverage for the intended objective, I truly learnt a great deal from them. \n\nI wish it has a better value of money prices for young investors, who do not have much capital, hence the 4 stars. \n\n","rating":4,"itemId":82,"createdAt":"2018-08-11T03:10:49.056+08:00","updatedAt":"2018-08-11T03:10:49.133+08:00","category":{"id":14,"slug":"investment-courses"},"reviewText":"I had attended other free workshops by others and this is the axiom of value investing. \nI was introduced to Dr Wealth from Cheerful.egg blog.
