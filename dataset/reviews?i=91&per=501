Only setback for Geneco is, they only have e-billing which is separate from SP group. You may want to consider Tuas Power which is under same billing at 17.98 (incl gst) for their 2 years fixed rate.

The current best 2 years fixed rate plan is at 17.52 which iSwitch charges (but they do not have very transparent contract information as well as renewal offer, Hardcopy Billing: $1.07 per Bill (Inc GST) Service fee: $5.297 per month (Inc. GST)) which is lower than the discount tariff in the market. Current tariff is at 25.52 which SP charges and the most consistent discount tariff plan is at 25% lower which will set the tariff at 19.14. For current 2 years fixed rate, the next consistent 2 years fixed rate are from Geneco / Sembcorp / Keppel at 17.78 (includes gst). \n\nGeneco does not require security deposit, absorb the transmission loss charges and they absorbed the carbon tax of 1% which took effect from 2019 (most retailers have opted in to cover these as well for this phase). Geneco is also one of the biggest power house generators in SG. SembCorp requires security deposit whereas Keppel requires installation of advanced smart metre 42.10 (incl gst) applies. On top of this, Geneco has a price match guarantee for their fixed 24 months plan if other retailers offer lower rate within 7 days of signing up. \n\nP.S: other retailers are offering different incentives but ultimately I chose one that is consistent in addressing the big chunk of our monthly household bills.

GST)) which is lower than the discount tariff in the market. Current tariff is at 25.52 which SP charges and the most consistent discount tariff plan is at 25% lower which will set the tariff at 19.14. For current 2 years fixed rate, the next consistent 2 years fixed rate are from Geneco / Sembcorp / Keppel at 17.78 (includes gst). \n\nGeneco does not require security deposit, absorb the transmission loss charges and they absorbed the carbon tax of 1% which took effect from 2019 (most retailers have opted in to cover these as well for this phase). Geneco is also one of the biggest power house generators in SG. SembCorp requires security deposit whereas Keppel requires installation of advanced smart metre 42.10 (incl gst) applies. On top of this, Geneco has a price match guarantee for their fixed 24 months plan if other retailers offer lower rate within 7 days of signing up. \n\nP.S: other retailers are offering different incentives but ultimately I chose one that is consistent in addressing the big chunk of our monthly household bills.

You use someone referral code, you get $20 bucks rebate and they get $20 bucks rebate too. Stackable.

The reasons why I chose Geneco: \n 1) They are very transparent in terms of price, no transmission loss charges, carbon tax absorbed, no hidden cost, no deposit required \n2) They do a price match if you signed up for their 2 yrs plan. I emailed them to price match, and they responded fast- good after sales customer service \n 3) The bill is easy to read, simple, straightforward. My usual electricity bill is around $70. My current bill (based on entire cycle with Geneco) comes up to $44. This is 37% less than the average of $70. The bill has been quite stable as well, $40+ for the past 4 months.\n4) They are one of the main providers and thus reliable. \n\nI would personally recommend the 2 years plan since they do price matching within 7 days. Total possible rebate= $68 + $40 (AMEX credit card) + $20 (referral) = $128.

The reasons why I chose Geneco: \n 1) They are very transparent in terms of price, no transmission loss charges, carbon tax absorbed, no hidden cost, no deposit required \n2) They do a price match if you signed up for their 2 yrs plan. I emailed them to price match, and they responded fast- good after sales customer service \n 3) The bill is easy to read, simple, straightforward. My usual electricity bill is around $70. My current bill (based on entire cycle with Geneco) comes up to $44. This is 37% less than the average of $70. The bill has been quite stable as well, $40+ for the past 4 months.\n4) They are one of the main providers and thus reliable. \n\nI would personally recommend the 2 years plan since they do price matching within 7 days. Total possible rebate= $68 + $40 (AMEX credit card) + $20 (referral) = $128.
