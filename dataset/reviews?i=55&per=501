{"code":"ok","data":[{"id":1012,"text":"A good mile-buying opportunity for 40,000 miles at SGD 488 (for HSBC Premier clients). The unlimited priority pass for both the principal and supplementary cardholder(s) makes this card worth the fee alone -- provided there are supplementary cardholder(s) to share the benefits with and that it will be heavily utilized. Similarly, the departure airport limo service is a plus point and the meet-and-assist can be helpful at overly crowded airports without Fast-Track/ABTC/Diplomatic lines. For HSBC Premier clients, receiving 4 of each benefit upon registration and an additional of each service for every block of SGD 2,000 spent in a month (up to 24 a year) is another worthy benefit of this card -- though the services can only be utilized by the principal cardholder only. This card is overshadowed by its mediocre mile earn rate of 1.0 mpd for local spend and 2.0 mpd for overseas spend, that is superseded by non-fee cards such as the PrviMiles. \n\nBottom Line: If you are both a HSBC Premier client and a frequent traveller that can maximize the number of priority pass visits, limo and meet-and-assist services (and your supplementary cardholders are too), then this is the card for you. The reduced general mile earn rate is worth the trade-off for the unlimited priority pass memberships, as well as the high number of limo and meet-and-assist services that you can use.
