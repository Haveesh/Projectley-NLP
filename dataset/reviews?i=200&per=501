Once I had a double NAT issue with my ONT and I contacted the customer service if they would be as kind as to enable the bridge mode to resolve this issue. The customer service was more than happy to help and said I could bring my ONT over to their office in Kg Ampat to rectify the issue. Upon arriving at their office I was pleased that instead of making me wait (or take a number) for a technician to make the settings on my existing ONT, they recognized that I called earlier and provided me with an ONT that has been configured and I was in and out of the office in less than 2 minutes. \n\nHad this been another provider, I’m not so sure the experience would have been so seamless. I tip my hat to the folks in Whizcomms for a positive customer experience so far. Kudos Whizcomms!","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":200,"name":"WhizComms Broadband","description":null,"slug":"whizcomms-broadband","details":{"meta":{"title":"WhizComms Broadband Reviews","description":"WhizComms Broadband Reviews","keywords":"WhizComms Broadband Reviews"},"summary":[{"title":"24-Month Plans","description":"1Gbps @ $34/month\n300Mbps @ $26/month"},{"title":"12-Month Plans","description":"1Gbps @ $38/month\n300Mbps @ $32/month"}],"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.whizcomms.com.sg/"}]},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/758/original/e3999f5fdf3dc96e2026dd45f6fb0dfffa48e55e.?1559895393","alias":"WhizComms Broadband","categoryId":13,"companyId":200,"rating":4.7,"ratingsCount":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":4,"5":8},"reviewsCount":12},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":55536,"name":"John Khaw","slug":"john-khaw-d7de1c6a-c559-4cd7-bba5-18e6ac246813","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/10214116493968273/picture","answersCount":3,"upvotesCount":6,"reviewsCount":2,"badges":null}},{"id":2061,"text":"Decided to switch to WhizComms broadband for my in-law's home when their contract ended on Dec 18  - they were having a promo and the price for their 1 Gbps plan was one of the cheapest then (definitely look out for promos!).\n\nTheir online response and call centre is responsive and free installation could be arranged on a weekday (9 - 5.30pm).
