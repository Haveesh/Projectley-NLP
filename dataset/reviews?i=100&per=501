{"code":"ok","data":[{"id":1960,"text":"Signed up with Tuas Power today after comparing between Keppel Electric, Geneco, Ohm, iSwitch and Tuas Power. Here's my 9 reasons why I signed up with them after extensive research online and finding out more at their roadshows: 1) Integrated billing means no need to receive two bills, or set up new/additional payment arrangement 2) Billing transparency means having a piece of mind. Have requested to see billing sample from the above retailers. Only Tuas Power shows the usage in figures (i.e. XXX kWh); exactly as what is shown in your SP bill now. Keppel one shows a bar chart with no indication of the exact kWh which leaves room for billing manipulation (although you can log into your SP utilities portal, if you have one, to see the figures). No wonder so many people reviewed about their billing in-transparency. 3) Competitive sign-up incentive.

For roadshow, Keppel offers a total of $50 off bill if payment by UOB, $20 off bill if by other cards. 4) Earn 1 NTUC Link Point for every 8kWh 5) No additional security deposit which some retailers charge. 6) TFL is absorbed. Of the retailers above, only Keppel does not. 7) No relocation fee. Geneco charges a $10.70 fee if you shift house. 8) They have been in business for a long time and own their own power generator, unlike other smaller independent retailers. 9) Roadshow promoters not pushy or touting. To be honest, I went down to the roadshow wanting to sign up with Geneco as many people gave good reviews and the prices shown online by banks are one of the lowest. However, I realised at the roadshow that prices are the same/almost the same across the different retailers for the 2 year fixed package. Keppel had the best sign up incentive especially for UOB card holders and direct rebate to the electricity bill. I finally went ahead with Tuas Power given the plus points mentioned above (esp. billing transparency), positive reviews about its customer service, no-fuss online sign up process, and pretty competitive incentive.","rating":5,"itemId":100,"createdAt":"2019-01-11T22:21:51.624+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-09-15T17:24:07.077+08:00","category":{"id":6,"slug":"open-electricity-market"},"reviewText":"Signed up with Tuas Power today after comparing between Keppel Electric, Geneco, Ohm, iSwitch and Tuas Power.

Reasons for me choosing Tuas Power are: 1) 25% saving in monthly electricity bills (Paying just 17.98cents/kWh instead SP Group rate) 2) I want a hardcopy bill and I don't want to pay a single cents extra for it 3) No security deposit needed if switching from SP Services 4) Better value for money option (i) I do not mind signing for a 24months contract. However, since Tuas Power have a 18-months contract offering the same attractive rate (17.98cents/kWh) as other majority retailers who required to lock you down for 24 months (ii) Given the shorter contract period, I will be able to jump to another retailers to enjoy \"sign up bonus\" and \"attractive market rate\" if Tuas Power failed to retain me as their customer. 5) I am a NTUC Linkpoints customer. Beside the one time 1,000 linkpoints sign up bonus, Tuas Power also provide 1 linkpoint per every 8kWh usage. I love such recurring benefit. 6) I am a POSB Everyday cardholder.
