StarHub’s offers Plan with Device and SIM-only plan (no contract) and the extremely worth it CIS plans. \n\nADDITIONAL SIM?\nThinking of getting additional sim for work related or for someone else? In addition, M1 provides free caller number display for 3 months for new sign-ups or, enjoy free 6 months if you switch to M1. Do you smell the goodness like i do ? \n\nThinking of getting additional SIM for work related or for someone else? Look no further than Starhub’s SIM-only plan. At only $25/monthly, you’re entitled to 15GB data, with FREE weekend data (10GB/day on Sat and Sun). Still worried about not enough data? Get 50GB data with worry-free data for $5.40/month. Online exclusive: $120 bill rebate! \n\nThinking of porting over to StarHub under 2-year plan or CIS plans (depending on your company benefits)?

Usually uses WhatsApp calls but occasionally still have to do normal calls for reservations etc.\n\nSINGTEL:\n\nPros: 10gb/mth @ $36.05 (+2gb if switch to ST on SIM only now) comes with 150mins talk time + 500 free local SMS. Free ST wifi across Singapore if you're ST postpaid customer.\n\nCons: Bad service both at counter and call operator level. I was just changing my phone 6 weeks ago at ST; made appt online but got confusing SMS from ST, called them back and operator told me my collection point is at Jurong when I clearly selected AMK. After arriving at AMK I was made to wait an hour plus for nothing and no service recovery. Also, when you are tied to contract with ST they do not auto upgrade you to be on par with their new packages. Example you registered for 4gb (4g network) @ $65/mth 2 years back; even if new package is $40/mth you'll be charged at $65 even after your contract is over. Also, when I sign up for 4g network I will want 4g network say 80% of the time. Not 3g. ST cheated my feelings.\n\nSTARHUB\n\nPros: 6gb + unlimited weekend data @ $24 (12 mth contract) and if you're overseas you can simply turn on dataroam @ $15 for 2gb (valid 1 mth) so it's really convenient.\n\nThey also used to upgrade existing users FOC to new package so long as you're not under contract. If you were paying $65/mth for 4gb, you may notice you have 6gb because they upgraded you. They will send you a letter to inform you and this is what I like them. Don't think they are doing now though.\n\nCons: Technical glitches. Past 3 months I've been experiencing constant glitches from them. First I had data roam which I used in Taiwan which was okay but when I go to Malaysia the next week it couldn't connect at all. I called in to verify and all was verified ok so I entered Malaysia again the next week and again no signal. Called operator again and was told it is an IT glitch which they are trying to solve (2 weeks at least - really?) Also let's not forget their massive breakdown just last week. My phone is on SH postpaid and my home wireless is SH too. So if there's totally no signal; it's not just cable and fibre broadband issues. Their technical team needs to buck up.\n\nZerox:\n\nPros: unlimited everything for first 3000 sign ups at only $65/mth.\n\nCons: Not for everyone. Do you really need unlimited everything when you can get wireless pretty much everywhere now and cheaper plan @ $30 and below?\n\nCircles life:\n\nPros: 8gb for $28/mth no contract and comes with 100 min talk time... Unlimited WhatsApp free and deliver the constant 4G promise. I stay and live in town but often goes around to East, North and West of SG. While I always get 3G signal in Orchard for ST \u0026 SH, circles life gave me 4G. I did a free trial with circles life last year and it certainly surprises me. Let's not forget free roaming and free caller number display which ST \u0026 SH charges for basic necessities.\n\nCons: No SMS but not a big deal because to be honest you can contact everyone on WhatsApp/line pretty much these days.\n\nSorry for the long post but this is why I chose circles life!

I complained to their CS and their feedback was I terminated the $15 service plus myself from their iphone app and it would automatically switch to $100 plan.  I didn't know this option, never did it and I also cannot find this option in the app. Even there is an option to terminate the second sim, why activate a $100 plan for me?  It is totally a scam. No more \"Scamhub\" for the rest of my life.","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":48,"name":"StarHub","description":null,"slug":"starhub","details":{"meta":{"title":"StarHub Mobile SIM ONLY | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, bundles available, fees and cost options for SIM only mobile plans, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"sim only singapore plans, mobile, data, plans, seedly, StarHub, mobile, Telco"},"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"StarHub was awarded the licence to provide fixed network and mobile services on 7 May 1998."},{"title":"Bundles Available","description":"SIM Only Plans (no-contract or 12 months)\nCombo Bundle Plans (with 24 months contract)"},{"title":"Contract Length","description":"0,12 or 24 months"},{"title":"Data Roaming","description":"Available"}],"info":[{"name":"url","value":"http://www.starhub.com/personal/mobile/mobile-phones-plans/postpaid-plans.html"}]},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/606/original/093afbe9607c1154de11d3f8377f4cafe421a91a.?1559895260","alias":"StarHub","categoryId":7,"companyId":48,"rating":2.8,"ratingsCount":{"1":17,"2":5,"3":12,"4":18,"5":6},"reviewsCount":58},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":67205,"name":"Terry Poon","slug":"terry-poon","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/1177579899089834/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":0,"reviewsCount":1,"badges":null}},{"id":935,"text":"Horrible customer care service.

I've contemplated switching to a sim-only plan but upon calculation, it was cheaper for me to renew my corporate plan and get a new phone (s7 in 2017) along with it.\n\nMy home wifi which is also under starhub has problems every now and then, but at times like that I'm thankful my data still works fine. Connectivity is intermittent sometimes when underground and in lifts, but it seems to be a common problem across telcos so I'm not too hung up on it.
