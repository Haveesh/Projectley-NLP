The application process was really smooth. You just need to move the slider around to customise your mobile plan. All the on-screen instructions and procedures are clear. You just need your phone and bank card ready. I applied online and waited for my new SIM card to arrive. It arrived 3 days later via a courier to your door, both the new phone and SIM card. There's tracking system on where the delivery stage is as well. Especially for those who are new to this MVNO that doesn't have any existing shop, this ensures there's some reliability and assurance. During this period, you're also given a temporary number during the porting process. Though the old number is still available for call.\n\nNETWORK CONNECTIVITY\nI travelled throughout the whole Singapore most of the time. Back then the dead zone was in Yishun area, so I feedback to them via their Facebook page. While on train, there isn't much issue. Possible ones are only when moving across signal towers, like Jurong East to Clementi. There's connection in the underground as well, way better than it started off. And definitely much better than other Big 3, that will even drop to 3G network. Signal in underground is pretty strong and fast, managed to watch a Running Man episode as well underground in the Downtown Line.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE\nThey have a 24-hours service helpline there, if there's no one, it will still be logged on their side and addressed immediately. They are very helpful in answering your questions and doubts. Back then for the Yishun network dead zone, they solve it after you have pinpoint them the exact location that you have found. They will add another repeater in that area. The other time was, during my reservist period. My second phone was still using the whole 2G network under Singtel, before they announced eliminating the network entirely to move towards 3G baseline network. So I asked them if they give another SIM card under the same line, and they said it's possible! \n\nPRICE\nAs I've ported in from other telecom, they will give you another 1GB for only $28/month! No strings attached, no contract liability, as compared to others with a minimal of 2 years contract. What's more, Circles.Life will give 500MB for every 6 months loyalty. Now they introduced a 20GB base plan. Back then I thought old existing users won't get it, just like other telecom that forces you to recontract with them again. But NO, they in fact give you the 20GB as well to enjoy with the rest of the community. \n\nBONUS\nAll your mobile plan are controlled inside an app by theirs. So you can mix-and-match anytime to change and suit your needs. Likewise, if you are planning to go JB, just turn on your data roaming on the app. They are activated a few minutes later! No more asking for roaming services via some website and wait for weeks to process. They now have a quiz section, that if you answered by the majority you get extra data as well! Gone the times you have to struggle, and think of how much data limit you have to plan out for this week, just so you have enough for the remaining days. Going green, the monthly bill payment are stored in the app, no more fussy monthly bill posted to you.

I would recommend this Flexi-Plan to any low data/talktime usage users, such as the elderly or for usage in a spare phone or tablet. \n\n","upvotesCount":1,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":44,"name":"Circles.Life","description":null,"slug":"circles-life","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://pages.circles.life/?utm_source=social\u0026utm_medium=Seedly\u0026utm_campaign=Seedly"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Mobile Virtual Network Operator riding on the M1 Network, started in 2016"},{"title":"Bundles Available","description":"SIM Only Plans (no-contract)"},{"title":"Contract Length","description":"No Contract or 24-months phone instalment plan"},{"title":"Data Roaming","description":"Not Available"}],"meta":{"title":"Circles.Life Mobile SIM ONLY | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, bundles available, fees and cost options for SIM only mobile plans, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"sim only singapore plans, mobile, data, plans, seedly, circles life, mobile, Telco"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/602/original/5671e1dc4311236203289868b14c2af90225ac7f.?1559895246","alias":"Circles.Life","categoryId":7,"companyId":44,"rating":4.5,"ratingsCount":{"1":10,"2":4,"3":12,"4":83,"5":236},"reviewsCount":345},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":79918,"name":"Mosmos Fong","slug":"mosmos-fong","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/10218296733665093/picture","answersCount":1,"upvotesCount":7,"reviewsCount":6,"badges":null}},{"id":4031,"text":"Circles.Life has an easy application process just by doing it online.

They should have all those details which I provided when I signed up on their website right?? Suspicious.\n\nSo I waited, but no call or anything.

Of course this is fine because it was already close to 8PM. \n\nHowever the email to me did say they were going to get back to me on why this has happened. \nAnyway, now the delivery/pick up was rescheduled to 12 September. 1 day gone already.\n\n11 September - Got a call Circles Life late evening around 7PM asking me to confirm my IC number and date of issue. I happened to be in the middle of something that I didn't have wallet with me. But really? Shouldn't they already have such information??? I said to the person I am in the middle of something now I don't have the Issue Date of my IC. He said this is really urgent he's at the warehouse and needs these details to send the package out. I said I don't have the Issue Date, but I can give him my IC number la...he said ok.

You will only pay what you signed up for the second month after.","upvotesCount":1,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":44,"name":"Circles.Life","description":null,"slug":"circles-life","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://pages.circles.life/?utm_source=social\u0026utm_medium=Seedly\u0026utm_campaign=Seedly"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Mobile Virtual Network Operator riding on the M1 Network, started in 2016"},{"title":"Bundles Available","description":"SIM Only Plans (no-contract)"},{"title":"Contract Length","description":"No Contract or 24-months phone instalment plan"},{"title":"Data Roaming","description":"Not Available"}],"meta":{"title":"Circles.Life Mobile SIM ONLY | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, bundles available, fees and cost options for SIM only mobile plans, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"sim only singapore plans, mobile, data, plans, seedly, circles life, mobile, Telco"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/602/original/5671e1dc4311236203289868b14c2af90225ac7f.?1559895246","alias":"Circles.Life","categoryId":7,"companyId":44,"rating":4.5,"ratingsCount":{"1":10,"2":4,"3":12,"4":83,"5":236},"reviewsCount":345},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":47623,"name":"Zahrin Azhari","slug":"zahrin-azhari","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/10213699412533647/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":1,"reviewsCount":1,"badges":null}},{"id":765,"text":"In itself, Circles.Life is a customer-centric, marketing-focused company. \n\nIt leverages on product marketing to differentiate itself, and has been experimenting with various ways to talk to their customers, especially whenever there are inquiries. \n\nI have been a customer since 2016 as an early adopter. \n\nSo far so good...","rating":4,"itemId":44,"createdAt":"2018-08-04T00:37:33.296+08:00","updatedAt":"2018-08-04T00:37:33.424+08:00","category":{"id":7,"slug":"sim-only-mobile-plans"},"reviewText":"In itself, Circles.Life is a customer-centric, marketing-focused company. \n\nIt leverages on product marketing to differentiate itself, and has been experimenting with various ways to talk to their customers, especially whenever there are inquiries. \n\nI have been a customer since 2016 as an early adopter. \n\nSo far so good...","upvotesCount":1,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":44,"name":"Circles.Life","description":null,"slug":"circles-life","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://pages.circles.life/?utm_source=social\u0026utm_medium=Seedly\u0026utm_campaign=Seedly"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Mobile Virtual Network Operator riding on the M1 Network, started in 2016"},{"title":"Bundles Available","description":"SIM Only Plans (no-contract)"},{"title":"Contract Length","description":"No Contract or 24-months phone instalment plan"},{"title":"Data Roaming","description":"Not Available"}],"meta":{"title":"Circles.Life Mobile SIM ONLY | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, bundles available, fees and cost options for SIM only mobile plans, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"sim only singapore plans, mobile, data, plans, seedly, circles life, mobile, Telco"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/602/original/5671e1dc4311236203289868b14c2af90225ac7f.?1559895246","alias":"Circles.Life","categoryId":7,"companyId":44,"rating":4.5,"ratingsCount":{"1":10,"2":4,"3":12,"4":83,"5":236},"reviewsCount":345},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":28508,"name":"Pascal Samsoon","slug":"pascal-samsoon","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/10155474829027933/picture","answersCount":32,"upvotesCount":18,"reviewsCount":2,"badges":null}},{"id":764,"text":"What is better than cheap stuff?

Here are some of the things I like and dislike about it:\n\nConnectivity: For most part of Singapore it's ok, except during a couple of occasions I've had connectivity issues while in a mall or underground (MRT) whereas my SingTel/M1 friends did not.\n\nCustomer Service: Communication with customer service is done via the Circles.Life app. Generally they have been prompt in responding on the live chat, and from past experience they are so much faster than M1 call center! Customer service officers on the other side of the live chat can troubleshoot and make changes to your account for you (for example, I chatted once to request for them to pause my plan for a few months as I was travelling overseas). One downside might be the lack of a human touch, I do miss speaking to a customer service officer over the phone. Circles.Life live chat hours are: Monday - Friday 9am to 10pm, Weekends \u0026 PH 9am to 6pm.\n\nMobile App: Very user friendly compared and modern design, pleasant to use!\n\nDelivery: I remembered when I first signed up for Circles.Life, I was super excited to hear that the SIM card will be delivered to my doorstep! So you complete the process online, wait for your SIM card (along with a few freebies) to arrive, as simple as that.\n\nBirthday treats \u0026 other bonuses: 500MB birthday bonus. When I first signed up there was also a port-in bonus, if you're switching over from another local telco. You also get referral bonus (200 MB per month for every new customer who signs up using your referral code) so there's actually no limit to the amount of bonus data you can get out of Circles.Life. Here are some of the bonuses which I have, according to the app:\n- Happy Birthday! (+500 MB)\n- Loyalty 12 months with Circles (+500MB)\n- Loyalty 6 months with Circles (+500MB)\n- Port-in (+1 GB)\n- App Activation (+1 GB)\n\nOverall Value: I'm paying $28 per month for 6 GB of data, and this is not a SIM only plan (base plan still comes with 100 mins talktime) so this plan is perfect for someone like me who most makes calls, use WhatsApp for communication and generally quite heavy data user (browsing Facebook on MRT haha). I like that Circles have flexibility when you \"over-use\" data: you can choose to auto-boost (e.g. 200 MB for $2) when you're almost out of data (so you never face a situation where you're completely data-less) or switch auto-boost off and purchase additional data at different rates: unlimited ($3 per day), +2.0 GB ($10), +1.0 GB (+$6).

Customer service officers on the other side of the live chat can troubleshoot and make changes to your account for you (for example, I chatted once to request for them to pause my plan for a few months as I was travelling overseas). One downside might be the lack of a human touch, I do miss speaking to a customer service officer over the phone. Circles.Life live chat hours are: Monday - Friday 9am to 10pm, Weekends \u0026 PH 9am to 6pm.\n\nMobile App: Very user friendly compared and modern design, pleasant to use!\n\nDelivery: I remembered when I first signed up for Circles.Life, I was super excited to hear that the SIM card will be delivered to my doorstep! So you complete the process online, wait for your SIM card (along with a few freebies) to arrive, as simple as that.\n\nBirthday treats \u0026 other bonuses: 500MB birthday bonus. When I first signed up there was also a port-in bonus, if you're switching over from another local telco. You also get referral bonus (200 MB per month for every new customer who signs up using your referral code) so there's actually no limit to the amount of bonus data you can get out of Circles.Life. Here are some of the bonuses which I have, according to the app:\n- Happy Birthday! (+500 MB)\n- Loyalty 12 months with Circles (+500MB)\n- Loyalty 6 months with Circles (+500MB)\n- Port-in (+1 GB)\n- App Activation (+1 GB)\n\nOverall Value: I'm paying $28 per month for 6 GB of data, and this is not a SIM only plan (base plan still comes with 100 mins talktime) so this plan is perfect for someone like me who most makes calls, use WhatsApp for communication and generally quite heavy data user (browsing Facebook on MRT haha). I like that Circles have flexibility when you \"over-use\" data: you can choose to auto-boost (e.g. 200 MB for $2) when you're almost out of data (so you never face a situation where you're completely data-less) or switch auto-boost off and purchase additional data at different rates: unlimited ($3 per day), +2.0 GB ($10), +1.0 GB (+$6).

There's no need to listen to the pre-recorded customer service voice and press numbers or chat to a non-understanding bot. \n\n- Finally, most importantly, the recent additional free 20 GB per month for $28 is too good to be true but it's true.\n\n- The only downside is that the infrastructure is that of M1 which does not have the best coverage in Singapore but it is not that big a deal.\n\nGreat job Circles.Life, keep it up.","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":44,"name":"Circles.Life","description":null,"slug":"circles-life","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://pages.circles.life/?utm_source=social\u0026utm_medium=Seedly\u0026utm_campaign=Seedly"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Mobile Virtual Network Operator riding on the M1 Network, started in 2016"},{"title":"Bundles Available","description":"SIM Only Plans (no-contract)"},{"title":"Contract Length","description":"No Contract or 24-months phone instalment plan"},{"title":"Data Roaming","description":"Not Available"}],"meta":{"title":"Circles.Life Mobile SIM ONLY | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, bundles available, fees and cost options for SIM only mobile plans, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"sim only singapore plans, mobile, data, plans, seedly, circles life, mobile, Telco"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/602/original/5671e1dc4311236203289868b14c2af90225ac7f.?1559895246","alias":"Circles.Life","categoryId":7,"companyId":44,"rating":4.5,"ratingsCount":{"1":10,"2":4,"3":12,"4":83,"5":236},"reviewsCount":345},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":46783,"name":"Marian Suwono","slug":"marian-suwono","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/10215667793344338/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":0,"reviewsCount":2,"badges":null}},{"id":4201,"text":"Best telco with professional Customer services by using live chat, say bye to the hassle calling to their hotline and waited for ages.\n\nThey are like my friends, always there ready for the issue I face and of course the satisfied solutions. \n\nNo regret switch from Sxxhub two years ago, and will continue with this great telco, CL is the best.","rating":5,"itemId":44,"createdAt":"2019-08-21T13:45:03.891+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-08-21T13:47:34.350+08:00","category":{"id":7,"slug":"sim-only-mobile-plans"},"reviewText":"Best telco with professional Customer services by using live chat, say bye to the hassle calling to their hotline and waited for ages.\n\nThey are like my friends, always there ready for the issue I face and of course the satisfied solutions. \n\nNo regret switch from Sxxhub two years ago, and will continue with this great telco, CL is the best.","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":44,"name":"Circles.Life","description":null,"slug":"circles-life","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://pages.circles.life/?utm_source=social\u0026utm_medium=Seedly\u0026utm_campaign=Seedly"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Mobile Virtual Network Operator riding on the M1 Network, started in 2016"},{"title":"Bundles Available","description":"SIM Only Plans (no-contract)"},{"title":"Contract Length","description":"No Contract or 24-months phone instalment plan"},{"title":"Data Roaming","description":"Not Available"}],"meta":{"title":"Circles.Life Mobile SIM ONLY | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, bundles available, fees and cost options for SIM only mobile plans, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"sim only singapore plans, mobile, data, plans, seedly, circles life, mobile, Telco"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/602/original/5671e1dc4311236203289868b14c2af90225ac7f.?1559895246","alias":"Circles.Life","categoryId":7,"companyId":44,"rating":4.5,"ratingsCount":{"1":10,"2":4,"3":12,"4":83,"5":236},"reviewsCount":345},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":47022,"name":"Chong Hwi","slug":"chong-hwi","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/10220196351201270/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":0,"reviewsCount":1,"badges":null}},{"id":4200,"text":"My experience was rather rocky as i had many issues with my previous telco .

So it offered the best value among the telcos for the data amount I could get.\n\nThe application process back then was straightforward online, maybe 3 steps process? First, identification, then choose your number, then pay-up and delivery arrangements. Sim card package delivered next day - impressive!\n\nThe reception has been mainly good in most places.

However, I must emphasize that you will not really get signals or connections when youre in the deeper parts of an army camp.\n\nWould recommend Circles.Life to NSFs who needs lots of data but does not have alot of money but works in camps that are very accessible.","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":44,"name":"Circles.Life","description":null,"slug":"circles-life","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://pages.circles.life/?utm_source=social\u0026utm_medium=Seedly\u0026utm_campaign=Seedly"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Mobile Virtual Network Operator riding on the M1 Network, started in 2016"},{"title":"Bundles Available","description":"SIM Only Plans (no-contract)"},{"title":"Contract Length","description":"No Contract or 24-months phone instalment plan"},{"title":"Data Roaming","description":"Not Available"}],"meta":{"title":"Circles.Life Mobile SIM ONLY | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, bundles available, fees and cost options for SIM only mobile plans, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"sim only singapore plans, mobile, data, plans, seedly, circles life, mobile, Telco"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/602/original/5671e1dc4311236203289868b14c2af90225ac7f.?1559895246","alias":"Circles.Life","categoryId":7,"companyId":44,"rating":4.5,"ratingsCount":{"1":10,"2":4,"3":12,"4":83,"5":236},"reviewsCount":345},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":35042,"name":"Guang Qi Ong","slug":"guang-qi-ong","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/2145256688823993/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":0,"reviewsCount":1,"badges":null}},{"id":728,"text":"Have been with Circles.Life since my M1 Plan ended around Feb 17.

The push factor was that I never, EVER felt like I was being treated like a loyal customer. In fact, I've had too many instances where they were just plain low balling me (e.g. Birthday treats can't be redeemed, mysterious charges on the bill). But it wasn't easy leaving a long-term relationship no matter how detrimental it might be. Plus, I was a singtel circle member so I got free data on Sundays.\n\nThe pitch:\nThen Circles.Life dropped in and offered my company a Corp package. Pretty attractive package with quite a lot of data: 27gb a month.\n\nComing from a 3GB plan where I had to religiously watch every drop of data consumed,  this was a windfall. But that's not the determining factor.\n\nSo I dropped hints on Facebook I was planning to switch and wanted advice from my friends and I also tagged singtel and Circles.Life.\n\nGuess which telco replied? They didn't even have to convince or pitch to me. They just said hi and told me I can contact them for further details.\n\nSo all the other considerations about connectivity, reliability, cost comparisons, value, etc. faded into the background because really, for a telco or any organisation to reach out to their customers so readily and easily, that's nothing to be sniffed at. I would know because my 2 jobs have been at organisations that are customer focused. And it makes a world of difference to know the organisation I'm paying for the service, gives enough of a damn to want to talk to me. Or at the very least, gives enough of a damn to spend money to hire people to talk to their customers. Too many other organisations pay lip service to putting their customers first and how they're \"making everyday better\". Who's day exactly? \n\nThat open line of communication is priceless in today's hyper saturated market.\n\nConsideration:\nOf course, as a consumer, I'm price sensitive so I will never say never to changing and Circles.Life has set a pretty high bar for service standards which I hope they can live up to as they scale up. But from what I've seen so far, nobody else comes close as a total package. \n\nPros:\n-Top class customer engagement\n-clear and easy to manage plans \nthe proof of the pudding is in the eating.

The push factor was that I never, EVER felt like I was being treated like a loyal customer. In fact, I've had too many instances where they were just plain low balling me (e.g. Birthday treats can't be redeemed, mysterious charges on the bill). But it wasn't easy leaving a long-term relationship no matter how detrimental it might be. Plus, I was a singtel circle member so I got free data on Sundays.\n\nThe pitch:\nThen Circles.Life dropped in and offered my company a Corp package. Pretty attractive package with quite a lot of data: 27gb a month.\n\nComing from a 3GB plan where I had to religiously watch every drop of data consumed,  this was a windfall. But that's not the determining factor.\n\nSo I dropped hints on Facebook I was planning to switch and wanted advice from my friends and I also tagged singtel and Circles.Life.\n\nGuess which telco replied? They didn't even have to convince or pitch to me. They just said hi and told me I can contact them for further details.\n\nSo all the other considerations about connectivity, reliability, cost comparisons, value, etc. faded into the background because really, for a telco or any organisation to reach out to their customers so readily and easily, that's nothing to be sniffed at. I would know because my 2 jobs have been at organisations that are customer focused. And it makes a world of difference to know the organisation I'm paying for the service, gives enough of a damn to want to talk to me. Or at the very least, gives enough of a damn to spend money to hire people to talk to their customers. Too many other organisations pay lip service to putting their customers first and how they're \"making everyday better\". Who's day exactly? \n\nThat open line of communication is priceless in today's hyper saturated market.\n\nConsideration:\nOf course, as a consumer, I'm price sensitive so I will never say never to changing and Circles.Life has set a pretty high bar for service standards which I hope they can live up to as they scale up. But from what I've seen so far, nobody else comes close as a total package. \n\nPros:\n-Top class customer engagement\n-clear and easy to manage plans \nthe proof of the pudding is in the eating. When others sort to obfuscate by piling all sorts of nonsensical and unnecessary additions into your mobile plan (SMS-es?! Really?! Even illegal money lenders have moved onto WhatsApp.), the simplicity of being able to customise your plan, giving you control over what you really want, is gold dust to consumers.\n\n- good enough connectivity\nI can't say for sure that connectivity is awesome because I'm well aware that Circles.Life is riding on M1's infrastructure which doesn't exactly make one feel like you're walking on sunshine TBH.

However, they hold roadshows from time to time at various parts of Singapore.\n4. Data 'dead' spots - There's reports of certain parts of Singapore where data doesn't exist, for example parts of North East Line faces this problem.\n\nIt's hard not to be biased, but I tried my best to make this review as unbiased as possible. It's also a compilation of my entire Circles.life experience since when I joined, and they definitely deliver an experience that is unbeatable by the main 3 telcos.","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":44,"name":"Circles.Life","description":null,"slug":"circles-life","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://pages.circles.life/?utm_source=social\u0026utm_medium=Seedly\u0026utm_campaign=Seedly"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Mobile Virtual Network Operator riding on the M1 Network, started in 2016"},{"title":"Bundles Available","description":"SIM Only Plans (no-contract)"},{"title":"Contract Length","description":"No Contract or 24-months phone instalment plan"},{"title":"Data Roaming","description":"Not Available"}],"meta":{"title":"Circles.Life Mobile SIM ONLY | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the operations, bundles available, fees and cost options for SIM only mobile plans, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"sim only singapore plans, mobile, data, plans, seedly, circles life, mobile, Telco"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/602/original/5671e1dc4311236203289868b14c2af90225ac7f.?1559895246","alias":"Circles.Life","categoryId":7,"companyId":44,"rating":4.5,"ratingsCount":{"1":10,"2":4,"3":12,"4":83,"5":236},"reviewsCount":345},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":8082,"name":"Terence Ang","slug":"terence-ang","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/10155376122228015/picture","answersCount":6,"upvotesCount":3,"reviewsCount":3,"badges":null}},{"id":705,"text":"Switched over from Singtel.
