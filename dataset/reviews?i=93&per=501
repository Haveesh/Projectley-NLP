I entered my dad's CC details hurriedly a couple of months back in an attempt to lessen all the bill woes of my silly dad but it somehow went into a black hole of data without any verification \u0026 confirmation from Keppel (not even an OTP) and it somehow finally got reflected as the payment mode on the bill 2 months later. \n\ntl;dr: Bill savings from SP's rates is something you can't discount but choose your retailer wisely. A solid billing system, alongside long-term benefits (e.g. rewards/customer care standards) would be what I look for upon the renewal period as lower rates + one-time discount may not be worth the pain and inconvenience bad billing system brings you.

When finally someone from Keppel Electric called but it is to asked me if the AMI meter is installed so that Keppel Electric could proceed with my application. \n\nWhen I highlighted that I already informed Keppel Electric via email that the AMI was installed on 24 May. He responded that they are from different department. When I asked about if my service (in Keppel record) start from 04 Jun, after he checked, he replied yes which basically I had not confident in his answer. \n\nI totally had not idea why Keppel Electric contact me to ask if AMI meter is install then to explain or inform me that the service has started. \n\nI had requested some management from Keppel Electric call back and inform me your investigation result but Keppel Electric keep saying you  have been notified that a customer service representative has contacted me and will assist on my case, but in reality is NO. Only someone to anger me more asking question which I already replied.\n\nMot recent on 15 Jul, received an email from Keppel Electric that they are unable to reach me on the phone but I did not even receive any miss call for past 1 week.\n\nAs far as I am concern, there should be no charges of electricity from SpPower from 04 Jun, if there is, any excess amount from the contract, should be borne by Keppel Electrics.\n\nI really wonder if Keppel Electric really serious about your business?","upvotesCount":1,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":93,"name":"Keppel Electric","description":null,"slug":"keppel-electric","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.keppelelectric.com/?utm_source=Seedly\u0026utm_medium=compare_open-electricity-market\u0026utm_campaign=keppel_electric_promotion_page"},{"name":"promocodequestion","value":"https://seedly.sg/questions/anyone-has-promotional-referral-codes-for-keppel-electric"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Keppel Electric is Singapore’s first homegrown electricity retailer and has more than 18 years of experience in powering Singapore’s electricity grid."},{"title":"Types of plans available","description":"Fixed Rate Plan - FIXED 12/24/36\nDiscount Off Tariff plan - DOT 3/24\nPeak and off-peak plan - KNIGHT"},{"title":"Contract length","description":"Fixed rate: 12 to 36 months (17.68 cents to 18.71 cents per kWh)\nDiscount off Tariff: 2 years (22% off regulated tariff)"}],"meta":{"title":"Keppel Electric | Seedly Reviews","description":"Find out more about the Keppel electric provider, types of plans available, and contract lengths for the new electricity market providers in Singapore, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"electricity, electricity provider, utility, singapore, personal finance, savings, seedly, Keppel, keppelelectric, best electricity"}},"logo":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/002/955/original/288af73751dda4a9f076846c833eff641ef4a94a.png?1561462951","alias":"Keppel Electric","categoryId":6,"companyId":93,"rating":4.1,"ratingsCount":{"1":44,"2":17,"3":25,"4":103,"5":256},"reviewsCount":445},"createdByCurrentUser":false,"user":{"id":81225,"name":"Koh Han Tiang","slug":"koh-han-tiang","image":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.1/10217390447385976/picture","answersCount":0,"upvotesCount":1,"reviewsCount":1,"badges":null}},{"id":3546,"text":"Barely after 3 months of switching over, their rates dropped and I was told that I have to pay the higher rate which I've signed in the contract, which is 36 months.

To my horror, it wasn't and I continued to be billed for almost 1 week.\n3) Called to dispute. Again no follow up.\n4) Few months later they issued a letter of demand for payment despite the invoice dispute. And guess what? When I replied to that email with my explanation, NO REPLY AGAIN!!\n\nWorst experience I had...even worse than Singtel which is notorious for bad service. Avoid at all costs!
