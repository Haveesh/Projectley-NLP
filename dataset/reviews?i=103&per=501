Some things that I really struggle with is the switching of currencies and the withdrawals of money when abroad, but with Revolut, it really simplified things and it also saved me some money!\n\nThe biggest difference though, is that I’m able to send money to friends in different currencies because of the multi wallet and sending money function!\n\nNot to mention, they’re customer service has been marvellous! Prompt and extremely helpful! \n\nIf you’re looking for an efficient, effective and simple card, I would say Revolut is just the card you’ve been looking for! It’s the one for me. :) ","upvotesCount":2,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[{"id":7719,"createdAt":"2019-09-20T13:04:18.692+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T13:04:18.692+08:00","isAnonymous":false,"commentableId":4468,"commentText":"Glad to see you're enjoying the app and card, Tavis! 👊","createdByCurrentUser":false,"product":{"categorySlug":"multi-currency-cards","productSlug":"revolut"},"user":{"id":50185,"name":"Sarveen Chester","slug":"sarveen-chester","image":"https://f.seedly.sg/assets/files/000/003/414/square/fbc3683cd8b05fcb6a2a36f4df3f53970fdf1833.jpg?1568115789"}}],"commentsCount":1,"product":{"id":103,"name":"Revolut","description":null,"slug":"revolut","details":{"info":[{"name":"url","value":"https://www.revolut.com/en-SG/"}],"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"Revolut is an international company started in London in 2015.

I was also introduced to Revolut during the Seeldy x Revolut meet up and am really excited to share my perspective of the product itself. \n\nHonestly, I really love this card and I believe this will be the future of how people are transaction and spending. You may wish to note that Revolut uses Visa whereas it will be a good complement as compared to YouTrip which uses Mastercard. \n\nPro tip: If you're thinking of which muti-currency card to use, here is a simple fuss fre tool: \n- If the rate is good: Change before hand within the app. You get to hedge the amount first. \n- If you're spending on a weekday: Users have been reporting that spending using Revolut is better as it charge inter-bank rate. YouTrip charges a small 0.3% rate against google rate. (i.e. Mastercard determined FX rate).\n- If you're spending on a weekend: Using YouTrip might be better as user reported that Revolut charges 0.5% rate against google rate (hearsay the charges starts from 8am Saturday). \n\nAs there are many features within the product, I will break them down as below: \n\n(1) Topping up\n\nPros: You can top up via any Visa/Matercard. Noted that bank transfer will be added soon in the future versions. \n\nCons: You might wish to note that the MCC code is 6012, which really prevent a lot of credit card from getting point (yes, including UOB). MCC 6012 will be read as a payment to a financial institution. Also, noted that YouTrip cannot be used to top up the card as well. (tried, it failed). Oh, and Amex is not allowed as well. \n\n(2) Bank details \n\nPros: In the near future, we will be able to get our bank details in each currency wallet. This is similar to the \"borderless account\" concept in Transferwise. Pretty cool to not having to set into the country and have a bank account set up. I believe this will be very useful for someone who is receiving foreign currency as a salary/students going for exchange. \n\nCons: The details of when it is release is not out yet and onl Transferwise has such features now. Also, it is only limited a certain number of countries. \n\n(3) Analytics\n\nPros: Making use of data analytics, they are able to break down on how much you spent, on what and your estimated spending for the month (Wow!) After which, they can micro-segmentize the customers based on their spending habbits to get more incentive and cashback. \nCons: Feels like your spending is being watched.\n\n(4) Bank transfer \n\nPros: You can make payment to your bank account/foreign bank account via International Swift Transfer. You money won't be stuck inside there anymore :) \n\nCons: That being said, this is why their MCC Code is 6012. \n\n(5) Exchanging of money \n\nPro: The REALLY cool thing I LOVE about Revolut is how their platform works. You can auto set a target and based on the target, and they will transact if the target you set is met. Save the time to track, and time the market. \n\nIf you do a comparison against YouTrip at real-life rate, you can see the rate at Revolut is slightly better. \n\nCons: You may wish to note that you can only exchange up to $ 9,000. Subsequently, there is 0.5% charge. \n\n(6) Customer service \n\nPros: Live chat 24/7\n\nCons: There is no hotline to call. Yes, you may see a number at the back of your card. But that is only useful if you wish to block your card. There is no human interaction. \n \n\n\n\n\n","rating":5,"itemId":103,"createdAt":"2019-10-02T22:57:12.669+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-10-02T23:55:24.534+08:00","category":{"id":15,"slug":"multi-currency-cards"},"reviewText":"Revolut is a new game-changer in the market with lots of new features that is amazing.
