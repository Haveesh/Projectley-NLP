Yet there's a monthly fee that was hidden in the fact sheet page 2 section C last line: \n\n\"Service fee: $4.95 per month (Exc. GST); $5.297 per month (Inc. GST)\"\n\nAdd up this fee will make it cost more than all other brand. \n\nMost people don't know because it's not obvious in their website and they purposely hide it in fact sheet one small section only. \n\nSo don't ever get from this company. They are not transparent about the true cost.\n\nSo which one is best or most transparent of their price ?
