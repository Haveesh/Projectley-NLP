Received sms that port-in was schedule on Sat 2am.\n\nOverall take around 4 days from signup till service port-in and activated. i was expecting the port-in to fail as i had just transfer the ownership of the phoneline to myself just a day before so was kinda surprise that it went thru. \n\nI'm expecting service/signal quality to be good compare to M1 as i travel to work on purple line. M1 reception is very bad in the purple line tunnel with frequent disconnection.
