After using them extensively for 4 years, they sent me a bill of over 1000 SGD due to data roaming charges even though I had network lock enabled. Turns out that if you are in a country without partner network, the network lock won't prevent you from connecting to networks M1 doesn't partner with. What's more, the information on the M1 app is misleading and unclear. Also, the SMS that is meant to prevent you from incurring data charges of more than 100 dollars is also nonsense - I disabled data roaming immediately and my charge is 10 times more! To top it all, they don't want to waive those charges and they expect me to pay for their mistakes. I am switching to another provider.
