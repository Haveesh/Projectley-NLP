My trip experience is as below: \n\n(1) For my 15 days to New Zealand, I am glad that YouTrip is really user-friendly as it allows me to use in almost all the places within New Zealand (except for the farmers market at Christchurch which some vendor only accept cash). I have a couple of refund (for example hotel deposit, car rental refund etc.) which have to be done within the app, and honestly, it is pretty fuss free. The only small concern during the trip was that the transactions may not show up pretty clearly due to the UI/UX error but I have been able to contact YouTrip staff which was able to generate the report for me to view line by line. \n\n(2) For my 5 days trip to Laos, I have used YouTrip to withdrawl in Laos ATM machine. Note that in Singapore, there is no money changer for Laos. So the only way to change money is to change to USD -\u003e then to Laotian. This resulted in 2 transaction cost. The other way to get cash (as Laos generally do not accept credit card) was to withdrawl via YouTrip. The transaction is capped at 1.5million LAK, at a rate of SGD$5 (Youtrip rate) + 20k LAK ($4). So, we have to do a couple of withdrawl at the ATM for everyone to use. \n\nOverall, with YouTrip in the market, it really have change how I spend my money overseas and travel in general. Really happy about it :) \n\n","rating":5,"itemId":102,"createdAt":"2019-10-02T23:09:23.023+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-10-02T23:09:23.023+08:00","category":{"id":15,"slug":"multi-currency-cards"},"reviewText":"Being the first multi-currency card that is launched in Singapore, YouTrip has revolutionised the market to allow customers to top up to YouTrip via Visa/Mastercard.

Note that in Singapore, there is no money changer for Laos. So the only way to change money is to change to USD -\u003e then to Laotian. This resulted in 2 transaction cost. The other way to get cash (as Laos generally do not accept credit card) was to withdrawl via YouTrip. The transaction is capped at 1.5million LAK, at a rate of SGD$5 (Youtrip rate) + 20k LAK ($4). So, we have to do a couple of withdrawl at the ATM for everyone to use. \n\nOverall, with YouTrip in the market, it really have change how I spend my money overseas and travel in general. Really happy about it :) \n\n","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":102,"name":"YouTrip","description":null,"slug":"youtrip","details":{"meta":{"title":"YouTrip Company | Seedly User Reviews","description":"Read real user reviews about the team, fees, experience, customer service and options for a multi currency product on YouTrip, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"reviews, feedback, comparison, multi-currency, best card, app financial, automated, tracking, exchange rates, youtrip, seedly"},"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"YouTrip is developed by You Technologies Group Limited.

Topping up \u0026 using the card is easy. Downside, I'm not sure if this happens to me only but there are some situation that you aren't able to use the card. For example, topping of fuel with self service kiosk and some online purchases. Hence would recommend that you have an alternative card as a back up, as you don't want to be caught in a situation where you can't pay using the youtrip card.","upvotesCount":0,"downvotesCount":0,"upvoted":false,"downvoted":false,"comments":[],"commentsCount":0,"product":{"id":102,"name":"YouTrip","description":null,"slug":"youtrip","details":{"meta":{"title":"YouTrip Company | Seedly User Reviews","description":"Read real user reviews about the team, fees, experience, customer service and options for a multi currency product on YouTrip, and decide if it is the best for you.","keywords":"reviews, feedback, comparison, multi-currency, best card, app financial, automated, tracking, exchange rates, youtrip, seedly"},"summary":[{"title":"Operations","description":"YouTrip is developed by You Technologies Group Limited.
