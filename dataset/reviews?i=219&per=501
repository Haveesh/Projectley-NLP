{"code":"ok","data":[{"id":3912,"text":"I had signup and ported to Amazing 8 plan (Promo Launch) at $8/including GST on the second day of launch in June at their local agent store in Jurong West HDB. \n\nMy Amazing 8 Plan (Promo Launch) includes 2GB Data with Unlimited Basic Internet at 128kbps thereafter, Free incoming calls, 150 minutes outgoing calls and 10 SMS. No contract, free SIM card and free wavier of $10 registration fee. Roaming data to Malaysia is free.\n\nSigning up at their local agent store was a breeze, took just 10 minutes in total. The agent took out a redONE tablet, keyed in my personal particulars, including a digital photograph of my NRIC. I was given a new redONE SIM card. NO payment was given. The billing cycle will start from every 1st of the month. \n\nI was surprised how efficient their backend was. The redONE SIM card was activated immediately after signup. Porting from M1 was processed and completed in the evening at 6PM on the same day. \n\nredONE piggybank on Starhub network. Reception wise on 4G network, on above ground and in buildings/shopping malls are excellent. I could get full signal bar on my mobile phone. Calls are crystal clear and I have never experience any drop connection.  \n\nHowever, in the MRT underground stations and moving train, data reception is patchy especially along EAST-WEST Line. Although I get a full bar connection signal, data speed on 4G network is slow and sometimes loading of website or facebook is not possible. I have to manually switch to 3G network to get any data coming in. \n\nOn data roaming in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, I could manually connect to Maxis or Digi but not redONE. Strange, I was wondering why. The data speed at 4G network was painfully slow, using Whatsapp chat and Facebook Lite were possible but slow. Instagram and google map were unable to load. \n\nI have realised that redONE counts data in blocks of 1MB instead of 100KB in other Telcos during their first 2 months of launch. Hence, I was wondering why my base bundle of 2GB ran out so fast. Unlimited data speed at 128kbps after 2GB base bundle was usable. Whatapp chat, Facebook Lite and Opera Mini were usable, but slow. Nothing loads on Google map and Youtube. After my feedback to redONE, they now counts data in blocks of 100KB starting from August 2019.  \n\nredONE has a simple 1app which I could install to view my usage, enabling my IDD/Roaming, adding extra data at a cost and view/pay monthly bill. Notification and payment of bill are all done through the 1app. Currently payment of bill through the app can only be done using e-nets, although I preferred Credit Card payment.\n\nDuring the NDP month of August, every user was given an extra 2GB data allocation. A very nice gesture for their loyal customers to stay onto their subscription with them. \n\nHowever, current $8 Amazing 8 Plan promotion, has data allocation of 3GB and 100 minutes outgoing calls. I had contacted redONE if I could upgrade to this plan. The answer was 'NO'. I was slightly disappointed that even I was on a no-contract plan, I could not upgrade or downgrade my mobile plan. \n\nNevertheless, overall using redONE was trouble-free and fuss-free. The pricing alone at $8/month was super attractive even for a light to medium data user, without any worries for hefty extra data charges in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\n\n","rating":5,"itemId":219,"createdAt":"2019-08-14T20:02:02.729+08:00","updatedAt":"2019-08-14T20:15:11.812+08:00","category":{"id":7,"slug":"sim-only-mobile-plans"},"reviewText":"I had signup and ported to Amazing 8 plan (Promo Launch) at $8/including GST on the second day of launch in June at their local agent store in Jurong West HDB. \n\nMy Amazing 8 Plan (Promo Launch) includes 2GB Data with Unlimited Basic Internet at 128kbps thereafter, Free incoming calls, 150 minutes outgoing calls and 10 SMS.
